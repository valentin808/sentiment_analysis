"If you want a movie full of explosions and fighting robots, this is the movie you need to see. Although, it would have been a shorter movie if they didn't go slo-mo during a lot of the fight scenes (which is all right, because it's cool).","May 26, 2019",8,/10
"Transformers is a great movie with a pretty good storyline and a decent cast.It is a bit long but the two and a half hours fly by.I enjoyed the action in the movie,although it did go on a bit too long many times,sometimes so much that you would forget whats happening,but it is very well directed by Michael Bay.I enjoyed Shia LaBeouf a lot in this,but,although she is very attractive,Megan Fox is not a very good actress,I feel like she just says her lines and she probably wouldn't have got in to acting if it wasn't for how good looking she is,I definitely think a better actress like Emma Stone or Amanda Seyfried could have put in a better performance as this character.The best part for me is without a doubt the robots themselves,Optimus Prime,Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots and Decepticons are beautifully animated and the voice work is outstanding.While Transformers has many flaws,its still very enjoyable and I would recommend it to all fans of Michael Bay and the Transformers in general.A long fighting race of robots,the Autobots and the Decepticons,head to Earth and one young teenager might be able to fix things.","Oct 1, 2013",8,/10
"No, it is not a smart movie, or a well written one, but this movie certainly has it's goods, and one can hardly deny it is fairly entertaining.The goods were pretty obvious. Stunning visuals, brilliant editing, mind-blowing set pieces, say about mister Bay what you will, he has always had an eye for the visual. And this is an absolute plus to all his work, basically. But we can also state that Bay's previous work, with a few exception, was nonetheless fairly disappointing. Transformers went further than just the visual shebang.The movie had a good sense of humor too. It was clear that everyone knew that one can hardly take a few car robots seriously, and so no one didn't. Which is a good thing. It made the movie one hell of a lot funnier. The actor's were cool too. Shia LaBouf is a great lead role, John Turturro, John Voight, Anthony Anders and others had really cool side roles, and they made the movie worthwhile.The only downs were the ridiculousness that often crawled onto the screen, of course fault to the slightly preposterous script. Usually I cringe with issues like these, but aforementioned points somehow made the movie awfully amusing. A great watch, especially in the cinemas, but maybe somewhat less entertaining to watch on a TV. be warned","Aug 21, 2007",8,/10
"Sometimes (probably more often than not in this day and age), movies are not meant to be intensely analyzed and picked apart. If one were to do that to ""Transformers"", the review would likely come back a negative one. However, this flick requires its viewers to be one simple thing: sit back and enjoy the ride! If that can be done, ""Transformers"" will thoroughly entertain you.For a basic plot summary, ""Transformers"" focuses on high school student Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). While leading a relatively normal teenage life and trying to get the ""hot girl"" of his dreams Mikaela Barnes (Megan Fox), Sam is swept into an invasion of Earth by the evil Decepticons transformer robots. Allying with the U.S. government and the benevolent Autobots, Sam becomes central to the action due to his family lineage.If one could ever classify a film as ""whiz-bang"", this one be the textbook definition of that statement. It has everything most cinema fans want: pulse-pounding action, cool gadgets, romance, and a script that never takes a down moment...the action is always moving forward.What makes ""Transformers"" a truly quality experience, however, is the fact that the plot and characters contain a great deal of heart. The plot isn't Shakespeare, of course, but who can't relate to ""good vs. evil""? LaBeouf is absolutely perfect as Witwicky, while Fox turned herself into a national sex symbol simply by playing ""that hot girl from high school that all the boys lusted over"" & leaning over the engine of a car (!). Again, a set of characters that most individuals can relate to.Overall, ""Transformers"" will sweep you away if you can let it. Instead of nit-picking or analyzing ""the small stuff"", this is one to ""get your popcorn ready"" for!","Mar 7, 2017",9,/10
"I expected this to be an action movie only, but it also has a lot of hilarious jokes similar to American Pie, such as when the robots were making lots of noise, Sam's parents asked him something embarrassing. There is some action, but there is also drama. At least the action and drama aren't so bad. However, the characters weren't so likable. Megan Fox was just eye candy (yes, she was hot, at least) and Shia LaBeouf was not a likable character.Pros:Really funnyGood actionCons:Characters aren't so likableReview: 8","Jun 28, 2015",,
"When I saw Transformers, I will admit I wasn't expecting much. And you know what I thought it was a good movie. It is far from the best movie ever made, but it is well worth watching for a number of reasons.The best thing about the movie was the visual/special effects. They were absolutely mind-blowing, and the whole movie is worth the look just for them alone. And the robots especially Megatron were convincing enough, and the movements weren't jerky in any way. The sound is absolutely terrific, and the music is great. The storyline is original, fast-paced and gripping on the most part. There is some nice humour thrown into the mix, however the dialogue for me was a little too cheesy in places.The performances are spirited and bring a sense of fun to the proceedings. Shia LeBoeuf brings some charisma and appeal to the title role of Sam, and Megan Fox is hot. John Tuturro has fun in his role, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White are both hilarious as Sam's parents. Hugo Weaving is superb as Megatron, and Peter Cullen makes the most of his character Optimus Prime. In fact, the only weak performance came from the talented Jon Voight, he just seemed out of place. And while there are plenty of visual thrills, I wasn't a massive fan of Michael Bay's direction, it just seemed as though the visuals, story and performances were doing the work and Bay was just there making sure it was all going to plan.Overall, it is flawed but Transformers while not the best or worst of its genre is worth the look, especially if you are looking for terrific visuals, great sound and a good story. That way, if you overlook the flaws it does indeed have, you are in for a treat. 7/10 Bethany Cox","Nov 11, 2009",7,/10
It's August 9th 2020. I am watching this again for the 100th time. Never thought about reviewing it until now. As a massive fan in the 80s I was obsessed with the Comics (have them all) the toys and the tv cartoon. When I learned this was being made I had zero expectations except the trailers making it look something special. It really did not disappoint. The CGIof the robots is brilliant. The story is something that falls in line with the source material which okay isn't the most amazing of stories however it's a modern twist with elements of subtle comedy a real babe in Megan and a badass Megatron. I know people were upset with the decision to scrap Megatron turning into a gun but how would it have worked? This is by far the best of all the movies made so far. If you are a real fan you'll appreciate the efforts made I know I am.,"Aug 9, 2020",10,/10

"I really love that movie! a masterpiece of Sci-fi genre with amazing visual effects and cutting edge action sequences by action mastermind Michael Bay.
I can't remember how many times have watched that movie but every time i want to have fun and enjoy amazing visuals i try Transformers 2007 again.
But annoying thing about the movie is that academy ignored that amazing visual effects and gave Oscar to garbage movie named golden comps. shame on you academy. brainless and stupid people of academy are blind to awesome stuff like TRANSFORMERS.
Thank you dear Michael Bay!","Dec 11, 2020",10,/10
"This movie is ACTION. I say this first because if you think this movie will be anything more than this, you will be disappointed on some level (as I was). Frame for frame this movie screams Michael Bay.Now that's out of the way, there's a lot of stuff here that works and a lot that doesn't. It's a good thing that the robots do work. Seeing autobots and decepticons in glorious photo-realistic CGI is enough to wring out any childhood fantasy from anybody (not just boys from the 80s). Watching these robots move is to realize a revelation to what is possible with modern movie effects. Whether it's transforming on the move, bashing the living daylights out of each other, or just standing and talking, these guys alone make the movie work. And unlike the other blockbusters that have came out this year, these effects have a sense of weight that adds so much to the visual satisfaction.As for everything else, well... that's when things start to go downhill. In typical epic fashion, this movie contains a sprawling cast. Along with this however, are a large number of writing and acting issues. With such a large number of underdeveloped characters, names are pretty much luxury. Also, most of the human related humor gags miss badly, which makes it hurt more considering a lot of the characters were unnecessary. Jon Voight's Secretary of Defense character completely baffles me, which makes me think that audiences responded positively to the President in Independence Day doing aerial dogfights. Any positives from the supporting cast (including the strange yet entertaining overacting of John Turturro) are outweighed by the large set of negatives.However, the cast has got it where it counts. Shia Lebeouf plays an important part in selling the reality of the robots as the lead character Sam, and also carries an easy likability factor. Megan Fox's acting does a reasonable job bringing some interest to her character to beyond her looks. The voice cast also does an overall superb job. Peter Cullen IS Prime, and although his dialogue does border on the ridiculous, he always has a sense of gravity to his lines. Hugo Weaving also does an equally commendable job as Megatron (His booming entrance will forever be embedded into the minds of little kids everywhere). The rest of the transformers don't say much, which is a shame because I wanted to see so much more interplay between them (The taunts that Optimus and Megatron yell as their fighting is great stuff).Another major gripe I have is Bay's ADD editing. Although it does keep the movie constantly moving, it creates some issues with continuity and distracts from some of the action (probably the biggest crime committed in the movie).I could go on and on about the good things (Bumblebee, Frenzy) and the bad things (Anthony Anderson and his family, forgotten Barricade) and the downright weird things (Dubya's cameo, Sam's friend climbing in a tree). Overall, the film delivers where it really matters. Although I was disappointed, the amount of potential for the sequel (which just got greenlighted) just gets me giddy (is it too much to ask for a tighter script and better acting?) (Also, the Autobot Assemble scene is one of the coolest things I've seen in theaters in years.)","Jul 2, 2007",7,/10

"Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay team up for the exciting and action packed blockbuster Transformers. Earth becomes caught up in a war between two groups of alien robots that have come in search of a device that gave life to their planet. That cast includes Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, John Turturro, and Jon Voight, who all bring a certain charisma to the film. But the real stars of the film are the special effects, which are amazing. And Michael Bay does an excellent job at delivering high energy action sequences that are visually stunning. The writing is exceptionally poor and the film goes on for far too long, but the action and the visual effects keep the audience engaged. Transformers is messy and cheesy, and sophomoric...but it's also a lot of fun and immensely entertaining.","Mar 5, 2020",,

"I watched this film at an advanced screening in New Zealand. I loved Transformers as a child, but was not a die hard fan, so I did not complain over the changes. However, I had decent expectations for this movie as people were saying it's better than expected.I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. However, it did fall a little flat on what I expected it to be. It's Michael Bay, ladies and gents, don't expect anything more.Transformers begins with the reason for the alien robots' existence. How the all important AllSpark (essentially the life giver) was lost into the vacuum of space after the robots divided between good and evil. Falling onto Earth, a handful of these entities travelled the galaxy to find this all important device. Great premise, but how about the execution? Visually, the film is astounding. ILM have outdone themselves once again and have created top notch visuals for others to measure up to. The robots look real, feel weighty yet elegant, and with every Bay movie, there are explosions. And what beautiful explosions they are. This is complemented with a hit-and-miss musical score. At times, the score is cinematic brilliance. At other times, you wonder why Linkin Park was included, when sequences with emotional pieces are suddenly juxtaposed with the current Billboard Hot 100.The acting is competent. I thought that with a cast mostly compromised of underwear models and hip hop artists, I would be disappointed. Shia LaBeouf (Sam Witwicky), Josh Duhamel (Cpt. Lennox), Tyrese Gibson (Sgt. Epps), and even Megan Fox (Mikaela) delivered surprisingly well. Even with Jon Voigt in the cast, you cannot see a distinct line in ability between the seasoned vet and relative new comers. But although the acting was top notch, it was severely hampered by the script.The script, to put it frankly, does not take itself seriously. At all. Firstly, there was a lack of story. Autobots and Decepticons want the AllSpark. One wants to defend it. The other wants to use it. Battle. Fin. Secondly, I could not remember one scene that did not have some humorous one liner put in to make the audience laugh. Even in the most grave of sequences, did some joker blurt out something (admittedly) funny, making you wonder ""Wait.... Earth's in danger, and you're cuing for a crash on the drums?!"" Some of the script was clever, and in the parts which were appropriately funny, hit the nail on the head (Shia LaBeouf is a child prodigy in comedy).Transformers. Everyone wants to know ""What about the Transformers?"". Well, personally, they were simply awesome. They could have been more 2D than they were and I still would have liked them. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Jazz, Frenzy, Ratchet... Megatron, Starscream, Bonecrusher, Barricade and Ironhide -- they were masterfully put on film.However, only two of those actually got a decent amount of character development -- Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. Bumblebee, being the first Transformer Sam sees, and Optimus, of course gets plenty of screen time being the Autobot leader. It's a shame that the Decepticons were only there to be the ""bad guys"", even Megatron. It would have definitely benefited the movie if all the robots were fleshed out and given some emotional attachment to the crowd. It doesn't, and this does have a few repercussions towards the end of the movie. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable to see them wreak havoc in different countries, and with the inevitable sequel, one can only hope that we get to know more about these ""loveable"" mechanical beings.It is definitely the must see summer flick of the year, and whilst not Oscar material, it is one of the best 'popcorn' movies of recent times.7.5/10**Upon a second screening, I found the impact of the movie to remain just the same as the first. In certain aspects, that impact heightened. New score 8/10","Jun 27, 2007",7,/10
"I was not a Transformers kid when I grew up in the 80's and I think that's why I wasn't so hard on Michael Bay's film when I caught it in the summer of 2007. Going into the film for the first time, the only characters I knew by name were Optimus Prime, Megatron, and Bumblebee (and I only knew of him through the mention of friends). So, without having the fanboy mentality, I was able to enjoy the movie as it was...and I did. I thought it was a fun action flick and one of the best popcorn movies from the year. Based on the Hasbro toyline and it's resulting animated series/comics, the film follows high-schooler Sam Witwicky who discovers his Camaro is a shape-shifting alien robot; he is soon brought into the middle of a war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, warring factions of a race of sentient robots.Let's be honest. The only things that matter about this movie are the special effects and the action sequences. ILM did a fantastic job with the Transformers in this film. The robots look amazing and their transformations are seamless. I've heard that some classic fans aren't satisfied with their designs but I felt they did a good job adding what realism they could to giant fighting robots. The action sequences aren't as abundant as one would expect, but I'm not complaining. I felt there were enough action scenes without going overboard and drowning out story. The battles feel epic and they aren't heavily edited into quick jump cuts so you can still understand what is going on.The cast does an adequate job and keep the movie from feeling B-grade. Shia LaBeouf was charismatic and had a good sense of comedic timing; John Turturro was a fun addition as the mental Sector 7 agent Simmons. Jon Voight seemed almost out of place in the film, though added a bit of class. I know there have been a lot of complaints about human characters in the movie, but it's a necessary element and I'm not complaining. The supporting cast did a great job; my favorites had to be Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's eccentric parents. I felt the movie shouldn't have gone over 2 hours as it does begin to strain on the patience after a while but it still made for a fun ride.","Aug 17, 2009",8,/10

"Michael Bay has become something of a love to hate guy among certain section of critics, namely those who wants to promote politically correct feminist agenda who think they are better than others and want to inflict their ideals on others.Forget those idiots, just watch the movie for what it is, which is a super fun action pack movie which just about anyone can enjoy. Shia Labeouf is fabulous in this movie and the chemistry between him and Megan fox is great. And lets not forget the Transformers themslves which, even after 10 years, the visuals on these robots are still some of the best you'll ever see.","Feb 21, 2018",9,/10
"It's not a faithful adaptation, that transformers deserves, but now that we have a real Transformers movie, I can appreciate michael bay's first attempt for what it is. ""Transformers"" gives what you'd expect and it delivers it great, with incredible effects and breathtaking action, but then there's the human stuff, I find it kinda hilarious. A lot of the humans are annoying and others are boring but it's their over the top acting and dumb decision making that keep me entertained. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky he is a good enough teen though his motivation for most of the film is Megan Fox. ""Transformers"" is worth watching just for the Transformers themselves with their ground breaking Transformation animation consisting of hundreds of moving parts and the action is just awesome and it's all it needed to be.","Sep 26, 2024",7,/10

"For me just hearing the words ""Autobot"" and ""Decepticon"" brings back so many childhood memories. I was a massive fan of the G1 cartoons (never watched any of the spin-offs) and the Marvel comic books from the UK and US. The cartoon appealed to me as a child, while the comics took the mythos deeper in my teenage years with cosmic battles between Gods, a yin/ yang conversation regarding why certain Transformers are inherently good or evil. It was cracking stuff and it was with a lot of excitement that I greeted news of a new big budget movie.Transformers (2007) delivered! OK, so they fiddled with the origin story a little bit, but so do most of the different versions of the show. I thought they got the major characters spot on. Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron and Starscream were all the same characters as in the TV show and comics. I really liked the fact that Bumblebee could only communicate through radio signals, and, after the execrable scene introducing the minor autobot characters and Optimus Prime's various sermons, really wish that had been the case for all of the autobots. The decepticons are far more interesting, though we see nowhere near enough of Starscream. Megatron and Soundwave are both effective and the best realised characterisations in the film.The humans in the story all do a good job. Shia Lebeouf had not yet been over exposed, and is actually quite entertaining as Spike. Megan Fox was a smoking hot brunette bombshell, still playing a stereotype (hot girl with a blokey hobby who deep down just wants to fit in), but at least not a damsel in distress as we typically see in these films. Spike's parents are awkward, but funny. John Turtorro's character seems to have accidentally stumbled into this film during a coffee break from a Coen brothers film. He seems like he has something much more interesting to do in an edgier film than this one. But his presence, while out of place, is welcome.My big complaint with this is that the the film, after doing a nice job of setting up for a finale, seems to go in light speed in its last twenty minutes. It's often difficult to tell who's fighting who. There's also a death scene that we are supposed to feel sad about, involving a character who's been in a handful of scenes, and had a maximum of two lines of clichéd stereotyped dialogue. The resolution is neat and sets up well for a sequel. Overall, this was a reasonably faithful big screen portrayal of the characters I loved growing up, if not the story. The arrival sequence, and Armageddon-ish soundtrack are both breathtaking and really hammer home a sense of awe and wonder as the Autobots arrive. The awkward attempts by Prime to communicate with humanity are funny. The human characters, apart from Turtorro (who acts like no human I've ever met) all seem to react to the Transformers and their war in the way a normal human being would react. It is a very different back story and beloved elements like the Autobot and decepticons Volcano and underwater bases are lost. But what's left is a the characters we love fighting out the same war, in a way a new generation will find accessible, and didn't alienate me, well not in this original version anyway. I am more than happy to share Optimus, Megatron and Bumblebee with a new generation of fans.","Sep 18, 2012",9,/10
"This movie is simply shocking! The story is taken from a children's cartoon and is now turned into an action packed alien take over the world movie. When I was about to see this movie I suddenly got a thought. What if this movie is just another Independence Day and War of the World. It is unmistakable that aliens taking over the world is an idea that has been worn out but what makes this movie shine is the personality. What its predecessors failed to do was give the alien/robot personality which is very different in Transformers. When one of the Autobots get hurt we can actually feel there pain as if they were human because of there developed characters in this movie. If I may say so myself, this is a must see!","Jul 29, 2007",7,/10

"For those of you who are not fans of Michael Bay: for starters, do not watch this movie. It's really as simple as that. But, I've read some of the negative comments on this film, and it baffles me to read that all this film consists of is hot girls, hot action, and not the greatest acting. Come on, guys. This is a Michael Bay film, and let me emphasize the words MICHAEL BAY. When I think about him, I think about entertainment, and entertainment only, because that is what his films are about. With films like this, I don't go in expecting some great story, with amazing dialogue. This movie is not academy award worthy, nor should it be. This is an action film, that's what it's meant to be, and when it comes to action films, Bay knows how to deliver. Again, the storyline could be better, and Megan Fox could use some acting lessons, but like I said, when you watch these movies, you should watch them for entertainment. So, if you know what this film delivers, and you don't like Michael Bay, then by all means, skip this movie. But, if you do end up watching this movie, and say that it's nothing but a bunch of clanging metal and hot girls, well then, welcome to the world of Michael Bay.

"Fantasy/action/invasion film. Transformers: The Beginning. The launch of Michael Bay's biggest franchise, which even mentions in the film that it is many times better than another of his works, Armageddon. Excellent directing, performances and plot, but also very good work in effects. An invasion film, with plenty of action, romance, but also a special friendship between the new protagonist and an alien robot - transformer. The story of the transformers into a special realization that if one removed the immature elements of Bay would be truly top notch and much more serious film. However, as a whole it is an excellent transfer of transformers on the big screen, and it is clear that it mainly targets young ages, but not young children. More young and teenagers, but of course also nostalgic of those times with the transformers and of course the entire film audience of the genre of action/invasion.

And another highlight of this film is the very capable,calm and well-organised Squat team,how amazing when they fight bravely and brilliantly when they first encountered the abnormal enemy. The trust and dedication they have can be seen through those gripping, fast-pacing fighting scenes. And most of all,the Transformers,they are just powerful and reliable. The relationship between them and human is just simple,they took the responsibility to protect and take care of human,and in turn,human gave their help after misunderstandings.

"For once, what I see in a film is what most others do. So unlike most comments I write, this one will be ""mainstream.""The way this is put together is based on fractional narrative. Its the notion that if you leave big holes in the story, things are stronger than if you seek to explain and fully reveal everything. Its a solid technique, often used in the story itself. Its used that way here, almost automatically as the cosmology invented here was devised for what, 8 year old toy consumers. But its extended. One extension may be an accident: characters appear and disappear at random with none of the completion or agency that we expect. I believe that's because Bay is a nitwit in this department and the guys in the front office thought it wouldn't matter. Also, its likely that Bay shot a 6 hour movie that makes some sense storywise and then he took out all the parts that got in the way of the ""value.""But there's another ""incomplete narrative"" element that I think was by design. The camera sees and understands very little of what is going on in the battles. The camera is looking in the wrong directions, is too close, shifts in panic and jumps from view to view (when close in) as if it didn't actually know what was to happen next. So you don't actually ""see"" a full transformation, or a battle event. Often you can't tell who are the good and bad robots. Often you cannot tell actually who's up and who's down as you could, say in your classical fight, all of which it seems come from that 1938 ""Robin Hood"" sword fight at the end.This cinematic technique is not new or novel. Its the first resort of filmmakers whose CGI aspirations outstrip the budget. But this is a whole new reason: that business of what you don't actually see is always grander than what you do.Combined with this is a second phenomenon, and here it fits perfectly. Its the use of the dimensional camera. In this case, sometimes the camera is as a human would act. Sometimes it is disembodied, but there's a very strict vocabulary here too, determined by the restrictions of cranes and helicopters. What we have now is something new, the camera that flits, that moves in all three dimensions. We saw it first on 100% animated cartoons. I think ""Treasure Planet"" was made just to test this. Pixar created a whole philosophy and took over Disney based on it.Then we saw it in CGI-heavy films. It was thrilling in ""Van Helsing,"" and there a new convention was tried: show something on screen that has similar behavior to the eye we will shift into. In Van Helsing's case, it was the three flying harpies, in particular (of course) the redheaded one. She flits with precisely the same gestures as the camera.Then we saw it full bore in ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" and ""Kong Kong."" In the former it was architectural, and the latter fully integrated into the action. WETA led the way on this. There's a new technology that makes this within reach of even dopes like Bay. Its called preanimation, and what it does is completely model the scene before any work starts so that the camera has absolute freedom and isn't static as storyboards would have it. Then the virtual worlds and real shots are just busy work, all the creativity is in the design at this stage.You can see precisely which sequences were done by the preamination ""director,"" and which by Bay. The new ""law"" is followed in the sense that we have an on-screen avatar as exemplar of the flitting eye movements. Its a hypercaffeinated skeletal robot. It helps us understand how the eye moves and why it sees incompletely.Oh, and its not an offhand thing that the central goal of the plot is a search for ""spectacles.""So when you see this, and you wonder about whether we are worth saving as a people (which is the reason for the story), and you seriously do teeter on indecision, consider this: we are evolving very quickly in the way we see, the way we model things visually and the way introspective representations are internalized. For that alone, we deserve a chance at survival.Until next summer.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","Jul 4, 2007",,
"It's far from a subtle work, and its action definitely takes place of a decent screenplay- but somehow Transformers is just enjoyable and entertaining enough to make for quite a fun ride. First off, needless to say really, the CGI is amazing. Not only does it continue to age rather well, but was certainly very ahead of its time. The acting isn't anything great but Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, and Megan Fox do prove to be charming leads at times- and are very entertaining to watch- despite their horribly written dialogue at times. The action scenes can feel a bit too drawn out at times, but when it works, it works very well, and it's certainly impressive to see these iconic characters at this scale. Its pacing is decent, its soundtrack is rather fitting. Its cinematography is a bit wonky at times, mainly towards the end, but only puts a small inconvenience on the film in total. In the end, Transformers is a mildly enjoyable action flick that certainly doesn't have as much brains as other films today and of the time- but charms just enough to memorable and at times a rather heartfelt and genuine tribute to the toys and cartoon a whole generation grew up on.My Rating: 6.8/10.","Mar 25, 2022",7,/10
"Transformers (2007) is the only best one science fiction action film of the last three movies that I enjoy. Okay it is not the greatest or the best science fiction film but it is still a good one. It's the only, only movie I watch several times. Transformers 2 I watch three times in a row so far and that movie made me exhausted, Transformers 3 I watch it twice. Once on the computer and once on the DVD I rent it in the Library. I have the third movie on DVD till today I haven't watch that DVD and I think I give 13£ for it.I have enjoyed this movie much better than the last three. In Transformers I loved the car chases with Sam, how the story began, than the war and the chase for the glasses All Spark. I love it. I love actor Jon Voight. Now I know why he did not return in the sequels. The movie was really awesome and I can't say anything bad about it. It had a great plot great action and great excitement.This movie is great out of the four, which I think Age of Extinction is the worst one so far, over too long. Shia does an amazing job, the soundtrack is awesome and the special effects/sounds are ""out of this world."" I REALLY Love Transformers! A big fan of the original cartoon I grew up with the cartoon's as a kid. Could it only disappoint? Especially after all those less than OK ""second generations"" of the Transformers tale, and seeing that everyone's favorite Bumblebee character was no longer a VW bug, but a Camaro? Well, it was fantastic! It was great to see some of the characters adapt and come to life in this version, and the movie provides great action, really good humor and plenty of realistic effects for anyone, not just fans of the old collectibles. But it can only be even more exciting for fans when they are finally re-introduced to Megatron, Optimus, Jazz and more. The film does a great job of creating the feeling of helplessness for humans, which would only make sense against technology like the Transformers. I couldn't help buy find my hands continuously gripping the arm rests tighter, and that was during my second watch! Minus a few cheesy scenarios or brief moments that seem to creep into many an action movie.The Music score by Steve Jablonsky was awesome, I love all the music soundtracks in the film. Transformers is Michael Bay's first attempt of making of a Transformer movie and it succeeds. I saw this film and I was blown away, not only by the story, but how good the CGI of those robots were, these robots were looking like they were walking downtown In Los Angeles, they didn't look like CGI at all. They looked like realistic robots and that was great okay. For a movie that was under $2,000,000 that is right this film cost $150.000.000 and the robots looks that sweet, it was just great okay. The best thing about this film is not Michael bay heavy, you know what that means? It means there is no stupid and I mean stupid dialogues spoken trough the whole movie, the dialogues that was spoke trough whole this movie smart and somewhat funny in most parts funny mainly, it wasn't too over the top were feels like is not funny, that is stupid. Action in this movie is good, the movie is well paced at 2 Hrs. 24 Mins. is not the longest one that was the fourth one. Made was by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures, they a lot and I mean a lot of Disney channel stars in in this film you got a Arwin (Brian Stepanek) from The Suite Life of Zack and Cody and that fat blonde boy that was talking about Armageddon. I think that was a joke that Michael Bay put on him self, this is hundred times better than Armageddon, and I was you mean Aramgeddon the film or the joke, because that was good poke, because Armageddon was awful, that was great I like that part. The mythology that was made for director Michael Bay. This is the beginning of the trilogy that tells the story of the long, galactic feud between the Autobots and their nemesis, the Decepticons. As a child of the '80's, how could you not love Transformers? I love it. I love the science action mythology flick of the first film, which did great. The interstellar battle between the Autobots and Decepticons rains destruction down on planet Earth as director Michael Bay adapts Hasbro and Takara's popular Transformers franchise into a big-budget, live-action summer tent-pole extravaganza in this ambitious sci-fi action feature starring Shia LaBeouf, Tyrese Gibson, Bernie Mac, John Turturro, Jon Voight, and, of course, Optimus Prime and Megatron. Enormous aliens have chosen the third rock from the sun as their ultimate battleground, and as the villainous Decepticons struggle to obtain the key to unlimited power, a young Earthling named Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) may stand as mankind's last hope for survival.I am giving it a 10/10 It is not the greatest movie or the best one but it is a good entertaining film.

"This is where it all started: where big-budget blockbusters started to dumb down at a higher rate, and where Michael Bay's career started to coalesce into the cynical (but very profitable) mess it is today. That being said, TRANSFORMERS is still rather entertaining if you take if for what it is. The plot is as convoluted as expected, yet probably the simplest one in the series. The Autobots must find the Allspark before the Decepticons do, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is an integral part in helping them. Aside from that, you have Michael Bay's usual fixation with military hardware, hot models, cool cars, and 'splosions. He really does have a distinct style in his body of work, for better or worse. Watching it for the second or third time, all I could really think about was how unfunny the humor was, and how the camera-work was headache-inducing. Yet, this first Transformers movie remains watchable if for no other reason than that I know the quality is all downhill from here. The acting is decent, for the most part. The visual effects still hold up really well, even if most of the robot action is obfuscated with clever camera angles and ""shaky cam."" Slow motion is really the only time the viewer is given the opportunity to take in some of the best visual moments. The score is also decent and doesn't really get in the way. When it comes down to it, I don't like this as much as I may have the first time, but it still entertained me. Occasionally, something that speaks to one's inner 12-year-old can be fun, and that's basically what TRANSFORMERS is.","Jul 5, 2015",6,/10

"Transformers is a very mixed bag. There are great things about it and there are some not-so-great things about it...The good:The visual effects. Perhaps the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie. The transformations are amazing not to mention super-awesome. The CGI fits in seamlessly with the live action and it's easy to forget how logistically difficult a lot of it would have been to film.The sound design. The sound effects complement the action perfectly making everything twice as exciting. Probably less acknowledged is the alien atmosphere created by some of the score which heightens the tension very effectively and probably without the majority of the audience noticing.Shia LeBeouf. Without him the movie wouldn't be nearly as engaging. He has natural comic timing and is probably second to none in expressing disbelief of the ""holy crap, there's a giant alien robot transforming in front of me"" variety.The humour. Transformers is funnier than most good comedies which I was not expecting in the least. The transformers themselves are often funnier than they are impressive.The Decepticons. Man are they cool. The opening scene is particularly kick-arse.The bad:Megan Fox. If hot means ""can't act and doesn't weigh much"" then yes, she's very hot. It's not a good sign if you want one of the main characters to die or at least get out of the way and stop trying to act. Her performance just seemed very shallow and probably wasn't helped by her dialogue.The script. Although the overall storyline is good, some of the dialogue is terrible. Too much of the film is spent on mumbo jumbo technical explanations the audience just doesn't care about. The less serious parts of the script work very well though.Michael Bay. Although some of the action scenes are very well put together and the humorous parts are timed very well, Bay can't help but ruin some of the scenes with unnecessarily flashy editing and over the top drama accompanied by none-too-subtle dramatic music. It's not that Michael Bay's style is too loud, it's that it's too clichéd.The music. Nothing new here (other than the alien sounding parts). Practically rips of Batman Begins and is otherwise forgettable. The music should enhance the film by bringing out interesting themes or emotions, not force feeding us the drama we can plainly see on the screen in super slow motion.The ugly:Megatron. He's ugly. And super cool.So, my verdict? The good outweighs the bad pretty comfortably. If you took out the bad you might even have a classic on your hands. Instead you get revolutionary action scenes and some great comedy with Michael Bay's unique brand of mediocre directing sprinkled throughout.","Jun 30, 2007",8,/10

"Transformers brings the titular robots in disguise to the big screen in a bombastic live action debut that's got groundbreaking visual effects and is committed to charting its own path rather than adapting any previous incarnation specifically. It's got Spielbergian wonder mixed with Michael Bay's maximalist and ridiculously patriotic sensibilities for an epic blockbuster that's silly, sincere and all the better for it.Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky may not be the most relatable protagonist to see this world through but he certainly matches the crazed energy of everything around him thanks to his manic presence and he can thankfully tone it down when needed. Megan Fox probably should've been the lead due to her agency in the narrative and her character's more personal connection to her love of cars; however, she's still great when supporting.Keeping Peter Cullen in the role of Optimus Prime is obviously a perfect choice because his voice defines the character and no one has the same level of gravitas. This performance also represents the only time in the Bay films where he gets to bring his optimism and unwavering hopefulness before he becomes a psychopath. Hugo Weaving's voicework combines nicely with a much more viscous design of Megatron to make this rendition work.Michael Bay's direction is superb. There's not a single scene that isn't dynamic in its construction. It is astonishing how well the practical elements are blended with the CGI so Bay can deliver his usual crunchy carnage as well as thrillingly acrobatic robot fights. Whenever the Transformers are just talking to each they are framed perfectly, never losing the overall sense of scale which is insanely impressive for fully CG characters on the first go round.The CGI on display here is some of the best that's ever been put to screen. Every Transformer is a technical marvel of many moving parts to look as real as humanly possible whilst still remaining the unrivalled benchmark for this franchise's live action entries. Steve Jablonsky's score is the finest one he's ever created. It transforms into whatever's needed of it without losing the unashamedly earnest nature that makes it endlessly euphoric.","Dec 20, 2018",10,/10
"You might feel a bit hesitant to watch a movie about cars and household appliances transforming into robots to save the planet-over and over again-but honestly, I found it pretty engaging. It's true that many scenes could have been trimmed or left out, reducing the 2-hour runtime; however, this would likely have sacrificed some of the humor that actor Shia was also able to bring into the role.I get the sense that even the filmmakers didn't expect the movie to be as successful as it was, as the ending didn't exactly set things up for a second or third movie. Despite this, they managed to maintain a solid storyline across the sequels, even tying in historical events to explain certain plot points (from the second film onward), so I have no complaints. Very well done!","Nov 4, 2024",7,/10

"We all knew the Transformers would be well made, well crafted creatures due to the utter genius that is Industrial Light and Maghic. But its too bad the human element was what bogged this movie down.Sure, we'll watch the movie, but there was just too much exposition and for us impatient, Ritalin-riddled miscreants of the world, it was excruciating. First of all, the script was pretty lousy. Now I know the guy who wrote this film supposedly wrote X-Men, but lets face it, that was a good seven years ago. There were plenty of things that could have been chopped out of this film. Now I understand the producers wanted to get a little titillation with Raechel Taylor and Megan Fox, but they were both dead weights to the movie and the movement. Without those two, we could get rid of Anthony Anderson, another waste of words, and maybe even expand Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson's roles. Either way, the female element in the film was completely useless. Let's face it, guys watched this cartoon growing up, and we want action, violence and lots of transforming. Who fricking cares if Shia LeBouf's character gets some action. Its completely irrelevant. It would have also been nice to see some conflict between Megatron and Starscream.The only other thing I didn't like was the awful soundtrack. The strings portion of the film was pretty substandard, borrowing the most generic themes one could possibly imagine. Then there is the random songs and generic heavy metal they try to slip in. It was like the people who mixed the film took a lesson from the dopes that mixed Daredevil, which had an equally awful mixture of CD sales-friendly mixing.But I digress. For those that had doubts about the transforming, it was put to rest rather quickly. Dazzling to say the least, it was as realistic as one could have hoped for, making the transformations rather cool. ILM must have put their best and brightest on this movie, because it certainly shows. This brilliance alone made up for the bad exposition and substandard characters. I gave this film a ""7"" simply because it was entertaining, but they are gonna have to tighten up the screws for future sequels. People won't put up with unnecessary characters and bad music for very long.","Jul 3, 2007",7,/10
"And drive he does as Michael Bay translates the Transformers world of animation and toys to the big screen.But before I get ahead of myself I have to admit I never watched even a single episode growing up. I had just hit high school and I wasn't interested. So there wasn't any real baggage involved either side of the coin.Yet there I sat in the first public screening anywhere on the planet (June 12th in Sydney, Australia, with Michael Bay introducing it) and it just overwhelmed me and everyone else! There was never a dull moment, the script flowed easily, the acting was first-rate and the seamlessness of the CGI and live action was taken to another level.It's going to be the hit of the summer and was better than any of the big third installment trilogies I have just also seen. And I love each of those franchises.Congratulations on a movie that not only met expectations but exceeded them.","Jun 19, 2007",9,/10
"I had gone to see Michael Bay's treatment of Transformers with two things in mind. The first was to expect a no-holds-barred action adventure with Bayish cliché's galore and the second was some respect for its source material (namely hardly any plot or decent acting, just big ass robots kicking ten tin cans or crap out of one another). Now, I have not been disappointed. This film gave me everything I expected from a Transformers film directed by said-Bay. Running at nearly 2½ hours Transformers delivers its content fast, hard, loud and hilariously in places.The return of original Optimus Prime voice actor, Peter Cullen, is a welcome sound to the nostalgic ears and to see the old Gen1 Transformers dukeing it out in spectacular CGI and live action is brilliant.My only little problems with the film were Megan Fox's character, who I could not care less for (just a nice piece of eye candy for us fella's). Other concerns were with its running time with hardly any development in Transformer character was rather irritating and the typical token black guy who has to talk crap all the time is getting a little tiresome with films now-a-days.I suppose my hopes for the next Transformers film would be to get a new director (Bay's first films are good but sequels don't always agree with this man), more Transformers and more of their characteristics  particularly Starscream's desire for power over the Decepticons  and less about the humans, they're developed enough thankyou.","Aug 1, 2007",7,/10

"Transformers wastes no time getting right to the incredible robot action we're all hungering for, and rushes directly from the credits to eye-popping, rampant robot destruction. What really holds the film together though is that even when it's knee deep in save the world, all out, brawling in the streets, giant freaking robot war, at the core of everything is the simple story of a boy and his first car. For a man, there are few things more powerful than the relationship he has with his first automobile, and it's no different for Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf).Transformers is a truly great summer movie. As an action movie it's a huge success; with awe-inspiring effects, tremendous set pieces and jaw-dropping things which you have absolutely never seen before in any other movie. Transformers brings out your inner child from when you first watched the old fashioned animated series on t.v. screen, but only this time it's on the main screen in a movie theatre. This movie is truly fantastic and different from any other movies that I've seen.","Apr 24, 2013",8,/10
"Gotta hand it to Michael Bay, he really knows how to deliver in typical ""Bay"" fashion. Left the screening here in Bangkok a half hour ago and I feel exactly the same way I did after watching The Island, The Rock, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor for the first time -- fulfilled but empty. Bad Boys actually had good character development compared to his later big budget flicks.Anthony Anderson was totally useless here, still wondering why Bay brought him on. Voight started off well but then began to remind me of his Manchurian Candidate character, and soon after that seemed to slip into his Bill Biscane ala Baby Geniuses 2 shtick. Maybe it was just me, Voight's character became irrelevant halfway through this two-hour plus CGI fest. I was actually surprised by Megan Fox, she did a very passable job while LaBeouf was good as usual, nothing great here though. And the usually brilliant John Turturro was a bad choice to play the deadpan secret agent, it was hard to take him seriously in this role. The character was obviously a caricature but Turturro played it up too much, methinks.If you like Bay, you won't be disappointed. Over the top action, good looking girls, unbelievable CGI, even a younger Michael Biehn, played by Josh Duhamel. I know the original series well and I didn't care so much that Bumblebee wasn't a Bug, but the GM product placements were too obvious and overdone. And finally let me say that the storyline left much to be desired. How many times do we have to sit through the long-lost-whatchamacallit- has-been-located- whoever-finds-it-first- rules-the-world plot??? Puh-leeze. It was like another Jon Voight masterpiece, National Treasure, except even less believable.Overall thought, a must see for CGI, robot and Bay fans alike.","Jun 28, 2007",6,/10

"I went into 'Transformers' expecting something that would be good on many levels. I was expecting a well-paced movie with a good story, a good plot, good character development, and of course good special effects. Alas, the only thing this movie really really accomplishes well are special effects. And let me tell you, these effects are totally completely mind-blowingly amazing. To put it bluntly it takes it to a whole other level. This movie sets a benchmark. It will win academy awards for breaking all kinds of special effects barriers.But this unfortunately is the film's one and only ace. I went into this movie expecting an all around good movie. I don't know why I had such high expectations though. One look at who was directing it should have made me know better. Michael Bay. What do you expect? The man doesn't know how to make anything other than big, explosive, shiny, dumb movies that usually do really well at the box office. People like his kind of movies, I guess. But to me, it just seems that they are all rather poorly planned. 'Transformers' isn't well balanced at all. Granted, its a movie about robots, and thats clearly where most of the effort was put. But like others have said, if just a little bit was taken away from the extremely hard-to-follow action scenes and put into a better story with a more intelligent script with more attention to suspense and drama this movie would be much better.Its high point is the incredible special effects, but even the effects are hampered by extremely shaky camera work, unnecessary zooming, panning, rotating, and twisting to make the shot look more ""interesting"" (I suppose). There were times during some of the massive (and I mean MASSIVE) battle scenes were you literally didn't know what the hell was going on. Some battles were really well done - and ironically those were the one's you could actually follow! But most were very shaky, poorly shot, and too close-up to really take in everything that was happening. The robots were of such a high level of detail (which is normally a really good thing) its incredibly hard to see what's what as they swing their arms and legs and jump and fly and run all over each other at a very rapid pace. Was that Megatron or Starscream attacking Optimus Prime? You don't know because everything is moving so fast, the detail level on the robots is so ridiculously fine its hard to really differentiate between them, and the camera is shaking so much. Bumblebee was easy to point out in the battle scenes because he is yellow. So just look for the yellow blurs and flashes and you know you're looking at Bumblebee. The weird part about all of this is that the special effects crew no doubt did an awesome job in animating and detailing the robots. They all look so real and finely detailed -- thats when the camera is steady enough to actually see what they are. But once the fighting begins, its Headache City trying to follow the action. Maybe I'm just getting too old for this. Maybe the kiddies can follow whats going on.Overall, I rate this movie a 6/10. The special effects are totally awesome and I suppose that was the major aim of the movie, which it accomplishes with flying colors. But many scenes were unfortunately degraded by bad camera work. Better directing could have made many of the scenes more suspenseful. And the comedy brings an unwelcome light-hearted feeling that doesn't compliment the huge, violent, and spectacular action pieces.BTW, I don't understand why some people are calling this militaristic propaganda"". I suspect these people are the kind that label everything as ""propaganda"" in knee-jerk fashion, as in ""its all a pro-American military fascist brainwash"" or some BS. Just go home and shut up. This is basically a war movie that takes place in the U.S.A. So, yes, the military will tend to play a large role in war movies -- morons. Get over it.","Jul 2, 2007",6,/10
With a great soundtrack and amazing action scenes Micheal Bay shows what he can pull off when taking a franchise from peoples childhood and bringing it roaring into the 21st century. The special effects in this film certainly do not slack with big explosions and great transformations nothing was held back. With a great storyline mixing action with a slight hint of comedy this film lends itself to both adults and children. With a great main cast and supporting actors this film really does leave you on the edge of your seat. With a band like Linkin Park lending their song What I've Done to this film there was no surprise when the films soundtrack did this movie epic justice.,"Jan 17, 2014",9,/10
"The character development in the film is weak, especially with the Decepticons, who are significantly underdeveloped. The side characters receive more attention than the Transformers themselves. The film is overloaded with characters and subplots, including military personnel, an air force team, analysts, Sector 7, annoying parents, and even a dog.The main characters' performances are flat, and the romantic scenes lack impact. Steve's music is heavily influenced by his mentor Hans Zimmer, with some parts closely resembling the Batman Begins theme. The action scenes are frustrating due to poor cutting methods, excessive zooming, and shaky cam. The colors are oversaturated, and the image resolution in some sequences is low, making it difficult to distinguish between Transformer characters during action scenes. The dialogue is average, and the one-liners did not work.Despite its budget, the CGI work is well done. Overall, the film is a one-time, watchable popcorn movie with hollow characters.","Sep 13, 2024",6,/10

"I don't think I could hate this film if I tried. I'm not trying, but if I was, I don't think I could do it.It has all the elements of the Transformers' glory days, with the juggernaut of Big Hollywood providing the driving engine. I really like its ability to be true to the original and yet be something new at the same time.The nitpicks I have are significant, but a far cry from a dealbreaker. The big one is, about an hour in I leaned in and said to my friend, ""Alright, get to the damn point already!"" It drags too long before getting to the action. Bay should be slapped for some of the soundtrack choices, like when Bumblebee is scanning the newer model Camaro, the song popularized in Kill Bill plays for a second. It was tacky in the Vonage commercials; it's tacky here. The initial chase scene between Bumblebee and Barricade, as well as the hacker subplot, as well as numerous other prime opportunities to have some serious on screen fun, go almost nowhere. The Decepticons' personalities are mostly absent–originally there was much more dimension to them, making the dynamic between the Autobots and the Decepticons as a whole significantly more layered. The competitive relationship between Starscream and Megatron is completely glazed over. Prime's closing stinger line. Ugh. Also, it's plausible that the depiction of FBI raid on the hacker kid's house is at least somewhat racist–moreover, though, fewer ridiculous/absurd caricatures in general probably wouldn't have hurt the film (the sector 7 personnel are played to a ridiculous degree.)But its good qualities far outweigh the nitpicks. Solid plot. Original voice actor playing Prime. Great 'bot design. All original G1 'bots–just with a fancier look (I don't fault them for that, personally). John Turturro. Prime's (and by extension, all Autobots') uncompromising honor and selflessness–something not quite so fashionable in fictional (anti)heros nowadays. The inclusion of beautiful women without flagrantly objectifying them (a bit, yes, but relatively tame by today's standards.) Excellent character development on Sam Witwicky's character–well played, multidimensional, not too subtle and not too overt in any department.And then there is, the only good quality the Transformers ever need: awesome robot death match action. Of which there is no shortage.Easily the most admirable thing about Bay's take on Transformers, however, is that it's garnering a new generation of fans. You can see that plainly if you see it in any suburban afternoon showing and listened to the 8-12 year old ""Ooh!s"" and ""Ahh!s"". It was, in short, really cool to see a new generation of youngsters coming into the same experience I held so dear as a child. I can't wait for 2 and 3, and I really hope they don't go downhill.Bottom line, simply a great, fun movie and a worthy view. Definitely check this one out if you haven't already.","Oct 5, 2016",7,/10

"After a series of disappointments this summer (Spidey 3, Pirates 3, FF2) I was not massively optimistic about this one, especially given the involvement of Michael Bay, despite the decent advance press I'd seen. Well, how wrong was I? This movie absolutely nails it, Bay does a terrific job, Shia LaBeouf is superb, the script is (deliberately) hilarious and the robotsahh, the robots! They're uniformly magnificent, setting a new high-water mark for CGI, and adding everything that they should to this thrill-ride. Speaking as a Transformers G1 toy geek (I can freely quote the mottos from the little stats card that was on the boxes  and Megatron was my favourite) I am totally at ease with the design and vehicle changes that have been made  movies are not toys and it isn't the 80s. Everyone should go see this film to make sure that they do the decent thing and start prepping the sequel immediately!","Aug 12, 2007",9,/10
"Decent film but not enough of the villain for me unfortunately. I did enjoy it though and would definitely watch again. Most of the CGI was good for 2007 and it got me wanting to watch the rest of the franchise. I would recommend to those who haven't seen it before as it is an enjoyable film, especially if you love action.","Nov 5, 2021",7,/10
"At the release of this film, 21 years have passed since the animated film came out. In all that time, we've seen two decades worth of cheesy action films, spirited adventures, imaginative sci-fi, and immense special-effects development. And with director Michael Bay fine-tuning his larger-than-life work style and sense of grandeur, it seems that cinematic fate has cumulated in the creation of this epic film. For fans of the classic cartoons or modern action junkies, the film delivers all the way; the action starts off strong and intense, and hardly lets up. Some scenes are quite awe-inspiring; the opening base attack, the highway chase, the city battle are among the best action scenes in any film. The scope and scale is impressive. The pacing is relentlessly fast. The humor is genuinely amusing and helps keep things light and fresh. It's every bit as big, original, and entertaining as some of the best blockbusters out there, and I think one would be hard-pressed to be bored by it.The story for this could probably be picked apart easily by the most critical viewers (it's especially odd seeing a number of scenes turning from day to night in a matter of seconds). But if you're able and willing to forgive the film for its faults, it is a decently-structured plot with a fine cast of characters. It's pretty fun watching the film kick off with the relationship between a boy and his car; but heck, intergalactic robot war is pretty fun too.The film has awesome photography; there must be thousands of gorgeous postcard-worthy shots throughout. Some scenes are a little shaky and editing is pretty darn fast; it might be a major turn-off for some folks, and I do believe it does make the actual transformers harder to see. But it is still mostly coherent, and helps keep the pacing up. Acting iswhat it is. Shia LaBeouf borders on being annoying, but for his character it's fitting. Megan Fox is a little iffy in this role, but she is a looker. I enjoy Josh Duhamel in his role; Tyrese Gibson and Zack Ward are pretty fun in their parts. I didn't like John Turturro at first, but he grew on me. And of course, the voice-acting (including the talents of Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving) is great. Production value is insanely high, featuring top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects; it's also noteworthy for implementing a huge amount of authentic military hardware and real soldiers in action. Music is pretty darn cool too.Recommended! 4.5/5 (entertainment: 5/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)","Jul 4, 2011",9,/10
"Transformers is a film by Michael Bay, the same man behind such action spectacles as Armageddon, Pearl Harbour and The Rock, which is normally the kind of film I steer clear of. However, I decided to view this upon learning that this time out Bay had traded his producer of those three films, Jerry Bruckheimer, for the more acclaimed Steven Spielberg (arguably the auteur of the Hollywood Blockbuster) and it's probably a good thing that he did, because Transformers delivers.Unfortunately I'm not that familiar with the original cartoon series, so I cannot comment on the films accuracy, but then if the film is meant to be an adaptation - how many adaptations are entirely accurate? I have read some critical reviews of this film and the majority seem to be disgusted at the representation of the Transformers - mainly due to their alteration from the original cartoon. I feel that the film doesn't aim to be a direct replication of a cartoon series, but that it aims to be a blockbuster in homage of a cartoon series and I believe this to be something it does very well. When Hollywood makes these films I am almost sure they have a checklist or a personal routine that the maker (usually the Producer) abides by. Constructing a blockbuster is an intricate process and when Spielberg is involved it is often perfected, Transformers contains many of the elements that are familiar with Spielberg's blockbusters and fantasy's including good old fashioned fighting, aliens, a geek, a computer nerd, a hot chick, a funny fat guy, fast cars, gadgets, an old explorer, secret military layers, secret government divisions, the President, Air Force One, explosions, goodies, baddies, a crack code, a hidden map, polished CGI and many more.In an academic and purely filmic sense, the film is floored on nearly all levels, the acting is poor, the script is bad and there needs to be a lot more work done in post-production, but to attack a film like this would be like a Michelin Star rep attacking McDonald's cuisine  it would be mean and unfair. Films like this serve a purpose, and it is the achievement of that purpose that is carried out very well in Transformers.","Dec 6, 2007",6,/10

"This was a must see when it came out and I've just watched it again 5 years later and still it is one of the best CGI flicks I have seen so far. There's nothing else special in this sci-fi flick to see, just watch it for the effects.The story itself wasn't that weak at all a thing we don't see that often with such kind of flicks. And even the acting was believable. Shia LaBeouf (Sam Witwicky) did a nice job here as the main lead. Of course he's the looser here and becomes the hero, that you could tell even as the flick isn't started yet. His opponent Megan Fox (Mikaela Banes) became the new big thing after Transformers although she was a bit too young aged 21. But she was voted already as one of the sexiest girls on our planet. The producers new it and she was more sexy in the next episode but it also became her downfall.I enjoyed it a lot with all the action going on between the soldiers and the Transformers but also the comedy added. Here and there you will have your laughs. But if you want to see the best CGI so far then see Transformers.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 story 3/5 Comedy 1/5","Dec 17, 2012",8,/10

"Okay, as those who have seen the trailers will figure, the CG is pretty much the cornerstone of this movie. While it probably will blow you away, the novelty eventually wears off and then you wonder: hey, where did the plot go?! But then your attention is quickly drawn back by a giant robot slamming into an office block - or a wonderfully shot car chase; probably some of the most impressive action sequences to ever grace the silver screen.A hefty dose of cheese seems to have been added to the movie, but most of it can be laughed off. One particular scene was reminiscent of the fighter jet in the movie Stealth downloading songs off the internet. A few loose ends in the thin story probably suggest a sequel is coming - but how can anyone have a problem with that! It has its laughs (even if some are cheap) but the 2.5 hours go fast; I'm sure most people will leave the cinema on a high note. Hopefully this movie gets Bay the credit The Island didn't.And a postscript for hardcore Transformers geeks: go with your expectations at your ankles because you're probably going to cringe when something isn't as it should be (although even a minor fan like myself noticed a lack of original transformation noises). But on the whole this movie has plenty more to offer, and appeals to many more people.","Jun 27, 2007",10,/10

"This movie is by no means a challenging one. But I honestly can't see what people expected from a movie about alien robots that change into cars. THE GOOD: The Special effects were awesome. Going into the movie I was prepared for cheesy looking robots. I didn't really think something like that would look good in a live action movie. It wasn't really a concern but I sure am glad I was wrong. They looked really good. Definitely a strong point in the movie. Being a Michael Bay movie of course there is plenty of explosions and such. And I am a simple man. Put giant robots in a movie with lots of explosions and I will be happy. I also don't think Shia was given enough credit for his role. He didn't really have the best lines, but he was very good in his delivery of most of them. He brought some humour to a role that was written to try and be funny, but many of the lines would not have worked if not delivered by someone with talent. He is a better actor than people give him credit for. Megan Fox didn't do to badly herself. The last half hour of the movie was really cool and really captured the way this sort of movie should be.THE BAD: They may have pulled of not being cheesy with the robot's looks, but they didn't do very well with the dialog of the movie. The teen romance plot just seemed unnecessary, and seemed to drag on for a lot longer than was needed. I think Bay may have included in response to people who think his movies are just popcorn flicks. That sort of thing just doesn't seem to work in his movies, and it really didn't work in something that would have worked better as a popcorn movie. The characters were all pretty one dimensional and clichéd. For example Shia's character is a lovable loser and Megan's is a beautiful, but misguided girl.All in all it was a very enjoyable movie that I was more than happy to buy on DVD after seeing it at the cinema. It was in no way perfect, but I am willing to accept the flaws. I found the movie a lot of fun and that's really all I wanted going into it.At this point a sequel looks very good.7.5 Out of 10","May 23, 2008",7,/10

"Michael Bay doesn't disappointed us. I've seen Transformers in a press screening today, and I'm under the film's impression right now. The robots are cool as much as they can be. Bay's vision about the cult-comic and animation of the eighties has become one of the greatest effect-movie of all time. However I must disapprove that the Decepticons lost their personality, they're just mainly destroying and killing machines, Megatron and Starscream are more complex characters like they're featured in the movie. But I don't want to tease. Spielberg and Bay has created a gigantic, spectacular and funny summer blockbuster movie, that the sequel manufacturer studios can consider as an example. So, Transformers is more than meets the eye! And by the way OPTIMUS RULES!!!!","Jun 14, 2007",9,/10
"This was an all around light fun action film with many humorous scenes especially every scene with his parents.There is not any series in terms of blending Computer Generated Imagery, with film locations that has been done masterfully.These are fun films for Generation Xers if they had the ability to do this between 1985-1995 I can't imagine any kid between 9-16 not loving these movies. They'd really have hated the over priced easy to break Transformer toy-line.(Personally I had megaton based on the cartoon transformed into a Giant Desert Eagle 5 foot Caliber gun lol.The main issue though is the action scenes are just too extensive, and can overwhelm the visual senses.Disney has that warning..but on an OLED quality 55-72' set the robot fight scenes can be overwhelming on the senses.The films may have been accepted or reviewed better had they been cut down to 130 minutes max plus credits..But if something can rake in over a billion on a 250 million budget before BLU-Ray and merchandising it will be made.Like anything else movies especially in this genre aren't made to win Oscars but to bring in big bucks.In terms of sequel overkill.... I find Starwars to be more embarrassing as mentioned. The prequels were a nightmare, and JJ plagiarized the first three...Ray is the Emperors Grandaughter...Luke is Vader's son. Mark Hamill was young and mopey now old and grouchy. A Death Star and Star base 1 at least they didn't make a second star base just Imperial Cruiser planet killers.

"I've been looking forward to this movie ever since they started thinking about it. I had such high hopes, then they announced that Michael Bay was going to do it. There was a collective ""Uh-Oh"" from everyone at this announcement given the trail of bad movies he's given us over the years. Over the course of production, the scares kept coming - Megatron's design, no Frank Welker, no Soundwave, Optimus as a different style of truck etc. Hopes started to become dashed. Until the movie came out.I went to a special preview screening, found a good seat and sat down to enjoy the show, trying to forget all the negativity surrounding the movie and trying to clear my head to have an open mind. The film started. From the very opening moment when Optimus Prime started speaking, I was smiling from ear to ear. Optimus is back! So many memories and feelings flood back to me.Bay made a good decision in getting stuck straight into the action. When I saw the very first transformation I just went ""wow"" in the cinema from the awe of watching it happen. The effects were amazing. All the transformations were amazing, for that matter.The film was also really funny - funnier than I expected. Shia LaBoeuf does a fantastic job as the awkward hormonal teenager Sam and puts in a really convincing and funny performance. Josh Duhamel is passable as the typical standard GI Joe movie marine, though thankfully keeping his shouts of ""move"" and ""go go go!"" etc. to a minimum. Jon Voight is...well...Jon Voight. He's not bad, but his character is one of those that won't exactly stick in your head. John Turturro was incredibly funny as the Sector 7 agent Simmons, very over the top, although perhaps a little miscast. Megan Fox is true to her name as the human eye candy in the movie with an interesting back story, though her acting impact is perhaps less potent than that of Shia's. There is a very funny scene with her in Sam's bedroom though. Bernie Mac is also a legend.Who cares about the humans though? We're here for the robots! The transformations were all amazing. The effects are really second to none. Megatron's design was interesting - I didn't think it was great but I'm sure it could have been a lot worse. Frenzy is funny as the angry little spy robot. Prime is brilliant and exudes leadership, but the lips thing...I'm sorry, but it just didn't wash. However, he speaks his lines like we all remember him, especially those lines that are little nods to the original series. Hugo Weaving does an alright job as the voice of Megatron, but I didn't feel it was particularly menacing - more like a standard bad guy voice.There are a few gripes I have with the movie - not enough Megatron, not enough Starscream, the lubricant thing, Prime's lips, calling Brawl Devastator instead, the lack of the original theme music in any form outside the credits, the obvious product placement (some parts look like pure car adverts), the thinness of the other human plots (the hacker group working on the sound was pure silly) and sometimes the screen was just a little too busy.Despite all this, the movie is clearly and easily Bay's best. Say what you want about him, he's given us some awful trash in the past, but occasionally he can put in some nice touches and exciting action, and this movie is tailor made for him. Do not expect the next Citizen Kane or Star Wars - just go in and have some fun. Well worth a watch.Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.","Jul 26, 2007",7,/10
"There are a few plot holes (which is okay for a mindless piece of fluff for the Summer...I know it's not supposed to be Shakespeare)! In addition, the transformers transformed so fast...I couldn't see what was happening. I could not get a clear picture of them. There were only a few times in the movie where you could see the features of the Transformers clearly.It's my understanding there will be a part 2 and part 3. Hopefully, the Transformers will be a little clearer in the sequels (From what I understand there were budget issues so there were a few glimpses of the Transformers but not well-detailed shots throughout the movie).","Jul 21, 2007",9,/10
"The guys in the audience at my screening were practically ejaculating in their seats. This was VERY exciting for them. For me (middle-aged woman), eh. Not so much.(Look at all those 10 star reviews on here. They're all written by these guys.)See there's this 17 year old boy who has a crush on a girl in his class. Who appears to be 30 and a supermodel. When she finds out he's got a car that's an alien robot, she's all over him. (Yes, it's all about boy fantasies.) Keep your little kids (or anyone nightmare-prone) FAR away from this film! A LOT of nightmarish images. Nice people and little kids have very scary pointy metallic objects reaching for them. Or batting them around. (I'm pretty sure a lot of people were killed -- but they glossed over that quickly.) Even tho I'd never seen a Transformer cartoon or toy or whatever the frick these things are, I was able to grasp the plot easily. But the movie just wore me down.These huge piles of garbage (or whatever the frick they are) were hard to wrap my eyes around. When they stood up and moved they were impressive (frightening even). But when they spoke, they just seemed dorky.The movie whip-sawed between goofy comedy and terrifying action movie. Seems to be a mish-mash of styles. It didn't have an even tone. (And yes, I understand about comic relief.) The movie just seemed cobbled together from a lot of different parts -- like the creatures.Around 3/4 of the way thru, I got tired of big things whamming each other and shut my eyes for a few moments. Open my eyes: Still going on. And on and on.I couldn't wait for it to be over. At the end of the movie I was headachy and slightly nauseous.But the guys were jumping in the air. Outside they were peeling out in their over-sized trucks way too fast. (""Look at me! I'm a Transformer!"")Ah. Boys and their toys.If you're a male in real or prolonged adolescence this will probably be the high point of your life.But if you're anyone else, I suggest you find something else in the cineplex to see and let the boys have this one all to themselves.","Jun 28, 2007",6,/10

"I went into this film not knowing much ""Transformers,"" only that they were some toy robots you could re-assemble into other things, like trucks. When they were popular in the '80s, I was not a young kid who cared, being past that age-wise, so I had no preconceived notions about this story.What I found, on the positive end, was a goofy story but a great visual and audio movie, one that I heartily recommend you see on Blu-Ray high-definition, if you have the equipment. You will be blown away by the sharpness of the picture, one of the best BDs I've seen so far.The other highlight to me was the special-effects. These ""transformers,"" aliens who could change shape from cars and trucks into giant robots, was jaw-dropping at times. True, the action was overdone in the last hour, but that's normal for a modern-day action film. Most of it was fun to watch. I preferred the second half of this film, anyway.While it was fun to watch, this movie was not fun to hear, meaning the dialogue, which was extremely annoying, mainly in the first half of the film. Maybe if I was a lot younger I could have enjoyed Shia LeBeouf's wisecracking lead character, ""Sam Witwicky,"" but he was too smug, too obnoxious for me. So were the other ""good-guy"" characters in this story, who were all young, edgy and loud stereotypes. You know, grubby-looking 17-20 years old people who all know more about computers and science than anyone else older than them. It's very offensive to anyone over 25 watching this film.Speaking of stereotypes, the worst was the portrayal of every adult in this movie except one (Jon Voight's Defense Secretary character, who was fine). Everyone else in any position of authority was made to look stupid and totally idiotic. Filmmakers have been doing this since the '60s. There is no one Liberals despise more than a military figure or someone in the government (if they are Conservative.) Voight must have insisted his role was not going to be like the others. If you doubt this, just check out John Turturro's ""Agent Simmons."" It's ludicrous.The worst - the most insulting of all people in this film - was Sam's mother. In one of her scenes, this woman's dialog might be the most disgustingly-unfunny segments I've ever seen on film and total insult to any viewer with any intelligence. It was at that point, I almost junked the DVD and returned it to the store. However, I hung with it and the last 50 minutes was enjoyable and free of most of that stupidity.I was reminded of one thing: director/writer Michael Bay has a resume of overwrought, intelligence-insulting films like this one. He did ""The Island,"" ""Bad Boys I and II,"" ""Pearl Harbor"" (when the Japanese were made to look like the good guys), ""The Rock,"" etc. Thus, I will be very wary of watching one of his films again or anything written by Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who wrote the screenplay. Then again, I have to admit the action scenes in here were pretty awesome and I really did enjoy the last hour or so. I guess you take the good with the bad.","Oct 10, 2008",6,/10

"There are people who like Michael Bay for his work and others who don't. I only like Bay for certain films and Transformers (2007) is one of them. Because this is the first live action adaptation of the transformers toy line, I am amazed at how well all of it was brought together. Everything from the action, the special effects, the music and the acting.Just like the TV show, transformers involves two sides of alien robots; the autobots (good) and decepticons (bad). Both of which fight for control over each other. This conflict soon brings them to planet Earth where the autobots join forces with the human race. The first human contact (dialog) that the autobots have is with an ordinary individual named Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). Witwicky is like any other young guy; he tries to find a good-looking first car so he can impress the girl of his dreams. The girl of his dreams; Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox). Both LaBeouf and Fox look great together on screen. It is easy to see that they have good chemistry. Along with them are Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson who play two military officers who become one of the first people to experience coming in contact with the ""transformers"". And this happens around the beginning of the film. As for the autobots and decepticons, Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus Prime returns and Hugo Weaving voices the menacing Megatron. Along with others, these voice actors give great performances.The action in this film is exhilarating. Right when things seem like the movie isn't going anywhere, something either blows or lights up to get the audiences' attention. That's where the special effects come in. What amazed me the most about this is that the special effects department made sure that every single component of whatever vehicle the alien robot took form of, was all in the transforming action. Also, the sound itself of the robots transforming was so unique that it is one of those noises that can't be mistaken for something else.The musical score composed by Steve Jablonsky was well executed too. Each track has its own tone and represents each scene accurately. It also has a memorable tune for when Otpimus Prime is on screen and that makes the action that much more entertaining. My only quarrel with the film is LaBeouf's character. If I were in his situation, yes, I would be quite nervous as well but his jitteriness gets tiresome really quickly. I'll partially accept it for now because it's Mr. Witwicky's first time experiencing this kind of unnatural event.Michael Bay's live-action take on the Transformers toys is a blast. The action is explosive and the music is resounding.","Dec 30, 2012",9,/10
"OK I'm rating this movie on the basis of what it is- A sci-fi movie about big robots that can transform into mechanical objects on earth.This is an event movie, a summer blockbuster, a no brains action/comedy film. I will not give this the critical eye of which I might give when reviewing something like the ""English Patient"" or the ""Constant Gardener"". This film is not trying to be anything other than what I described above.So is it any good?! Well yes it is, many elements of the film are extremely well conceived and pulled off.The Cast- Well that was OK, Shia LeBeouf plays the character of Sam Witwicky with charisma, style and competence. I great find for mainstream cinema. The rest of the cast don't have much to do or input into the story. Megan Fox certainly looks stunning, but it stops there, Josh Duhamel provides some slight acting gravitas, but is under-used. Sam's parents played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White both give fantastically likable performances. Overall the casting and performance of the cast was pretty good if not spectacular.The Effects- Well hats of to them, this film is quite the spectacle thanks to those extraordinary CGI robots. All of them good and bad look absolutely amazing. This movie has a Jurrasic park feel to it regarding CGI, you feel that you are witnessing the next step of effects.The Story/Script- OK lets pass on this one, its a let down, not much to it and very weak. I think they certainly could have put a little more effort into this than they obviously did.Direction- Typical Michael Bay, loads of explosions, loads of jumpy camera movements, loads of slow-motion, loads of sunlight, etc etc...... Overall I was satisfied with what he did.Overall- 2 hours of class no brain entertainment, its funny, charming at times, and exceptionally well made. As I'm from the generation that played with the original toys and watched the G1 cartoons I wasn't that disappointed about the changes. So go along, pay your money then sit back and enjoy a fantastic spectacle.******** out of ********** Points lost for poor character arc's and a pretty weak plot and script.

"Despite Michael Bay's numbingly loud and macho direction, he seemed a good fit for presenting this alternate vision based on the 80's toy superstars. Yes, all the trappings of a typical Bay film are present...The pretentious camera-work, embarrassing acting, laughable script, and visual overkill all remain in spades with this spiritual successor to Independence Day, yet somehow the movie remains watchable until the end. Mainly this is due to the unsung heroes of movies like these: the computer animators. Here they are allowed to reach new heights with some outstanding point-of-view renderings as these gigantic robots battle for supremacy. In what is this year's most explosive, debris-laden sequencing, these CGI artist's elevate the formulaic and exploitative idea and turn it into a profound tech demo. While the actual Transformers themselves feel more manipulated into a petty human-based script then what this adaptation should have called for, the presence of lead Shia LaBeouf considerably helps alleviate so much dead weight supplied by the rest of the flesh-based cast.","Oct 12, 2007",6,/10
"""Autobots, Roll Out""When the first Transformers film was released in 2007, I was in fifth grade, and I found it utterly mesmerizing to witness these sleek, gigantic vehicles transforming into talking robots. I wasn't particularly interested nor was I aware of their history, or the slew of animation series or movies that came before, all I cared about were their majestic transformations and some jaw-dropping action sequences that I never envisioned seeing on screen.Despite the extreme hostility that some segments of the viewers have been directing at this set of movies since its inception, the Transformers franchise has always held a special place in my heart. It has been almost sixteen years since its theatrical debut, and I'm still fascinated by it. Even though I have seen the film a dozen times before, it still appears as if I am viewing it for the first time. This never gets old, and it never will.","Jun 7, 2023",9,/10

"This has a decent storyline compared to the rest and the action, cgi and sound effects are all top notch. Watching in 4k with Atmos and it's just amazing. Def worth the watch of this and series for any action fan. Also check out battleship for similar movie.","Apr 10, 2021",8,/10
"Overall, I liked the film, but instead of a 7, this could easily be an 8-8.5. There are so many pointless scenes in this movie that are supposed to be ""developing characters"" but the majority of them are so awful and awkward, you're more wondering why the heck they were included rather than learning about the characters.There are long, extended sequences with Megan Fox and Shia LeBouf that drag on unconscionably long. The sequences with the hackers are abysmal, as well. That whole story arc has almost no bearing on the film, and the most annoying part of it all is that the development of the Transformers was sacrificed in order to develop an abundance of useless characters.Forgiving the plot holes and other weirdness (Why would the Secretary of Defense be constantly addressing the nation in a time of crisis?) the movie's decent.I really wish Bay would have tossed far fewer ""Oh look, nobody noticed the GIANT CG ROBOT IN FRONT OF ME"" sequences and slowed down the robot fighting sequences so you could possibly see what the heck was going on. In nearly every sequence, all you can see is, ""Oh, there's a mass of metal."" If Bay would have cut the hackers, and trimmed the some of the awkward character sequences this would be a fine 1 3/4 hour film with some nicely fleshed out Transformers, with more than 4 lines to differentiate explain why the Autobots were not jerks, and that the Decepticons were.Also, the lips do look weird.","Jul 8, 2007",7,/10

"Transformers Is A 2007 American Science Fiction Action Film Based On The Transformers Toy Line. The film, which Combines Computer Animation with Live Action, is Directed By Michael Bay. with Steven Spielberg Serving As Executive Producer. If You Haven't Had A Good Time With TRANSFORMERS. Then Transforming you to be a fan again in the ""modern"" way will be difficult. If You Haven't Had A Good Time A t The CGI Transformations. then That's just beyond me. Transformers will transform some into fans and already have, its just that good of a movie. This Is Michael Bay's CGI robot Masterpiece! The CGI is Just Awesome, with each unique robot taking up the screen. No Robot Is Lifeless, No Robot Is Boring, No Robot makes you wish it wasn't up there on the big screen ( or little screen ). The Autobot's made me truly believe they aren't so different from us humans, despite they're obvious size and abilities. Both Autobots and Decepticons are cool looking and has enough depth into them which look amazing and sound amazing. The robots are fun and exciting to see. Especially in the FIGHTS.Oh Yes the fights are indeed an ""awe"". Its's those amazingwhirrling transforming gizmos's/ bots fights that really entertain. At first, it was a little hard to tell who was fighting who, but that's been like FOREVER. Now, I can predict like every scene and picture it perfectly. This is a really entertaining movie, with lots of exploding stuff. That's Michael Bay folks! Tanks, Helicopters, Jets, Cars, Cellphones, Trucks, radios, these bots can transform into anything! They can speak our language and they can destroy ! Good versus bad. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Megatron, Starscream, Bone Crusher, every transformer is magic! The transformations are awesome ( as I mentioned ). I liked Optimus Prime's little speeches, they felt important and kind of heartwarming ( if you know what I mean ) The humor was also a success. Loved that blonde ritish speaking women, I found her more good looking than Megan Fox.""I ate the whole plate, the WHOLE plate""""Get Off my Momma's Carpet! She doesn't like NO body on the carpet! Especially POlice!""""You Shoot, I'll Drive!""""I bought A cAR, TURNED OUT TO BE A ALIEN ROBOT. wHO KNEW?""""English dude, English"".All so memorable lines! all of these lines are funny except for the the ""I drive you shoot"" one . That statement wasn't meant to be a funny one. I just wanted to put it out there. The Comedy Smushed into this is very funny. My mom would agree. She laughed out loud at certain jokes. She liked the film.Megan Fox, well I don't have anything to say about her except for ""school hottie"" Michale Bay, do me a favor and don't listen to the negative reviews and stuff, unless you want to but don't let them bring you down into making more movies like this. My rating is a 8.5/10 not a 9. I can't rate decimals in this website unluckily! And I give it a 85/100.","Dec 24, 2014",9,/10
"I saw this movie with my boyfriend and we loved it! There's comedy, romance and action! I am 30 years old and I watched this cartoon when I was a child. When I first heard Optimus Prime introduce himself I was brought back to my childhood. I have 2 brothers and no sisters so some times I had no choice but to ""join them"" because I couldn't ""beat them"". As a little girl I learned to love the same things they did so maybe I am a little different in that, most women might not enjoy this movie but I definitely did! My favorite vehicle (and the one I drive!) the Ford Mustang was in this movie. Chevy lovers definitely will be pleased as well because the Camaro makes a come back and even a Ford lover has to appreciate it. I am now a proud owner of this DVD and would definitely recommend this movie.","Feb 14, 2008",,
"SPOILER: I can't believe the ranking this movie has gotten so far on IMDb. First off the good things: the special effects are great, without a doubt. The comedy in this movie is also great, until it turns to cheese. Shia LeBeouf is great. Unfortunately that's it. The plot is riddled with holes - check out the ""Goofs"" to see just some. There were superfluous characters - Anthony Anderson. Characters were unbelievably weird for no reason - John Tuturro. The soldiers acted absurdly - why would Sergeant Lennox charge the Decepticons with a hand-held weapon when he just called in an air strike. The Transformers went from near indestructible in the beginning of the movie, to Bumblebee getting caught with a net, back to being nearly indestructible (Ironhide at the end battle). Also, I know it's a little more visually pleasing to have the transformers be giants, but how exactly does a camero turn into a two-story robot or Frenzy turning into a boom-box and then a tiny cell phone? And even while the special effects were great, the cinematography was so shaky and close-up that you couldn't even tell what was happening when the Transformers were fighting. Also, I understand that you want to do a little tribute to the original Transformers cartoon and movie, but did ALL the dialog between Optimus and Megatron have to be so cheesy? Michael Bay dropped the ball on this one. In fact, I'm changing my vote to a 5/10, and that's being generous.","Jul 5, 2007",6,/10
"This movies is filled with energy and great action. Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is like liquid gold and Bumblebee is a really funny and good character with lots of attitude. He is probably the only funny thing in this movie. While the action and characters are good the humor is so crude only 12 year olds will find it funny. Everyone else will just groan. Still, you should see this great movie!","Jun 21, 2017",9,/10
"I had high hopes for this movie because of its special effects and Director. What started off as the major motion picture of the summer went to a kids nickelodeon movie right when John Turturro character was introduced. We went from a serious ""24"" type environment to a ridicule all is possible ""go kids"" atmosphere. I grew up watching Transformer on TV and I was hoping for an adaption that captured the fans that are now 30years old not, today's children that don't even know what type vehicle Optimus Prime was. Still I gave it a 7 for its special effects and general nostalgic moments it provided me and my friends in the Theatre but Damn you MICHAEL BAY YOU COULD HAVE MADE A 10/10 MOVIE!!! WHY GO NICKELODEON ON US, WHY??!?!?","Jul 10, 2007",7,/10
"Its exatlaly what you should expect from a Michael Bay Transformers movie - Explosions and Exploitations, and it handels them both very well. Never a boring movie, and has better visuals than most modern movies.","May 5, 2021",8,/10
"Let me just settle this: The first hour of ""Transformers"" is incredible. It's everything you wanted, and more, including humor, acting and special effects that are beyond reason. Michael Bay's take borders on action-comedy, with charming robot slapstick and tons of giggly one-liners taking turns with the hyper-realistic and often brutal action sequences. Shia LaBeouf does a nice job as the human main character, and the cast (including a hilarious guest appearance by Bernie Mac) does an honorable job, without stealing the thunder of the movie's real stars: Optimus Prime and his band of vigilante robots. And again - the effects really are mind-blowing. Fight scenes are messy and sped-up (as seems to be the norm these days), but with the incredible attention to details, such features only enhance that sense of immediacy that carries much of the movie. And although the plot is pretty thin at times, and the clipping strange just as often, it's all nit-picking compared to the massive impression the movie makes.And so all is well until about half an hour is left. The story has been worn pretty thin by then, and without revealing any plot points, it then suffers a deadly blow. The main characters unanimously make a decision that, at least to me, defies any rational thinking, and after a couple hours of swallowing camels, the whole thing suddenly becomes quite hard to accept.This is however nothing when faced with a sudden and extremely bland ending, seemingly rushed together at a tenth of the effort of the rest of the movie - it's like watching the final minutes of Spielberg's ""AI"" all over again. It all sums up extremely off-balance, with a climax that in no way meets the expectations built up by so many excellent moments before it. One can only hope that the sequel rectifies some of that final impression.That being said, ""Transformers"" is a movie well worth both your time and your money, and even a crummy finale cannot overthrow this film's position as action flick number one so far in 2007.","Jul 1, 2007",7,/10

"I'm a person who likes bad movies. I like good movies, too, but I often like the bad ones better. Why is that, silly me? Because they're entertaining. Self-building truck-shaped giant robots from outer space? Searching for some cuboid McGuffin to save the world? Fighting robots, exploding robots, cursing robots, robots urinating motor oil on people? Bring 'em on. But please make sure that I will have a good time with them.Which is exactly what I didn't have with ""Transformers"". Maybe I'm getting too old for the kids' stuff, or I need to adjust my Ritalin level. But watching this was very much unlike watching a popcorn movie, it was more like having my brain replaced by popcorn, by people who happily assume that I don't have much of a brain to begin with.The major problem is not that the movie is so heartbreakingly dumb. (Dumb in a way that makes you slap your head at times). Indeed, some scenes are so inane that the next ""Scary Movie"" film will have a hard time spoofing them (the scene where the two photos are compared -- indescribable; and the Camaro has its own in-built car wash?). The major problem for me was that it was all so annoying. The action pieces were visually uninterpretable, the robots were moving too fast for my poor visual cortex, the explosions didn't stop before the next ones started. It was simply too much for that 35-year-old brain of mine.So even as an audiovisual trip, is it even entertaining? At least not for me. There was no story except for the absolute necessary, the bleached-out skeleton of a plot. There were endless military clichés. There were Jon Voight and John Turturro embarrassing themselves. There was no humor except the unintentional sort (the other one didn't work). The action scenes were undramatic and uninvolving. The love story was generic and flat. Worst: There's real and present danger of a sequel.Looking at the professional reviews on ""Rotten Tomatoes"", I'm surprised that many critics treat this cinematic bomb so tenderly. Maybe it was too expensive to have an independent press?","Aug 6, 2007",,
"Not bad. The special effects were amazing but I think they went a little overboard. There were so many explosions and bullets flying, at times it was hard to see what was going on. This I think, is a function of creating movies on computers. Monitors are sharp and detailed, you're looking at the action on a smaller screen, over and over and frame by frame when it's being created. Then it's unleashed on a big screen and it's just too much to take in at once. Especially with the overwhelming sound. I kept wanting it to slow down for a second so I could see the robots in all their awesome animated glory. But they were too busy shooting at each other and throwing themselves into things (which then disintegrate in a very satisfying manner). Storyline-wise, there wasn't any. But let's face it, it's a popcorn movie with giant robots adapted from a cartoon. You don't go to see a film like that for telling insights into the human condition. I thought the romance between the two main characters was a bit Disney, and the offhand jokes were pretty hokey, but hey, they joined the dots nicely between the explosions. All in all, a good fun film, I'd watch it again - maybe on DVD when it comes out, but I don't think I'll be adding it to my top 10.","Jun 28, 2007",7,/10
"To start with, no film has Ever blown me away in the cinema like this one did! People always go on about the bad parts in films and give it like a one star because they're 'critics'. But this movie was everything you could hope for! I'm one of those sad action and special effects junkies, and this had it all. I used to watch beast wars as a kid so i was expecting transformations like that, not something with 70k parts (i think that's what the extras said anyway), so the first scene had me in love for the rest of the film. This is my first review for a film I think, so it shows how special this is and even the music is amazing! I would 100% recommend, I must have watched it at least 15 times now and its still amazing. Can't wait for the new one!","Feb 3, 2014",10,/10
"A complete messed up movie. I couldn't believe this movie made me sleep. When i usually hear the dialog ""the whole existence of humanity is in your hands"" in any movie, I feel like shouting ""Oh come on! how many times would someone be saving us from extermination!"" Movie has more flaws than its childish dialogs. You would stop counting for flaws just in 10 minutes. I'll feel ashamed even to point out any of them. Sound is even not up to the mark, typical clang clang makes the hand resting on forehead. Only thing Michael Bay is good about is its wasting ""restlessmoney"" on graphics, but all the fighting scenes go in vain of classless camera position, with which you cant understand what is going on. Why doesn't Bay start from the basics of direction and produce a ""good"" movie? I'm afraid even under 10 may like it.Rating on separate aspects: storyline = 3/10 script = 2/10 direction = 0.5/10 sound = 2/10 cinematography = 1/10 art direction = (are you kidding?)complete movie = 1/10 (only for special effects) If Bay turns up somewhere before me, I'm going to ask him to return my money!","Aug 22, 2007",6,/10
"The movie seemed much shorter than it really is because it was constantly moving. There weren't any inappropriate lulls. There was some ""corny"" humor, but definitely not enough to spoil the actual funny parts. Great effects, of course. Shia did a wonderful job as main character, although it seems odd that he becomes so comfortable with the Tranformers presence in his life in such a short amount of time. There's a lot of parts that are totally unreal, but I guess if you're going to see a movie about machines that turn into rational robots, you can't expect too much reality. For those who tend to pick apart movies, there are a lot of unexplained instances throughout the movie that you can mull over later, but all in all, a must see in the movie theaters.","Jul 8, 2007",10,/10
"What you can expect: - incredible action sequences - incredible 5 yard robots doing missile dodging and shooting plasma cannons while changing shape almost constantly.What you won't find: - A serious plot that makes sense somewhere - Optimus prime making monologues that have some connection with what's happening around himSeriously, if you go to see this movie expect a really epic popcorn movie that however has a plot that's as smooth and flawless as an off-road motorbike stunt course and just as mindlessly exciting.This is a movie that will be liked by the same people that will tell you that ""army of darkness"" should deserve an Oscar, and it's like ""army of darkness"" for mindless humor flat out mindless coolness and reeeally bad plot that is just pieces of action sequences sewn together more for ""ok, the audience now needs to take a break here"" than actually trying to make sense at some point.Recommended if you are one of those lucky individuals that can shut your brain before entering the projection room, otherwise you'll probably hate it.","Jun 28, 2007",6,/10

"First of all, a warning to anyone who likes in-depth story lines. This movie's storyline is cheesy and practically non-existent. The bad guys are bad to the point of being overdone, and some of the acting is questionable. That said, you don't really care cause the actions scenes are so hot that it makes you just wanna watch it over and over again. I actually am glad that they kept any real chic-flicky romance out of the film, and focused on the action. And the movie had many funny moments. Well worth the price of admission and then some. If you want to watch a movie that will make you want to yell 'Awesome!' and 'Cool!' at every action scene, see Transformers. It is well worth it.","Jul 25, 2007",7,/10

"Wow, i am really surprised how many people actually hate this movie, i liked it, this movie got me into the transformers franchise.Well I really didn't have any expectations about this movie, i did not know this was based on some toys and the G1 Transformers, i just saw the movie with an open mind and I really enjoyed it, I just wanted an entertaining movie, with robots destroying each other and I wasn't really expecting a good story but I actually liked the story but I wished Michael Bay have explained more about the war of Cybertron or other plot elements of the transformers franchise.Good things- The robots look Amazing, they look so realistic and the effects when they are transforming looks...just wow for that time. Visual Effects were phenomenal...yeah i know Michael Bay loves explosions but I still liked the use of explosions here, the transformations look amazing and to me it feels like the robots are successfully brought to the big screen. Some of the acting, Shia Labeouf does a decent job as the main human character Sam Witwicky but others felt...flat especially Megan Fox, it feels like she is just there to be the love interest of the main character. I liked the story and some of the action scenes. Optimus Prime is bad-ass in this movie.Bad things-Some of the acting sucked(Megan Fox), Besides Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, the other robots feel so underdeveloped that makes me to don't care about some of the robots especially when Spoiler... When Megatron kills Jazz, I thought Jazz was just there to be killed. And also some Decepticons like Bonecrusher( the one Optimus fights in the highway) just pop out, he just appeared. Some sexual jokes in the movie kind of ruined it to me in some parts, especially after I knew this movie was based on toys.Overall it is a good time if you are looking for a fun movie, it's a good popcorn flick, maybe some fans will be disappointed with this movie but I am a transformers fan and I actually liked this movie.","Dec 1, 2012",8,/10
"The US secretary of defence calls together all experts at his disposal to try and decode a signal that will reveal who just wiped out a military base in Qatar in an attempt to hack into the central computer network. Had they known that a small group of survivors had made it out led by Captain Lennox, they would have known that the attack was a helicopter that changed into a robot and used devastating weapons to destroy everything. Meanwhile, back in the US, nobody officially knows anything so the fact that high school student Sam Witwicky believes his second hand car has a mind of its own, gets him nothing but trouble. But could he be a bigger piece in the puzzle than anyone knows?In the middle of a disappointing summer for blockbusters, I must admit that Transformers went from being one I was planning to see, to become yet another film that I had no desire to rush to be disappointed by. However my girlfriend took me along and I suppose it helped that really nothing about the film suggested that I should expect anything from it. With this in mind I found it mildly entertaining in a simple-minded and noisy way, but this is very different from saying it is a ""good"" film.I sort of fall in a strange place in regards viewing the film because technically I should be a massive fan and very touchy over the details. I loved the toys as a child and got the weekly comic until it finished in the UK at issue 300-something but then on the other hand I really have few affectionate memories of them (and all the possessions are gone!). To a point I did think ""well, that's wrong"" here and there but really I didn't care that much. What bothered me more were the countless weaknesses in areas I would associate with storytelling and film-making rather than the details of a fictional race of robots. First I suppose I should give credit to the effects, because this is what the film is all about. They are excellent and they were so convincingly real that I never found myself looking for the joins. The scale of them does mean it all gets a bit frantic at times and too often I lost track of what was happening.Too often though, the action didn't engage because I just didn't really care about the characters  human or not. This problem is nothing that any extra money spent on effects can solve because it comes from the writing, the acting and the total delivery of the film; I am finding it more and more  too many films are doing whatever effects allow them, rather than letting the film dictate the effects to be used. Anyway, the script is full of clunky dialogue and has all the narrative logic of a drunken argument after closing time. It is best not to ask too much about the importance of Witwicky etc because it has all the strength of wet tissue paper, obviously hoping that action will help cover up all the cracks.The dialogue is just as poor and nobody really comes off talking like a normal person. Of course with such a lacklustre collection of performances, it doesn't really matter so much what words they have to say. LaBeouf is so-so while Fox has a good body and a very impressive tan  neither of them would make me see one of her films again but I suppose pretty young actresses will never want for work (well, so long as everything is as tight as it is at age 21 I guess). Duhamel is bland and even Tyrese lacks spark. Voight and Turturro are both weak and seem even worse due to both of them having been much better than this. The voice work from Cullen, Ryan and others is a nice touch and mostly avoids being corny. The actors aren't helped by the messy direction from Bay. On one hand he is delivering a silly comedy, on the other it is an all-out action movie with a budget that could fund a small country. The comedy is more daft than funny and the romance side is just plain dumb. Action is delivered with a typical lack of restraint and lack of understanding for what makes engaging action  so instead we get the usual grand music and sweeping camera shots.Overall then, the film has loads of noise and lots of money right up there on the screen. However it doesn't have a good script, characters, performances, tension, excitement or memorable content. The summer crowd looking for noise, action and nothing else will find their boxes ticked, however those looking for more will find little.","Sep 4, 2007",,
"The first half of the movie is very good. Good action scenes and excellent humor, with Shia Labouf in the spotlight the movie is quite cool! But the second half, especially the last 30 minutes are nonsense action with frantic camera work and the story is ruined. Example: at some point of the movie (atention!spoiler!), when they are in the desert, the secretary of defense (Jon Voight)suggests they should run to the city (director call to have action inside the city)... bad call secretary... duh! Note 8 for the first half and 4 to the second. Bay had already ruined The Island, it could have been ""the movie"" about cloning but like Transformers, has a good start but the second half, he does it again...nonsense action! He should direct video-clips.","Jun 30, 2007",6,/10
"From Director Michael Bay comes the most visually spectacular film of the year. Transformers which takes the summer action movie to a whole new level. While the film is pictorial masterpiece, let it be known this is Michael Bay we're talking about here. There is cheesy dialogue with a quasi-stupid storyline but the entertainment aspect is there from start to finish.Transformers tells the story of Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf), a teenage boy trying to cope and be accepted by his peers. His solution for acceptance comes when his father purchases Sam a car. Little does he know it's ""Bumble Bee"" an Autobot from a distant universe sent to Earth to protect Sam and mankind. From beginning to end, there is non-stop action and we cannot wait for the next explosion.Shia LeBeouf is becoming our new ""it"" boy especially with an earlier breakout this year, Disturbia. Besides being a heartthrob to girls, he is a brilliant up and coming actor. I would even go as far as call him the next Leonardo DiCaprio with his current pretty boy status and talent. He brings a great sense of energy and fun to his role.Megan Fox who plays Mikaela, Sam's love interest and brings the lovely sex-appeal and ""it"" girl status to all the young and older boys who love to see a pretty girl get dirty. I'm afraid that Fox's acting talent is a bit limited and with comparisons to Angelina Jolie, that doesn't spell so much success for her either. I'll take her MAXIM cover shoot any day though.The rest of the cast gives us your fill in the places performances . We have John Turturro, Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson and Tyrese Gibson for all your comic relief, a little bit of drama and all in between. A well put together cast to say the least.""Oscar"" will be pounding on the door for the Visual Effects and Sound teams. They are achievements in the history of cinema and completely revolutionized and set the bar extremely high for next year's of summer blockbusters. I'm very excited to see those teams up for Oscars in February and hopefully walk away with it.An IMAX theater, a big screen, the side of a building; one of these is needed to get the full experience that is Transformers.

"I'm going to keep this short and simple. Michael Bay who remade Miami Vice saying this was not going to be an 80's staged remake did the same thing with the Transformers. All the real fans were expecting it to stick more to the original and why shouldn't they have kept it more to the original?? I think the original fan base aged between there mid twenties and early thirties is an more interesting audience, revenue-wise, then today's kids.The movie is definitely putting all it's hopes on the effects. The storyline is slim, lacking depth.Some specific let downs:Optimus Prime's character is plain old weak in the movie and his knowledge which made him stick out back in the days is has come down to some simple one liners. He did not live up to his role as leader of the Autobots.I could handle Optimus Prime's 2007 make-over because in basis he looked the same. But the whole Predator-look they gave Megatron 2007 -> what the hell were they thinking?!?The faces on the robots were too slick. We're talking about robots people, they should have kept them more mechanical.Transforming from a vehicle or animal seemed to take ages while transforming back to this state was just a matter of milliseconds.Did somebody order an 2 1/2 hour during GM/Mountain Dew/Panasonic/Nokia/Burger King commercial? Did I miss anyone?The only reason I gave this a 6/10 is because the effects were great. But I'm still awaiting the 80's remake who really makes use of these pro's and combines these with a solid storyline, great character buildups andIs this movie going to smash the box offices? Yes! Is this movie pleasing the original fan base? Not by far!Maybe they shouldn't have..","Jun 28, 2007",6,/10

"Transformers is directed by Michael Bay and written by John Rogers, Roberto Orci & Alex Kurtzman. Based on the Transformers toy line the plot sees Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets involved in a war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery. Also involved in the carnage are Megan Fox, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, John Voight & Mark Ryan.With a production budget of around $150 million, Transformers went on to make almost $710 million worldwide. That is some hefty figures, almost as hefty as the mighty Transformer robots that dazzle and wreak mayhem up on the screen. The plot of course is bonkers, but is anyone seriously watching this expecting high end literacy? The out-shot ultimately is Good Robots Versus Bad Robots, with humans either in the way or aiding the Autobots to save mankind. There's been plenty written about the film, both good and bad. From the quite brilliant transforming sequences to the rather staid dialogue; to the wry observations on the world we now find ourselves in, Transformers has got plenty for the critics and film watchers to ponder. As popcorn summer blockbusters go, it's one of the most fun in recent times; and the box office figures tell you that it found a considerably large and appreciative audience.

Your movies are about gun fights, explosions, car chases, the requisite hot chick, product placement and in this case, robots.Your successful peers manage to tie these ingredients together with a thin string of a plot that lasts ninety minutes, just enough to fill us with adrenaline without being boring.Transformers is over two hours along. For intriguing Oscar-worthy dramas that include character development, plot twists, and witty dialog, this is acceptable. For movies about giant robots fighting over a hot chick wielding the latest Nokia, it is not.Not only does Transformers drag for long stretches, but the plot sucks. I can handle bad plots in action movies -in some cases they're encouraged- but not when it drags the movie out unnecessarily and clutters it with awkward moments. I've regrettably compiled a list of things this movie could do without: -Why did the Scorpion robot attack the military in the desert? Granted, it was a good scene, but it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Um... explain? -Was the young black kid simply pandering to the inner-city audience? He was introduced to crack a code, but the code didn't say anything. I don't even know what happened to him at the end, I think he disappeared.-Same with the Australian girl. You already have a hot chick, adding another one only confuses the males in the audience and gives them false hopes of a threesome. Not only was she annoying, I don't know why she was there. Eliminating her out would've cut five minutes from the film.-The scene where boy meets girl: too long and irrelevant. You've shown that he has a crush on her in the classroom scene, and that he's the nerd that needs a car to impress her. That's enough. You don't need him showing up uninvited at a party, as it added seven early, unneeded minutes to the movie. Remember: explosions, robots, hot chicks, product placement. You suck a dialog so don't bother.Furthermore, ""boy lusts girl"" belongs in another movie; like ""Pearl Harbor"", you forget your point. Like the ADD addled audience you target, you suffer from quick jumps from unrelated subjects and the inability to focus for more than five minutes. That's why you make action movies.-Speaking of that scene, remember his friend? The blond kid who hung upside down from the tree? Yeah... him! Why is he in the movie? Don't addle it with unnecessary characters.-How did the glasses show that the cube is in the desert? The glasses were imprinted with the location of the cube when Megatron was frozen in the arctic. Goddamm, that's a confusing plot piece, such a development needs some explanation, like a sentence ""Megatron had followed the Cube to earth... (pause for digestion) but he got off course and crash landed in the Arctic (further pause). THE CUBE WASN'T IN THE ARCTIC, IT'S SOMEWHERE ELSE"" If you clarified that part, you wouldn't even need to try explaining how the cube got to the desert.OK, I hate to nitpick, but you're making Transformers II, I'd really prefer not to have to sit through thirty minutes of pointless back-story in order to see robots battle over a hot chick, turn into cars and explode. Thank you and feel free to call me if you need a consultant, my fees are surprisingly reasonable compared to Hollywood standards.","Jan 2, 2008",6,/10

I saw this title in the theater not knowing what I was in for and I mean that in a good way. This film is a visual master piece! The detail is mind blowing and the action scenes are very intense. It has a very good story and I knew nothing of the original transformers cartoon prior to seeing the movie. Oh and I have to say Meagan Fox is one of the most beautiful women in the spot light right now and she isn't a bad actress. I've watched this title numerous times and every time I see it I'm amazed. It deserves a much better rating then it currently has. In fact when I saw the current rating I had to make sure I was on the right transformers movie. This thing to me deserves an 8.5!,"Dec 4, 2010",,
"Just another typical Michael Bay film. It's pretty much a mishmash of all his previous films, with some impressive FX and a silly story added in. Shia's plot line was the only one I really cared about, up until it merges with all the other ones, and it's too bad that it was cut up by lame stories about soldiers and hackers. The slapstick bit with all the autobots at his house while he's trying to retrieve the glasses was brilliant, and the fun found there was sorely lacking in the rest of the film. The big action scenes weren't all that impressive - mostly due to Bay's ineptitude as a director - even if the Transformers themselves looked great. By the time the final battle rolled around, I just wanted the film to end. A big disappointment, but I was foolish to expect anything else.","Jul 7, 2007",6,/10
"Coming from a girls point of view, I fell in love with the movie Transformers. I could probably list on one hand the amount of actions movies I have seen in my life and the only one I can truly say I enjoyed was transformers. Director Michael Bay did such a wonderful job of making sure the audience felt like they were right there in the action in each of the scenes. I am a huge fan of Shia LaBeouf's and felt like he did an outstanding job of bringing comedy to an action-based movie. Because I enjoyed the movie so much I have actually now started having an interest in the comics involving Transformers. I have to admit, I watch the movie almost once a month and will never stop enjoying it.","Nov 11, 2008",10,/10
"I just finished reading the last comment and I can say with all my heart I think he is completely missing the point. 1. I never liked the cartoon, and I don't think the other 110,000 viewer that gave this movie above 7 points average are all fans of comic books or the cartoon either. 2. This movie is probably for kids around the age of 5-17ish so I doubt they really care too much about where the planes are flying low or high. 3. Its supposed to be cheesy-ish; You want them all too sound like what exactly??? 4. 'After seeing this film, I almost feel like everyone in the movie was a robot' You mean you must be the stupid one and spent all your time and money wasted whining about it! Instead of sitting back, chilling out and enjoying this action packed, outstanding animation and explosions. 5. 'but absolutely ruin the movie for all of us' Speak for yourself egotistical egghead. Every movie ever made will have mistakes. Weather it be the car in LOTR or the star trooper banging his head on a door frame. One thing I can say to you Kev50027 is build a bridge and stop leaving pathetic comments on Christmas Day.","Mar 5, 2008",7,/10

"I watched this again having seen the new movie, and not thinking too highly of the sequel, I found I actually like this one a little better.This is a typical popcorn fun blockbuster, but the human characters and the humor prevent it from being totally mediocre. Unlike Revenge of the Fallen, I didn't really find the characters annoying and I thought the humor was much more fluent (as opposed to forced) in this one.POSITIVES - I like most of the humor in the movie, and I got a few good laughs out of it. The action and special effects sequences are all excellent. Bumblebee is awesome. It sustained my interest throughout, and I liked most of the characters. In fact, none of the characters really made me angry, which is a definite plus because the new one had several annoying characters.NEGATIVES - Ad placements are everywhere. Granted, they're there to pay for special effects, but they are... everywhere in this movie. - Some of the Autobots' dialog was a little corny (especially Optimus Prime) but they're working based on dialog from the cartoons, so I understand. - The plot is pretty silly with everyone trying to get a cube and hiding ancient robots under the Hoover Dam, but, again, the original material is a little silly. - There are also a lot of plot and story logic errors in the movie (a problem carried to the second one) but it didn't make me angry. More like, ""That's just silly."" Overall, I feel the movie is entertaining popcorn fun. Not everything will appeal to everyone, and I felt a little silly at times watching it because I felt the plot, story, and some of the characters were a little goofy. However, it doesn't get to the point where I'm really mad or irritated by the movie. I gave this one a higher rating than Revenge of the Fallen because the sequel has moments which just made me cringe in disgust.6/10 - Recommend for anyone who just wants to sit back, relax, not think too much, and eat some popcorn.","Jul 10, 2009",6,/10

"If you want Transformers then this movie delivers in spades.The CGI, the story, the human characters and of course the robots.If you're a fan of the original cartoon series then you will be a fan of the movie. Some elements from the original story have been changed but that in no way detracts from the movies excitement.From the opening helicopter attack at the airforce base to the final battle in the city the action is unrelentless.I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a love for good old fashioned rumbles. Even the transformation are spectacular. The highlight would have to be Optimus Primes transformation when he is squaring off against Megatron.Shia Lebouf puts heart and soul into his role and makes it believable for the audience. Megan Fox is good eye candy but also had a good role. Anthony Anderson was a little wasted as far as comic relief. John Turturro does a far better job in that department.Overall, I know that many people don't like Michael Bay and what he does with his movies but here, in this movie, his style of direction fits the bill to a tee! Bring on the sequel!","Jan 14, 2008",9,/10
"Transformers is a good popcorn movie, and this first installment is easily the best one in the franchise. It is about cars that can transform into giant alien robots and it works. The plot is very simple to understand. The fight scenes are ok, sometimes you can't really understand whats is going on in the fight but it is enjoyable. Some people complain that the movie focuses on the humans more than in the robots, but the movie is set on earth, differently than the 80s show, that was completly about the robots. If you're going to watch a movie, expect explosions. A lot of them, actually.","Jan 23, 2021",7,/10

"Overblown, clunky sci-fi/action movie about a young high school nerd who has never had the guts to pursue his nubile, popular classmate. He reaches a milestone when he buys his first car, only to discover that the car is actually one of many sophisticated alien robots that have come to Earth to fight a definitive battle against a rival robotic race. Despite having the prestigious Spielberg name attached, the latest project from director Michael Bay is, like most of his previous efforts, swift and flashy but equally hollow and cheesy; loud and annoyingly overlong it grabs your attention with destructive action scenes and high-octane, high-tech gadgetry that move at a breakneck pace, but who cares? An abundance of eye candy can't hide its lame characters, nearly nonexistent plot, and extraordinarily stupid dialogue that lead up to a noisy, video game-like climax. With sloppy direction, a corny script, and visual effects that try but fail to leave you in awe, this one really only works on a no-brainer level. **","Jul 11, 2007",,
"This will be the third or fourth time I have seen the film and I have decided to do a review, without a doubt Shia's performance is notable and Megan is not bad.The film delivers what it promises, the script is acceptable and at least it does not belittle the viewer's intelligence.I am especially critical of the grade and I give it a 6 for not being the genre of film that I like.I have to highlight the fact that the movie has a lot of action from the beginning and without falling into the mistake of many franchises of having to wait until halfway through the movie to see a Transformers, this one focuses on the Transformers and shows them in a very visible from the beginning.Surely for someone who is fond of this genre my grade seems low, I respect itThat is why I say that the first installment of the saga is not bad at all and is very enjoyable!","Jun 24, 2024",6,/10
"When I saw the trailer of the film I thought that Transformers was going to be another silly action movie without a story but I was wrong. It did have a story although it was simple but it was better that way because you can concentrate on the laughs in a few scenes and the ultra cool action.The story was a bit hard to follow but I managed to understand so my advice would be to don't concentrate on the story too much, just sit back and enjoy the amazing action sequences. Most high budget movies always have a very weak or no story-line especially Spider-man 3 which had a paragraph of story but Transformers had about 2 pages. Also Spider-man 3 is probably the most expensive film ever made but there isn't a single thing that looks expensive but Transformers you can see every penny spent in the movie, in fact it looks more expensive than its budget.The actors were not very well known, I haven't seen any of them before except the funny Black guy who ate all the donuts in the police station, he was in the film Kangaroo Jack. I think his name is Anthony Anderson he was the funniest and he never fails to impress. Probably the filmmakers deliberately got actors with low payment because most of the money is gone to the SFX.The Transformers were the best throughout the whole film and there are also small robots that can change into a CD player or even a mobile phone. Overall while I was watching it my eyes were locked on the big screen and I needed to go to the bathroom but I did not go until the film ended because I didn't want to miss a second. A must see especially on the cinema and when the film ended the audience were clapping & cheering. When I left the theatre I was saying to myself WOW! What an awesome & entertaining movie. In my opinion it is the second best film of 2007 the first is the The Simpsons Movie.","Jul 31, 2007",10,/10

The fight scenes are intense and thrilling, with each robot showcasing its unique abilities and fighting style.The film's story is engaging and keeps the audience invested throughout. The characters are well-written and likable, with Shia LaBeouf delivering a standout performance as Sam. The supporting cast, including Megan Fox as Mikaela Banes and Josh Duhamel as Captain Lennox, also do a great job.What sets ""Transformers"" apart from other action films is its heart. The film explores themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the importance of friendship, and does so with a sincerity that is rare in the genre. The emotional moments are earned and add depth to the story and characters.Overall, ""Transformers"" is a thrilling and visually spectacular action extravaganza that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats.

"Transformers is definitely aimed at the kiddies and I feel sorry for them. Their young ears are going to be blown out by the obnoxious volume of this film. Their eyes are going to be blinded by the obnoxious explosions. Transformers is just a very expensive cartoon.For the teens, there are Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox as the next Bogart and Bacall. Actually, they are the next pair of 20 year olds playing 13 year olds. Their ""steamy"" sex scene is when LaBeouf gets Fox to sit on his lap in a car. Being a PG13 film, nothing can happen, of course.A lot has been written about how cool the transformers look. Big deal. Just because someone has fond memories of playing with transformers as a child doesn't excuse the fact that this is a terribly inept movie. Directed by master hack Michael Bay who directs by throwing in as many explosions as he can and padding content that would be interesting for 5 minutes into a 144 minute explosion extravaganza.For those with time they don't want to waste, watch 20 minutes of this garbage and call it good.

"With all the gazillion planets in the galaxy to choose from, the warring Cybertron races of ""Autobots"" (the sort of goodies) and ""Decepticons"" (the sort of baddies) descend on Earth in search of a missing cube. This ""allspark"" - landed on our planet aeons ago and for many years has been unwittingly in the custody of the always competent US military and their ""Section 7"" operatives - currently led by ""Simmons"" (John Turturro). Now it transpires that there is a clue to the location of this gizmo - and that is to be found on the spectacles of the grandfather of ""Sam"" (Shia LaBeouf), only he doesn't know it. The goodies decide to protect him by providing him with one of their number, the ultimate convertible car ""Bumblebee"" but that doesn't actually end up being much use as his bodyguard and soon poor old ""Sam"" and his gal ""Mikaela"" (the startlingly wooden Megan Fox) are embroiled in the action-packed Meccano movie. The star is easy on the eye and has a soupçon of charisma to bring, but otherwise this is just a shockingly derivative series of repetitive fight scenes featuring robots between whom it is almost impossible to distinguish. Their vocals all seem to involve them speaking into the microphone through an old pair of socks, and as it lurches on I gradually found I really couldn't care less whether the red robot beat the black one - you just know this is but the start of a never ending franchise with only two purposes. 1 - to restart the flagging career of Josh Duhamel and 2 - to sell toys, thousands and thousands of toys. Marketing has often been behind some of the most successful movie spin-offs, but somehow this is just a touch more cynical than the rest. The story is weak and the characterisations, such as they are, are about as deep as a hoof print. Plenty of pyrotechnics, though, but at all but 2½ hours long, this is a long old haul.

"Every now and again there comes a movie that you don't expect to like at all and then it goes and surprises you.'Transformers' was a real shock to me as I have never been a follower of the cartoon series and the trailers I had seen didn't do much for me.The simple truth here is that I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to.It is pretty much action all the way here and the movie very rarely let's up.It is perhaps a touch too long but it never really feels as though it drags at any time.The acting is pretty good and Shia LaBeouf does a good job in the lead role as he shows humour and a serious side when he has to.There were a couple of moments when I was worried that things were going to get too cheesy but luckily the action soon kicked in again.Also,there were genuinely funny moments and the film didn't seem to take itself too seriously,that would have been a BIG mistake.The direction is crisp and Michael Bay deserves credit for such an entertaining ride.There will be many people that will turn their noses up at this movie as just a brainless action flick but that does the film an injustice when it is as well done as this.The effects are brilliantly done and I recommend this film to anyone with an open mind.My mind was already made up before I watched it and the film proved me wrong.","Feb 29, 2008",8,/10
"Growing up watching the original cartoons and loving them more than almost anything else, I was really really REALLY hoping not to come out wanting to hit someone, like I did with that waste of time money and hype that was Thunderbirds.... GRRRRRRR... and I can gratefully say I wasn't.Although there was a moment or two where I was very worried that I was... It does take a little while to get going... but once it does ohhhhhhhhhhhh boy!!!! This is a typical Bay film, lots of shaky cam work, which is a bit of a shame really (especially as I was stuck 3 rows from the front!), and some of the acting was a little duff (Mr Leboef was good though I have since decided!), but lets be fair that isn't the reason we went to see it, we went to see some kick ass transformers fighting to take us back to our childhood.... and we got it alright! Prime is awesome and looks great, updated for 2007 but still has the style of days gone by. In fact every one of the transformers is very well done in the same way (Megatron is not as good but still a solid character). And their interactions with each other, with the humans and their enemies is spot on. My advice would be to watch the original film just before you go and see this, or as much of the original series's as you can cram in! The only reason I can't give this 10 out of 10 is that the film, like SOOOOOO many other remakes for the 2000's, is the inclusion of kids again... Leboef was good I'll give him that, but still.... if they had 2hrs of transformers fighting with no storyline (and NO KIDS) I would watch every time! But still a brilliant film, came out bouncing like a 5 yr old and that is the sign of a good film in my books!!!","Jul 31, 2007",9,/10
"I was a massive fan of Transformers as a kid, I remember watching the various tv shows and collecting the toys. So naturally, when I heard that there was going to be a live-action movie based around that property back in 2007, I was really excited to watch it in the theater and I ended up loving the movie. It's also worth noting that this was the first Michael Bay movie I watched in the theater and this was when I was a really dumb kid. Now as an adult, I decided to give this movie a fresh rewatch to see if I still love this movie or if I hate it now as an adult. After this rewatch, I can say that there are a lot of problems with this movie, but there is still a lot of fun to be had with this first live-action Transformers movie.Positives for Transformers (2007):
The main thing that stood out to me about this movie especially since I am someone who as an adult is not really a big Michael Bay fan that he manages to give this movie that Ambilin Entertainment atmosphere with the Transformers. I do appreciate that at least with this movie, the humans characters serve as the point-of-view protagonists as they are experiencing this larger-than-life scenario with the Transformers in this movie. As someone who is now put off by how he tells his stories and portrays his characters, this is one of the few times to where Michael Bay actually put in the effort in making us care about the story and his characters. This movie was my introduction to a lot of people Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Megan Fox, Tyrese Gibson, Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro, Jon Voight and Peter Cullen. I do appreciate that they cast Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime in this movie especially since he was the original voice actor for that character back in the 80s. I loved the CGI for the transformation sequence in this movie and they still hold up to this movie. I also really appreciated the use of practical effects with some of the Transformers in this movie. The movie is also paced extremely well with its 2 hour and 23 minute runtime. And finally, the action sequences in this movie are awesome and honestly that's the one nice thing you can say about any of Michael Bay's movies.Mixed for Transformers (2007):
This is one of those movies to where you love it as a kid, but you start to notice all of the problems as an adult. First off, the main MacGuffin of Sam Witwicky's great great grandfather's glasses doesn't make any sense and I didn't understand how the Autobots and Decepticons know that it has the map to the location of the AllSpark. Some of the human characters in this movie are not all that interesting with the exception of Sam Witwicky played by Shia LaBeouf. They, you have Megan Fox as Mikaela Banes and she's a little bit bland and boring, but I don't think she's not as terrible as people have made her out to be. Honestly, she's only here to serve as the love interest for Sam Witwicky and to look good, but then again that's a common criticism with any of Michael Bay's movies. Nowadays, his way of portraying of female characters looks subtle compared to other people like Sam Levinson. And finally, the first half of this movie is a bit annoying to get through, but thankfully the second half saves this movie from being bad.Negatives for Transformers (2007):
Despite all the praise I give to Michael Bay for his work with this movie, this is still a Michael Bay movie. You have the overly patriotic feeling with the U. S. military in this movie. You also have the overly sexualized female characters and racial stereotypes in this movie. Sam Witwicky's parents are very irritating and there's a point to where I wanted the Autobots to kill them off. The product placement is very annoying in this movie. And finally, the humor can bey very juvenile and annoying in this movie.Overall, Transformers (2007) still manages to be a good movie despite its flaws. This is one of the few movies to where Michael Bay didn't go full-on Bayhem with one of his projects, which sadly cannot be said for almost all of the Transformers sequels that he directed.","Sep 6, 2024",7,/10
"I know many people loved Transformers as in the movie and its history of past shows and movies. I am not one of those people. I am just judging this according to how it was as a film and wasn't too impressed. Here are some reasons why: The acting was borderline horrible to bad. Shia LaBeouf was the only standout in this mess of a movie. He has something very attractive about his personality that makes him perfect for movies. He has the ability to make things so ordinary in a movie work. That shows that he has something special within him. Megan Fox is very attractive too but that doesn't include her personality or acting. She is very beautiful and good looking. Still for how many other bad actresses can you say that about? Rachel Taylor though not quite as good looking fits under this category of good looking bad actresses. Tyrese Gibson and Anthony Anderson are not exactly known for their great acting either. Jon Voight and John Turturro are known for their acting though. Voight has even won a well deserved Oscar. In here though they played worse than Megan Fox. The only thing more disappointing than bad acting from actors is bad acting from good actors. This happened in Transformers which made it so frustrating.The writing in here didn't exactly help the acting though. I can't blame the acting completely because the writing brought it down even more. Some of the plot explanations were horrible in here and so many over used themes and clichés were in here you can't even count how many they appeared. Worst of all was the dialog. Man how bad it was.The special and sound effects were amazing. Unlike the rest of the movie it was top notch. Some of the action sequences were a real spectacle some were a bit overdone though.The director takes responsibility for all of this. To me and to many other people Michael Bay is one the worst movie directors around. He can not direct one serious sequence or scene in a movie. He is just reserved for action if he is used for anything else that movie will be doomed from the start.Anybody who is just looking for pure action you should definitely watch this. If you are expecting the slightest bit of a meaningful movie of some sort of message don't watch this movie. In fact don't even acknowledge it. Transformers has now message at all (no substance) and that is really sad all, it has is a lot of nice effects (all style). I guess people need meaningless trash though.","Apr 24, 2008",4,/10
"I saw the movie yesterday in the theaters, and I was surprised how funny it was. As expected, the movie has brilliant special effects, and a sometimes predictable, but good story. OK, some of the Autobots-Decepticons-dialogs were a bit corny, but not bad after all. Like they said in the movie, I mean Transformers is one hundred times better than Armaggedon, another Michael-Bay-film.I also like the new design of the Transformers, especially Megatron's, and the play of Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, especially the outstanding performance of LaBeouf. I think action fans will be very pleased. Transformers is clearly one of the Year's movie highlights.","Aug 2, 2007",10,/10
"Ground-breaking in its attention to detail as far as effects go and honest in its intentions as a loud and bombastic series of action set pieces, it has a surprisingly fitting aesthetic that both tips its hat to the source material while adapting it for a modern age. However, Transformers '07 is at its core call-back to the blockbusters of the late 90s, where character and development take a back seat to effects and spectacle, making CG the star of the show in place of story and causing the players in this multi-million dollar play-date to range from flat and forgettable to insulting and exploitative.","Sep 13, 2019",7,/10
"Like many others on this forum, I grew up with the Transformers. So understandably, they hold a special place in my heart. Imagine my excitement when I first heard they were announcing a live action flick for my beloved Transformers. Imagine my despair when I heard Michael Bay was on board to direct. Despite my perpetual distrust of Michael Bay's directing abilities, I wanted to cut the guy a break and trust that he would come through with a great movie in Transformers. That confidence came largely due to Steven Spielberg's endorsement of Michael Bay.In the end however, my initial instincts were right. Simply put, the film was a disappointment. Michael Bay's Transformers suffers from the same ailment that all other Michael Bay films suffer from: A lack of character development. A lack of story development. A lack of proper editing. A lack of proper dialogue. An over indulgence in jittery camera work. As in any other prototypical Michael Bay affair. The magnificent effects, the amazing explosions and the ""jitter cam"" are simply hiding the gaping holes within the film...It's complete exclusion of anything coherent. At no point did I feel I was fully invested in either the story or in any of the characters.Shia LaBeouf does an admirable job with Sam. Given the painfully limited capacity in which he is used, Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is affective as well. Meagan Fox is nothing but eye candy, all be it, a very beautiful candy. Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson and company are mere pawns with little purpose. The likes of Jon Voight and John Turturro are sparsely used to forward a plot that is already clinging for dear life. It is a talented cast, if you read some of those names back, but nothing in Transformers is fully fleshed out. Therein lies the problem.Expecting a high end drama or Oscar material from your usual summer ""blockbuster"" release is foolish, I'm very much aware of that. Still, I expect some portion of intelligent thought in my summer blockbusters meals. The kind I could wryly shrug at, all the while, just as easily, admitting it was a lot of fun.For every single ounce of life in me, I cannot fathom how this film is getting rated 9 on 10's or 8 on 10's. Which essentially means, people are putting this utter example of garbage film-making, right up there with the likes of: The Matrix, Star Wars, Alien, Terminator, Gladiator e.t.c. Now that is amazing! When it comes to films like Transformers, I've heard people say ""I didn't even have to use my brain. That's what made it great!"" I can understand this to a degree, watching dramas all the time isn't fun either. But putting your faculties on hold altogether, is simply asking for far too much. Filmmakers like Michael Bay all to often try to peddle ""flash and bangs"" under the guise of ""summer blockbuster"" or ""popcorn films."" While conveniently and completely disregarding mere basic tenants of film-making.Take for example Star Wars. The film that started the whole summer blockbuster tradition, the mother of all popcorn films so to speak. Yet it's still a film that stands head and shoulders above the likes of Transformers. Why you ask. The reason is simple. George Lucas was wise enough to develop a good story and flesh out the characters. If you think about it, films such as Star Wars, Alien and The Matrix take place in an equally preposterous universe. Although, in each instance, their filmmakers decided on creating a believable storyline and believable characters. A skill that Michael Bay, rather unfortunately, is desperately lacking.I've nothing personal against Michael Bay or Transformers. I take no pleasure in giving Transformers a bad score or giving Michael Bay a hard time of it. I do happen to think that there is talent within Bay. He does have a knack for action sequences and all things combustible. Though again, his absolute disregard for everything else hampers the impact of what he has managed to do right.The film isn't without a few positives (few being the operative word). There are some very nice effects on display here. It's obvious that a great deal of care went into creating all the robots. The skill with which the CGI interact with their environments is amazing. The stunt work and pyrotechnics within the film are top notch as well. Though again, with Michael Bay's incessant need to use jittery camera work and disorienting edits, one isn't able to fully appreciate the aesthetics in their full glory.To be honest, I really did want to like this film. God knows I tried my best. I kept holding out for something, but the end credits rolled on and the proverbial fat lady had sung. Very loudly and very badly it would seem. Ultimately, It's a very shoddy and an extremely mishandled piece of film-making. I can put up with the jittery camera movement Bay is so fond of. I can put up with the disorienting edit jobs. I can even put up with the horrible dialogue. What I can't put up with, is a poorly conceived storyline and atrocious character development. Even if it is for a ""blockbuster/popcorn"" film. Michael Bay's Transformers is akin to a huge state of the art luxury cruise liner, all the bells and whistles attached. With a crucial exception. The engine needed to power it.Thumbs Down.NOTE: The critic James Berardinelli at Reelviews.net sums it up quite nicely with a bit more detail. Something that I didn't want to get into on account of spoilers.","Jul 3, 2007",2,/10
"This movie was freaking awesome. I would suggest for anyone to go. It is crazy funny, had a decent storyline and amazing special effects and fight scenes. It was nice to have Michael Bay join with Spielberg to get more of a storyline rather than just action and comedy. It was just flat out awesome.They did a good job of casting as well. LaBeouf was a good fit for a kid that just get freaked out the whole time and added a good level of comedy. I was pretty impressed with Megan Fox too. She is crazy hot, but did a pretty good job with her role as well. It was really amazing to see the special effects of the film. It was hard to tell that it was not real throughout most of it. But that seems to be a Michael Bay specialty. Overall, this movie was really one of my favorite movies in a long time. It has been a while that I walked out of a movie so excited about it that I would have turned right around and watched it again. Seriously, amazing that is all there is to it. For those that don't care to be crazy critical of movies and just want an awesome movie that will grab you with the action and make you laugh throughout, then this is going to be one of your favorites.","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10

"No one could have shot Transformers better than Michael Bay. The franchise is literally created for Bay. There is nothing in Transformers except for large and spectacular scenes. The plot here generally plays almost no role. The first part was probably the best in the franchise, in 2007 it really looked fresh and interesting.","Aug 19, 2021",7,/10
"Score me as one of those who liked it.Went with my 23-year old son, who also liked it.Plot - no plot of any great significance.Dialogue - entertaining, often very funny.The Transformers - faithful to source material, humorous at times but treated with respect.John Turturro - eye rolling over the top scenery chewing. A performance drawn from the Jack Nicholson School of Subtlety.Shia LaBoeuf - going to be a big star. A lot of screen presence.Effects - mucho eye candy extremely well done.Yup.

"this movie is far and away the best visual achievement in any media ever ever ever. It is so unbelievable. Everyone is talking about how Michael Bay went too ""over the top"" with the visual effects. This is ridiculous. That's kind of the point! This movie was not meant to be some epic drama like the Godfather. No. This is like Star Wars, but 30 years better graphics technology. The only reason this movie isn't on Star Wars level was that the script could have been better. Looking back, there were some very corny lines, but in the moment of the action, they just work. I don't know how it didn't win Oscar for best visual, somehow the Golden Compass beat it, which is ridiculous, because the Golden Compass would have to be the best visual of all time to top transformers. I actually haven't seen that movie, but it has ""Eragon"" dreadfulness written all over it in that it will have 10 million new concepts every 5 minutes, no character development whatsoever, which Transformers actually did have, despite what the critics say.This is the kind of movie that has so many dimensions. You'll watch it once, and you focus on the transformers. The next time you'll notice more things about Sam and Mikaela, then the next time you'll focus on the Army officers, then it'll be the Pentagon lady with the accent. Their characters are actually far more complex than you notice at first, because you're so zoned in on all the action. ""Bring the rain"" is now my favorite line of all time. This movie is so amazing you must see it i can't even tell you how much you need to see it. Even the drama-loving, detail-focused, picky critics will be awed by the action, despite what they will say about it's other ""flaws"" (i swear the script is the only one). This movie has something for everyone, and if you play COD4, R6V, or some other game like that then you'll really appreciate the weapons used in this movie.Please see this movie, it should really get like 9.5 stars, because 10 is perfect, and the script could have been better, but really, it works in the moment, and there are some really great lines, mixed in with some bad ones.This movie should have won, maybe 5 or 6 Oscars, and it probably would have if the critics had watched the movie 4 times, but they only saw it once, and only saw the action, thus, it wins no Oscars. I cannot stress enough how you need to see this movie more than once to appreciate it beyond its special effects, which are the greatest part about the movie, but you really should see it again, it just kind of all fits, it's kind of all wrapped up nicely. It's like a great book, everything just works.Lastly i would like to comment on the use of lines/scenes/shots/ideas from other movies used in this movie. Transformers does use lots of that, such as the fighter pilot scene from Independence Day, the Bunker scene from Terminator 3, and there's more, but the thing is, these are great scenes/ideas/etc. that Michael Bay borrows, so it is actually a good thing.Cannot say enough about this movie, you need to go see it, even if you don't speak English, it's worth seeing.","May 30, 2008",10,/10
"This is a great introduction to the series, bringing all of the favourites to the big screen and live action for everyone, but especially the eighties generation to enjoy. I have to admit that I only really remember Optimus Prime from those days, but I know I loved the series regardless.It's an interesting story, although it does take a while to really get in to it.It was a good choice to use humour and romance to break up what could have just been a film about fighting robots and full of explosions. In that respect I feel that the casting was appropriate and although he can only ever play himself, I feel sorry for the flack that Shia gets. I imagine that he had a tough childhood, being a celebrity from such an early age. In this role he is perfect.As for Megan Fox, she could have been played by anyone for all that I care. I don't think that she specifically added anything to the film apart from the lusting audience of teenage boys that flocked to the cinema over and over again so that they could unzip there trousers in the dark.The special effects including the Autobots themselves are done very well. There is never a moment where you might doubt that they are real. They do move so fast it's hard to see anything at all sometimes though.It's a typical action/adventure made to be enjoyed by young males from 12 up and you can expect all of the elements that go in to a film like that, but it's done well.","Apr 4, 2021",6,/10

"What a fantastic film! That's the first thing I thought when the credits rolled up. I saw this only on TV a while back on one of the digital channels. This was much better than the terrible sequel because the film was a new idea with a fresh plot, the special effects were excellent and I loved the car transforming into the robots and back again. Shia LaBeouf's performance was great with decent support from Jon Voight and Megan Fox who played the loved interest. It was also very funny and not childish like the second and the camera-work wasn't all over the place. I will always like this first film, which Michael Bay has done well with but not the second. Yes this film is long but it holds your interest because it's new but the second was just repetitive.","Jun 29, 2011",8,/10
"First of all I am huge Transformer fan,when I was a kid I watched the cartoon and the original animated movie(which I also love)A lot of so called fans have made comments on how their not happy,I don't see how this can be.This film brings Transformers to life in every sense,it is visually stunning and the original personalities of the robots has been captured perfectly with added gusto.Yes, changes have been made but these were necessary and only enhanced the story, the human characters were actually good for once and were extremely funny.The story is perfect for a blockbuster film, the direction by Bay is by far his best(this is his best film)and for once I am actually looking forward to a sequel.The newcomer will be blown away by the effects and really care about the noble Autobots, the fan will have their dreams fulfilled.This is also the biggest action movie ever made nothing even comes close.I'm in Australia so I saw the film before my American buddies,so please believe me,see this movie if your a newcomer(you will love it) and to the Transformer fans you must see this film,even the line ""One shall stand and one shall fall"" is spoken by Prime and if your a true fan be prepared, you may get emotional.","Jun 27, 2007",,
"One of the standout aspects of Transformers is the stunning visual effects. The seamless integration of CGI and live-action elements brings the iconic Autobots and Decepticons to life in a way that is sure to please fans. The attention to detail in the robot designs and the dynamic action sequences showcase the immense effort put into the film's production.The cast, led by Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, delivers commendable performances. LaBeouf brings his trademark charm and humor to the role, providing a relatable and likable protagonist. The supporting cast, including Megan Fox as Mikaela Banes and Josh Duhamel as Captain Lennox, adds depth and charisma to the story, making the human characters more engaging amidst the chaos.Transformers succeeds in capturing the essence of the original series and the nostalgia associated with it. The inclusion of iconic Transformers, such as Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, will undoubtedly satisfy long-time fans. The film also manages to balance its serious and humorous moments, infusing lightheartedness into the intense action sequences.However, the film falls short in a few areas. The script, at times, lacks depth and relies heavily on clichéd dialogue and predictable plot points. The focus on the human characters sometimes detracts from the Transformers themselves, leaving fans craving more robot-centric storytelling. Additionally, the runtime feels unnecessarily long, resulting in pacing issues that could have been better managed.Despite these shortcomings, Transformers is an enjoyable ride that provides a dose of nostalgia and exhilarating action. The impressive visuals, solid performances, and faithfulness to the source material make it a worthy adaptation for fans of the franchise. While it may not be a groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece, it offers a fun and entertaining experience that is worth checking out, especially for those seeking a dose of robot-driven excitement.In conclusion, Transformers (2007) earns a solid 7 out of 10 rating. It delivers on its promise of explosive action and nostalgia, even though it falls short in certain areas. Grab some popcorn, buckle up, and get ready for a thrilling adventure with the Autobots and Decepticons.","Jul 4, 2023",7,/10
"This movie does not disappoint! Bravo Michael Bay...another masterpiece. We waited a long time for a new Independence Day! I was sitting on the edge of my seat completely swept away by the spectacle and awe of the magical special effects. This movie is appropriate for all age groups young and old. No sex and the violence is acceptable considering the save the world theme. If you liked Independence Day than definitely go an see this. It is even better! If you are a special effects junkie, you will want a Hasbro Transformer after seeking this movie!I will see it again!","Jul 7, 2007",10,/10
"These movies aren't the best movies in the world they have weird cuts for example one when they just got in the car with sector seven, right after the autobots come, they have this cut where it was clearly supposed to be one shot before the other. So, there are some certain parts the editors messed up on but these movies are fun, and entertaining because I mean in 2007 they way they looked was just amazing and still hold up today better then a lot of other movies. If you've never seen any transformers then you're missing out. You'll watch it and go yeah that was fun I wouldn't mind watching that again.","Aug 10, 2021",7,/10
"I'm 26 - one of the lucky people who got to grow up with the animated series, and once upon a time used to drive a plastic Optimus Prime around, and as a fan of the original, I must say I love this movie. It's everything I expected and some more.""Transformers"" is probably the best cartoon-to-movie adaption I've seen so far. It's funny, with underlying seriousness, and honors the old animés. The actors work for me, and I won't say anything more about them, 'cause lets face it - this is not the movie to watch for the sake of human actors. (A regal curtsy to Shia LeBeouf, though, for his great interacting with the robots.) The robots, on the other hand, I could go on and on about. (Don't worry, I won't.) They look simply awesome. This is CG at its best; balanced and believable. From the moment Blackout started shooting things up and on, I sat with a happy grin on my face, that only got wider towards the end.The voices are better than I imagined. Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime will forever stand alongside sir Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan Kenobi in my memory, as two actors who managed to pull off some, at times, very difficult, bordering ridiculous dialog. Hugo Weaving is superb as Megatron, and makes the Decepticon leader the menacing madman he is. His ""You've failed me yet again, Starscream"" was music to my ears. As a hardcore fan of the animés, perhaps I haven't been very critical about this movie, but I don't want to be either, because this IS Transformers.","Jul 24, 2007",8,/10
"Transformers is the one that started them all back in 2007, a massive live-action movie based on the cartoon from the 1980's that so many children watched growing up. This Michael Bay film stars Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, the every-teenager in the film and the link between the humans and the Autobots in the movies as well. His sidekick and love interest in the film is well played by Megan Fox, as she plays Mikaela Banes, popular girl at the school that Witwicky eventually wins over and the pair eventually teams up to win over the Autobots to help them on their quest against the evil Decepticons. Like with the cartoon of the 1980's, the Decepticons are led by Megatron as he goes head-to-head against Autobot leader Optimus Prime for the allspark, an ultimate power source that - in the wrong hands - could cause certain death to the entire human race. Transformers is very well done by Bay, in fact none of the Transformers live-action movies are poorly made. One of the nice things about the movie franchise is that the transformers themselves get more and more realistic looking as the movie line progresses. Chalk it up to technology in my book, there just seems to be a crisper and tighter picture with each movie as time progresses. Nice performances by Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and Jon Voight add good human element to the movie. It's a great movie for people of all ages, its fun for the young who might just like the transformers and fun for more mature audiences that may like the drama and humor of the human actors. Transformers, the movie this time, also has a great live soundtrack to it, going back to the days of of movies like Batman Forever where soundtracks by popular bands supplemented great summer movie releases. Great story, great directing, good writing, good acting, great special effects, good sound track, and a great sense of fun make this a good movie to see!! 7 out of 10 stars!!","Mar 9, 2023",7,/10
"This movie is very BAD, but I bet you're gonna watch it anyways This has to be the most disappointing movie I've watched this year. What a let down! It's probably up there with great franchise flops like Dungeon & Dragons (which was really really bad) and Terminator 3 which was nowhere close to the very much dated T1 & T2.Sure, I understand this Transformers is a Michael Bay Transformers (made 2007 and not 1980s) it shd be different .yes yes but almost everything lacked character!I guess what I wanna say is a good movie is timeless. It tells a good story and leaves deep impression in the audience. 50 years from now, you may tell people about an excellent movie you've watched in 2007, but it's probably NOT Transformers.If you are a 5-year old kid, you may like the movie. If you are an adult with no great expectations, you may find it visually entertaining. If you are a Transformers fan I suggest not watching it cos it may spoil your day, as it did with mine. But you probably are gonna watch it anyways as I did cos it's TRANSFORMERS tsk tsk ☹","Jun 28, 2007",1,/10
"Now, i do not consider myself to be a big Transformers fan. The show was before my time, and the animation a little dated. However, when i heard that the Transformers were going to be projected onto the big screen; i was greatly intrigued. I wasn't disappointed with what i saw.The basic plot is there is a war between the Autobots (good guys), and the Deceptacons (bad guys). Megatron, the leader of the Deceptacons has been frozen on Earth, and is in captivity. A cube of energy known as the Allspark, which has landed on Earth, and along with Megatron is also held by the American Government. The Allspark has the ability to turn any machine into a transformer. However, Megatron wants the Allspark in order to create an army of Deceptacons and rule the Earth. Luckily the Autobots lead by Optimus Prime intend on preventing Megatron from succeeding, and attempt to destroy the Allspark.The plot is strong, and is able to keep an audience entertained for the duration, although the sub-plotted love story, although expected is a little clichéd and predictable.The script is well written, with a number of witty jokes and genuine laugh out loud moments. However, it was my greatest disappointment to see such little dialect between the Transformers, and especially the Deceptacons. However, perhaps the character developments are being saved until the sequels.The acting is of a good standard, although i found Shia Le Boeuf to outshine the rest. He's come a long way from Even Stevens.The CGI is faultless, and the transformations are slick and intricate, and the Transformers themselves look fantastically lifelike.In conclusion, a throughly enjoyable movie with enough explosions to keep the adrenaline junkies on the edge of their seats, whilst retaining a clever script to keep everyone else entertained. This movie can appeal to young and old, and it is certainly a surprise to see Michael Bay make a decent movie for once. I only hope he doesn't ruin the good work with the sequels.","Jul 26, 2007",8,/10
"I still remember the feeling of watching this movie for the first time. It is very great. Every boy has that feeling and the CGI brought it out clearly and completely. The feeling of witnessing a giant robot transforming, with the sounds of machines colliding as they move, is truly thrilling in a joyful way. The story about Sam is also quite simple. A foolish boy gradually becomes a brave protagonist who saves the earth and gets a beautiful girlfriend. Everything is a bit like comic style. But it's convincing enough to watch and enjoy. I quite like the music and sound editing. If you are a boy, you should watch this movie at least once lol.","Jun 2, 2024",7,/10

"Alright so there's a lot of hype. And in Hollywood, Hype is almost never good.... well this time we're wrong! Transformers is perhaps the most intriguingly visually appealing film released since the original Jurassic Park, plus the amazing star cast have sparks whenever acting together which makes special effects of its own.Okay let's start from the beginning. I walked into Transformers with my sister thinking ""wow this is gonna be weak"". When my eyes adjusted to the darkness I realized how hard it was to find a seat. Once we finally did settle down I got to see four boring previews (except for Die Hard which is the best of it's lot). Then the movie started... and I was hooked. The sound is almost as sexy as the movie itself. You seriously feel like you're in the world's greatest Roller coaster ride throughout the movie. Shiloh Boueff is Hilarious, and the chick is so Beautiful. Like seriously, I fell in love. Tyrese and the other Soldier have amazing comedy chemistry together in even the worst situations (when u see it remember ""cell phone in Iraq""). But the gorgeous, most amazing, beautifully rendered characters have got to be the Transformers. My goodness, are they real? Did they really tear that city apart? were they really falling through a moving freeway? Did the Scorpion Trans really come out of the sand like that and snap that dude in half? wow it looked so real. So real, that you'll be looking at your car in a completely different angle.Michael Bay has always been an amazing director, but this time he cut through my heart. This movie is the best movie I've seen in a long time... I'm going to have to even say it's better than 300... yeah it's that good. When you go see it do not expect a kids movie... there's a lot of sexual references and the two hot lead women (a Analyst with the sexiest accent ever, and the who Shiloh sweats) Jesus Jessica Alba move aside. Meagan Fox is my new dream.But yes. Of all the films out right now (excluding Rattotioue cause I haven't' seen it) This movie holds the crown. Die Hard is tight... but not even close to the intensity of this movie. 1408 is scary, but not as scary as a Megatron... I love this movie, so much that I even went out and bought the game, an action figure, and I'm gonna reserve the DVD. Transformers is the best movie out this whole year. Go see it, and i guarantee you will never forget it.","Jul 7, 2007",10,/10
"I never really understood the fascination with Transformer toys. I always thought they were kinda stupid the way they transformed into inane things like cars, boom boxes, and ugh.. dinosaurs. I have friends that love them... but even they could not make me sit though the 80s cartoon movie. Never was a fan.So, in my inbox pops the invite from this same pack of friends to their outing to see the Transformers movie. I was not interested and declined this particular fanboy cinemaplex Pilgrimage but the next invitation was not so easy to decline, my kids asked me... repeatedly... to take them. I finally relented as I have sat through everything from Chicken Little to The Santa Clause so why not Transformers? After all, I am a veteran of sitting through crappy kids movies.The next 2.5 hours would be a blur of unanticipated cinematic goodness. As much as I love the Spiderman franchise and counted the days until SM3, there were times during that movie that I wanted to hang myself from the nearest thing that would be high enough to hang myself from. This movie on the other hand had me wanting more... 2.5 hours can seem like half that amount of time when a movie succeeds in captivating you like this one does. The movie moves along at a good clip with action to spare, very good acting, and even a decent storyline thrown in for good measure.There are some parallels you can draw between this movie and Independence Day. ID4 was a good movie but it didn't grab ahold of me and refuse to let go like this one did. This movie is perhaps one of the finest action movies made... finally, an action movie with style AND substance.If you don't like this movie, then check your pulse my friend because you are probably dead.","Jul 5, 2007",,
"""Transformers"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch an ancient fight between two Cybertronian races, the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons. They both come to Earth because their fate and their power are held by a teenager who does not know anything about it.I liked this movie because as a fan of Transformers I found it very good and interesting since it was consisted of plenty of action and very good visual effects. The direction which was made by Michael Bay was good but a bit dark for me. I have to say that if you are a fan of Transformers then I am definitely sure that not only you will enjoy this movie but that you will love it. I highly recommend everyone to watch it because even if you are not a fan of Transformers, you will have a great time.","Aug 3, 2020",7,/10

"Give Michael Bay a budget and he'll spend it. Wisely or not is up for debate. But damn, the man-child that he truly is certainly is presented through his mind-numbing work. Enough pyrotechnics to annihilate an entire nation and an adequate amount of Megan Fox showcasing to transition into the adult entertainment business. So, Transformers. A franchise decimated by needless, unimaginative sequels that tarnished the reputation of the primary instalment. Also known as, the only decent entry Bay ever conceived. A group of Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, sent to Earth to prevent the Decepticons from reviving the antagonistic Megatron and retrieving an extraterrestrial cube.This blockbuster opposes everything I stand for as an amateur critic, film buff and general human being. Its bombastic nihilism, riddled with blatant exposition, surmounts to an unquantifiable splurge of stuff happening onscreen. Seriously. It's the equivalent of being lobotomised and watching a sunset from a stained glass window. The colours, brightness and artificial heat would melt your retinas. That's Transformers.But what people seemingly forget, especially those elitists too afraid to breach admittance, is that Bay's first foray into the franchise is actually tolerable. Good, even. And by that, I don't mean it's the epitome of blockbusting entertainment. Far from it. Yet Bay, a director incredibly easy to pick on due to his accessibly basic yet overly explosive features, implants genuine directorial talent that prove his integrity. Yes, about an hour of the film's runtime is explosive, with buildings toppling and metallic vehicular warfare ensuing.However, what makes Transformers utterly re-watchable is the constant flow of its narrative. It never stagnates. For over two hours, Bay continually pushes the story forward. Whether it be sweaty soldiers exhuming mountains of testosterone, sweaty LaBeouf clamming up or sweaty Fox suggestively leaning over the hood of a car (realising Bay's wet dream...), it doesn't matter. The point is, there's never a dull moment through the frantic action. A commendable quality that provides motion to the narrative's mechanisms. Bay knows how to exploit a budget. You go big, or you go home. He clearly understood that literally.Another reason as to why the first chapter is one of his best films, is the simplistic story. The actual plot is thin, with a couple of robots stopping some other robots from destroying everything. Basic foundations without convoluted lore that is constructed as if the writers are formulating random ideas as they're writing the script (*cough* Revenge of the Fallen...). Yet what furthers the script's memorability is the humorous characterisation. The Witwicky clan in particular. LaBeouf delivered a frenetic performance that solidified his leading qualities (which may have backfired on him!). His adolescent antics and heroic endeavours forced him to be both relatable and likeable. Fox, despite being presented on a suspiciously stained silver platter, held her own as well without resorting to the typical ""damsel in distress"" scenario. Supporting cast were buoyant also. The governmental world ending plot merged well with the teen angst situation, even if it was a colossal convenience. And a plethora of memorable quotes that I unknowingly recite on a daily basis. ""Shut up Grandma! Drink your prune juice!"". Classic.It teeters on mediocrity at the best of times, however Bay's focus on the human elements for the vast majority of the first hour ensured that it was more than just mechanical beings punching each other to fluctuating bass drops. There is substance before the clunky visual and auditory extravaganza. Did I grow up with the original source material? Of course not. Regardless though, I think we all need reminding just how solid this blockbuster really is. ""Autobots! Roll out!"".","Oct 6, 2019",6,/10
"Or even the summer as another reviewer stated! But before I start the review, I have to say/admit, that I don't or better didn't know much about the Transformers world, before I went out to watch the movie. So I can't tell you any differences between the movie and the series or if they forgot/missed something, reinvented the Transformers or anything like that.What I can tell you, is that this movie delivers exactly what it promises. Fun, action, cars and a hot woman. Is there anything else a movie needs? An actual plot you say? Seriously though, if you're going into this movie, than should know better than that. I checked some of Mr. Bays favorite things above ... a few others are: the always moving camera if an action scene is played out in front of you. The spinning camera around the hero(es) etc. etc. etc.The actors are great too (for a blockbuster), Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox! Some characters come short (come to think of it most of them) due to the amount of time spent on the action and/or comedy scenes in the movie, but that's OK. OK because it's what you can expect. So shut down your brain at the entrance and enjoy this ride. It's worth it (and I'm definitely nothing close to a Bay nor a Bruckheimer fan)!","Oct 10, 2007",8,/10
"LaBeouf plays a decent lead character in this film, as he and others get blown away by an almost-unstoppable alien species, the good side known as the Autobots and the evil side as the Decepticons. Optimist prime and Peter Cullen go arguably well together creating a bold and well known Autobot that fans can really look up to. I never played the toys much when I was younger, but people told me these movies were decent. I can certainly agree in many aspects, but overall, the series as a whole is not all that well made. But on a more positive side though, this first installment is probably the best out of the ones that are out so far. I will also admit too that even though each of the films are a bit poorly made in reality, I still enjoy the thrill of watching them all as they are one of my favorite types of intense action films just to sit back to. Kudos to the jaw-dropping visuals as well.","Nov 8, 2022",7,/10
"I'm a transformer fan, not fanatic  to save you any time reading, I suggest you pass on seeing this in the theaters, wait for it on OnDemand or DVD. If you DO go to see it in the theater, be prepared to not be on the edge of your seat for about half the film. The film exhibits either one of two classic Hollywood film making errors. Either there was a lot of story in the writer's heads that didn't make it to the screen OR too many cooks were throwing all sorts of 'trendy' ingredients into the soup spoiling the meal.Here are some basic notes; The numerous subplots were SO inconsequential, poorly acted, cast, and edited - all conspired to slow down the film. It felt like a committee decided they need to fill the time between the special effects with a cute girl 'scientist' (with a heavy Aussie accent no less), Hip Hop computer hackers, teenage angst and crazy men in Black. (the kids are going to LOVE the zany Defense Secretary!)  The romantic tension between the two lead characters (the human ones) was cliché and padded the film with useless scenes that didn't move the story. A degree of this is to be expected but it's so poorly managed here that it only adds more speed bumps to the script.  As mentioned already by others, the action scenes use the ""shake the camera"" technique to both mask the effects and make it feel 'real'. Man this was irritating as hell, it made me wish the scenes (that I came to see) would just end.  The fights were so chaotic that generally you didn't know what was happening until it was over and even then you don't get a good sense for how it went down. I'm not sure if it was the print we watched but the film itself shifted between good quality to super grainy, and it wasn't being done for effect, it was like they used the wrong speed of film when they shot it.I really wanted to like this film but sadly the more I think about it, the worse it gets. If they do a sequel (and that seems inevitable) I hope it's darker and better written.--------Post First Week Box office note: I'm glad the film did well, I REALLY hope the sequel comes back darker and allows the Transformer Characters be more the story and not this 'Independence Day' style of disaster flick.Maybe get Ronald Moore or the team from Batman Begins to write it.","Jul 6, 2007",4,/10
"I can't fit all the pros on this review so i'll tell you that this movie is awesome due to great visuals, great acting, and great sound. The cgi looks real and I can't think of a movie with better visuals than this one. The sound is perfect and the acting is mediocre. Now for cons: too much drama and too much attention is put on the love story...especially a movie based on a story about war! One example that bothered me was Sam and Makala holding hands and talking in the middle of crossfire! They are trying to stay alive and not die. What was Michal Bay thinking? That is so unreal. Love in the middle of a battle when Brawl is bombarding soldiers. Wow! Anyway these cons shouldn't stop you from watching it. So remember I am giving it a nine out of ten.","Jul 17, 2010",9,/10

"Yes, I loved Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, but Steven Spielberg is the executive producers of garbage flicks like War of the Worlds and AI, both testimonials to lavish over-budgeting and plot less rambling in scriptwriting. Well, I guess he put Michael Bay in front of this over-bloated silly mess, Transformers, so that he could be the crap shield.This movie is the war sequence we wanted but were denied in War of the Worlds, played in over-sized, out-of-focus for the most part, and boringly-repeated fashion, between the ""good"" Autobots and the ""evil"" Decepticons who are after a source of unlimited power that landed on Earth thousands of years ago, and discovered by the grandfather of soon- to-be-metro-sexual-wimp Sam Witwicky, played by Shia LaBeouf. Apparently the map of the location of this ""Allspark"" is etched on his grandfather's glasses, which he possesses.At any rate, through twist of fate, Sam obtains a car, which is an Autobot in disguise, and picks up a jock-chasing chick Mikaela Banes, played by Megan Fox. From that point on, the movie is a mindless array of action sequences as the Decepticons make their way to Earth and attempt to cripple all defense and communications prior to a battle with the Autobots.My main problem with this film is that it spends virtually all its time in overblown (and out of screen scope) CGI action sequences that are either too close up to fully comprehend or almost too fast to make any sense of. John Voight is wasted in the role of the Secretary of Defense, choosing to take the paycheck and act like a slightly-intellectual hard-headed redneck bureaucrat instead of playing an interesting character.The rest of the performances by cast are really unmemorable, and the action sequences are just a jumbled mess. The other annoying aspect of this film is that it is a virtual commercial for Chevrolet, Taco Bell, and every other kind of franchise item (candy, tools, and cars), and the actors use their names with great repetition. I have to assume that the executive producer of this film (no stranger of cliché ad usage, remember Reese's Pieces in E.T.?) was banking on merchandising revenues if the film failed at the box office.In the end, it is another brainless, mindless thrill ride we expect from Spielberg. Thank God he has Michael Bay to point the finger of blame should this thing fail. This movie has the indelible mark of the ultimate King of Cinema Crap, Steven Spielberg, and has a similar feel of his ""epic"" action films.I would not even bother renting this one. It really is not worth the viewers time.","Jul 3, 2007",1,/10

"I used to love Transformers as a kid. The cartoons were great and I loved the toys. But then a few years ago I got the toys out of my loft. Bloody hell they were crap. Cheap, flimsy and poorly made. How could I have been so wrong? How could something so awesome secretly be a pile of toss? Well, I guess children are both stupid and easily impressed.But I guess that assessment must be extended to a lot of teenagers and young adults, as a lot of people are saying that Transformers is a good film. Well, it's not. It's a horrendous example of film-making. The action is dull and uninvolving, the characters are annoying as hell and the writing and the acting are risible. What an atrocious piece of crap.That being said, the special effects are pretty good. But why would anyone want to watch a film just because it has some nice graphics? And anyway, even though the Transformers themselves are impressively rendered, you rarely get a chance to look at them properly. The camera never lingers on them, so you only get glimpses. Therefore there's no sense of awe. They never take your breath away like the space station did in 2001 or the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. They just look...nice.But unfortunately they don't sound very good. Yes I can imagine it must be pretty damn difficult to think of dialogue for alien robots, but the stuff here is just painful. 'My name is Optimus Prime, we are autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron.' 'You still fight for the weak! That is why you lose!' 'Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.' Just awful.Not that I was expecting Kafka from this film. But it would be nice to watch the film without having to cringe every five seconds. The dialogue here isn't even serviceable. It's floating about in the toilet. And the plot itself is almost incomprehensible. Okay, so a big cube thing lands on Earth and the robots want it and, er... Yeah, I've lost the will to live. I'm sure the film explains it all in its dim-witted way, but the movie is so restless, so eager to move onto the next explosion or next joke that everything just washes over you like a tide of effluent.But what about the characters? Okay, so even if the writing and the direction are pants, maybe the characters can save it. Er, no. Nearly all the people here just made me want to kill them. Whether it be Jon Voight as the Defence Secretary, the fat black guy who's mouthy but a genius, the blonde Australian bimbo, the army guys, the Transformers themselves or Megan Fox's airhead heroine. The only people who don't totally humiliate themselves are John Turturro (who's always fun), Bernie Mac (who's gets to be an amusing jerk for about ten seconds) and Shia LaBeouf (who's passable as the film's hero). Everyone else though can go to hell.And Megan Fox can go there first. She's got great legs and a flat stomach that I'm sure loads of men are dribbling over, but she seems barely sentient. She has no charisma, no screen presence and no ability as an actress. She's a dull fantasy for teenagers and men with no taste. I mean, there's a scene where she looks under the bonnet of a car and tells the panting LaBeouf what's wrong. Maybe I'm asking too much in wanting believability in a film about alien robots, but I can barely believe that Fox knows how to open a door let alone know her way around an automobile.But now that I think about it, there is something worse than Megan Fox  the annoying little Decepticon robot that runs around. It's meant to be a Puckish figure. A cheeky little rapscallion. But every time it was on screen, which was often, I wanted to rip Michael Bay's arm off and slap him in the face with it. This little robot is one of the most irritating screen presences I've ever seen. I'd rather have five hundred Bette Midlers dancing around. They'd infuriate me less.And is it just me or is there the whiff or something unsavoury in the way that the Decepticons (minus Megatron) all speak an alien foreign language and want to destroy the world and the way that the Autobots all speak perfect English and want to protect it? Take this robotic bitch-slapping surrogate Muslim fundies! But how to explain Megatron speaking English? Maybe he was the smart one that was sent overseas to learn a proper civilised language. And then something went wrong in his brain circuits and he turned loopy.But this would give the film too much credit. Transformers is really just all about building up to one large robot face-off. Too bad, then, that the final sequence is a snoozefest. Part of the reason for this is because we don't care a jot about the characters and their fates, but it's also because the direction is so poor. We rarely get to see what's going on. Indeed, half the time it's hard to know which side the robots are fighting for. Is that big thing an Autobot or a Decepticon? At least in the cartoons you had helpful logos on the characters to tell you who was who. But here you're screwed. Yeah, you might be able to recognise Optimus Prime and Megatron (maybe even Bumblebee, seeing as he's actually given screen time), but the others are just anonymous blobs. And as such, the one reason to watch the film, to see gnarly robots beat the snot out of each other, is rendered pointless. You might as well just get those toys out the loft. As bad as they are you'll probably have more fun.","Jan 17, 2008",,

"This was a great movie. There was a lot of action. Some people complain about it being told from a human perspective and the story doesn't give a lot of background details about each transformer. It would've been hard to give background details for each bot anyway since there were 13(5 Autobots, 8 Decepticons). I like how the perspective is, it shows just how giant the giant robots are. I went to the movies expecting to see 1 thing: Giant robots kicking the living crud out of each other. I got exactly what I wanted, and more. This movie was very funny. I was laughing so much during Transformers. The level of humor in this movie is great. Some aspects are different than the Generation 1 Transformers, but I think it works. Sure Bumble Bee turns into a Camaro not a VW Beetle. But image a little Beetle turning into all that robot. And the robots are more fancy looking, but again, I think it makes it better. At first I was skeptical of how the robots were designed to look more fancy, but I really started to like the looks of the robots. It worked well for the film. There are people complaining about the plot, but I want to know this: Why would you go see a movie about giant robots fighting and expect a plot that is riveting and deep more like a drama? I don't get it. And I thought the plot was good. A few holes here and there but it worked fine for me. In conclusion, if you want to see giant robots beat the tar out of each other, go see this movie. If you want to see a lot of humor, go see this movie. JUST GO SEE IT!!!!","Jul 25, 2007",9,/10

"I guess I'm either too intelligent or rather not quite dumb enough to enjoy this movie. I had heard all the reviews going in saying how excellent it was IF you could suspend some belief and not focus on the plot etc etc. Well...I can't I guess. This movie had so many ridiculous plot holes, worthless characters, under developed characters, etc etc that I found it impossible to truly enjoy it. YES, the action seems LOOKED really cool. But that was it. Plenty movies have action that looks cool but if you don't care about the characters AT ALL (i.e. Jazz...boo hoo he's dead, the only thing I knew about him was he break danced and talked like a rapper wannabe). The odd thing was you got the feeling that if the writers, director, editor etc had taken a little more time they'd have gotten it right. It is OK to have a simple plot but at least make the characters buy into it and live it. This movie went from War of the Worlds, to Herbie the LoveBug, to War Games, to MIB, to Bad Boys but never became a complete movie of its own. How can the team that did a silly comic book toy line like XMen get that SOOO right the first time but the team behind this puts out XMen3 on the first shot? For you who have seen it here are a few of my complaints / ideas.SPOILERS 1) No tension building in opening scenes. Blackout/Scorponok scenes could have had real impact if they had been built up a bit more. If they had removed all the Capt Lennox family bs (since it never had a payoff, his family life never comes into play by effecting a choice he makes or is felt in some other manor by say having the town his family lives in being wiped out if he doesn't do something.) they could have spent a few more minutes investing in building tension prior to Blackouts transformation and attack and/or developed the soldiers trek through the desert and Scorponok tracking them more.2) No tension built up in the Barricade/BumbleBee meet/fight. Again, skip the classroom scenes and some of the scenes with Sam's friend (again a character never utilized in this movie at all) and instead spend some time showing BumbleBee and Barricade searching for Sam, who'll get to him first type of thing.3) Frenzy - could have been a cool character if he was a little more serious and a little more mysterious. I know the writers must have thought he was good for kids but he isn't. My 5 year old kept asking me what he was saying and never really laughed at anything he did. (By the way, if you're trying to make a kiddie character don't have him use subtitles to speak, Frenzy was a Jar Jar Binks you REALLY couldn't understand) 4) BumbleBee - Barricade fight. How about showing it!!! Instead we cut away to the Gremlinsesque scenes with Frenzy and Sam and Mikaela.5) Autobot intro scene is too over the top. Adults think it's stupid/kids (once again) don't get what is going on or said. Character development for these guys should have been done here (and some in Sam's backyard) but instead all we get is slapstick comedy routines that quite honestly are not all that funny. (By the way, from now on can screenwriters have teams for doing movies like this where you have an action writer, romance writer and comedy writer, having two nerds try and write comedy and romance really sucks) 6) Hackers - Completely unnecessary. Especially Anthony Anderson. Not funny for adults or kids. Make no sense to adults. Kids. LOL. Are you serious, get back to the transformers. Again, I can see the point of having that one person who figures stuff out but too many were brought in here and given too much screen time. Keep is short and sweet, ie the guy that busts in the door in some armaggedonish movie and says, ""we have 4 days"".7) Sector 7 - should have been played serious, making them comical takes away all tension and anxiety in late scenes such as when the army guys and sector 7 guys square off on what to do (and your only job is dealing with the transformer threat and you end up being the MOST incompetent group fighting them??) 8)Final battle. Obviously this is where everyone on the production team put all their focus and it is a cool 30 minutes (minus the scenes with the hackers/defense secretary etc) or so but all the failures up to this point really take away how effective it could have been. You don't feel for Jazz dying cause he is under developed, you don't care for any of the Transformers on either side. Love or hate so you don't cheer when a Decepticon gets punked or cry when an Autobot is killed or wounded. The lack of emotions just makes this an eye candy scene that feels like it could have taken place anywhere in the film. There is no tension build up and you don't care who wins or loses.Overall. I walked out thinking, eh, it was OK. Not as good as I had hoped but bearable. But after a few days it started to bug me more and more especially when my son who loves the toys (he has at least 50 of them and it is all he wants to look at at Target and all he wants for Xmas every year etc) didn't care to want to go see it again. He actually asked to stay home and watch the Transformer Cybertron episodes we have on DVR. This could have been to him what Star Wars was to me but it didn't even come close. Sad.","Jul 9, 2007",6,/10
"I have low expectations for summer movies. I realize that they are often mindless entertainment with minimal plot and multiple explosions. That's fine. There is a place for such flicks, and I watch them without much hope of something grand. Remember that as I say this with no exaggeration: ""Transformers"" is the worst summer blockbuster I have ever seen. Let me take you through the anatomy of this horrible movie.From the stiff opening voice-over that details the backstory, you sense trouble. Thirty minutes in, you're still waiting for the movie to gain traction, even though a big action sequence already happened. As the action wanes, the awkward dialogue blares through. You realize this isn't Shakespeare, but George Lucas could have improved this script. Simple words in the midst of action are one thing, but as the focus of several too-long scenes, the lame dialogue is painfully amplified. When you're not sure if the humans are delivering their lines better than the robots, that's a bad sign.But you know more transformers are coming, so you wiggle your feet impatiently while anxiously awaiting their arrival. Finally the rest of the good guys show up. ""Wow, those are sweet looking robots!"" you think. You begin to settle in for a rip-roaring second half, until you realize there's not much else to them. It's like finally getting a date with that hot girl you've been crushing on, then realizing how unbelievably vapid she is before the main course is even served.By then of course you're stuck for the remainder of the evening. You deal with the ill-fated attempts at creating drama. Every ten minutes, you wonder what the heck is happening or question the movie's logic, which is awful even for the genre. You laugh several times, though the causes are largely unintentional. Is that John Tuturro wildly out of place? Does Tad Hamilton actually have a leadership position in the military? You hope desperately that the show might end with something redeeming like an epic battle. Here come all the bad guys (out of nowhere), this could be good...but no. The final clash is big and loud, but also confusing and by that juncture, pointless. Emotional attachment isn't necessary in a popcorn movie, but there needs to be at least a minute level of curiosity. You don't care if they kill the humans or kill the robots or kill all of them. Whatever.You sit through the credits, unsure of whether or not you want to be rewarded with a bonus scene. Yep, there's one. Yoikes, that was bad. At least it was short. Wait, there's one more, a final reminder of how miserably the movie failed, like the last rock that always crushed Wile E. Coyote.The worst part is that ""Transformers"" has potential, as the trailer proves. Vehicles turn into giant robots! How is that not cool?!? But the flick scarcely if ever delivers on that promise. The visuals are representative of the whole movie. Well done, occasionally impressive, but too often fights or transformations are seen either from a distance too great or too close, depriving the audience of the true scope of the shot, and of any interest in the movie.Perhaps a knowledge of the source material, with which I am only passingly familiar, would make the movie more palatable, but I doubt it. Director Michael Bay, whose projects have steadily declined since 1996's The Rock, has reached a new low.Bottom Line: Please don't encourage a sequel by seeing this movie. 2 of 10.","Jul 3, 2007",2,/10
"Now when it was announced that they were going to make a live action movie out of Transformers I thought,""NOOOOO DON'T DO THIS TO ME""! But then when they started to show the trailers I was very like---I don't know! Now that I have seen it I think that Michael Bay and Co. has absolutely pulled of the most UNBELIEVABLE CARTOON TO LIVE ACTION conversion, EVER!! This movie has everything that US Transformers FANS, loved about the cartoons. When I saw that they had recruited the same guy that actually talked for Optimus in the cartoon, I was already like this is going to be really good. This movie is nonstop action all they way through and also this movie was funnier then some other comedy movies! It was perfect in every way and I might go and see it again! Oh, For those that hated it, I guess you would rather see a bland transformation of the more that meets the eye bunch.

"I really don't get all the superbly positive comments. Sure the effects are sublime, the transformers are cool and the choreography of the action scenes is fantastic but thats not all.This movie starts out great in the 1st hour with great humor and tension build up, but then turns into some overacted overemotional ""epic"" storyline that really does not cut it. From one moment to the other the main characters suddenly are portrayed as heroic world savers. This includes slow motion effects and violin music.Talking about music, what's up with trumpets and cello's? I mean, when some tank transforms into a rampaging 30 ft monster robot with guns the size of my car, wouldn't heavy-metal or techno be more appropriate? Final conclusion is that this movie is worth seeing simply because the designers and art directors did their job sublimely. Michal Bay ruined the rest.","Jul 2, 2007",6,/10
"I was astounded when I saw the ratings on this movie. nearly 40% of people had given it 10/10 stars.Now I give it 5/10. The story is facile to the point of not really existing. Except for Shia LaBeouf, the acting was phoned in. The soundtrack was, well, just loud. It seemed to me that the whole point of the movie was to be a vehicle for product placements. In principle, with these flaws I normally wouldn't give a movie more than 4/10 (watch it on DVD on a rainy afternoon).But I'm willing to cut it some slack because it does have some cool FX and there are some funny moments in there. I did laugh several times. And of course it is supposed to come from a cartoon heritage so maybe we shouldn't expect *too* much. (But there are other cartoon-based movies that were way, way better. Remember Spiderman, Dick Tracy, Sin City, even the first of the X-Men series). So I gave it 5/10. （Well worth renting the DVD. Entertaining if not uplifting.) I'm willing to see that rational people could disagree with me and because they have different expectations, give this movie a 7/10. (i.e. very well worth paying good money to see it at a cinema.) I can even accept that some people work on a different scale to me and give it 8/10 because they really enjoyed it.But 34% of people giving it 10/10? Up there with Citizen Kane, Schindler's List, Gone with the Wind, Apocalypse Now, Lord of the Rings, City Lights, Blade Runner, Pulp Fiction etc etc etc.... Gimme a break! Seems most of the people rating movies these days are more interested in pushing ratings and driving box office than in giving any kind of honest opinion. Over half the raters gave this movie 10, 9, or 1/10. There is no way you could possibly say this movie deserves any of those ratings.","Dec 17, 2007",5,/10

"Despite some of the negative publicity surrounding it, Transformers was one of the most hyped movies of the summer for me. The trailers suggested it was going to be an all out action-orientated blockbuster, and despite the shoddiness of some of the films in Michael Bay's repertoire, I got pretty excited for it. Sadly, it failed to meet all of my expectations, and left a rather sour taste in my mouth that has lasted for the weeks since watching it.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is in high school, and is desperate to get his own car. He uses eBay and even his own history class to try to hawk off some of his grandfather's prized possessions in the hopes of making the money for it, but seems to be failing on all counts. Eventually, his father Ron (Kevin Dunn) caves, and helps purchase one for him. It runs beautifully, despite some rather strange occurrences in the used car lot, and is just the kind of car Sam has dreamed for. But rather soon after, the car begins to move on its own, and no sooner does Sam realize this when he actually witnesses the car transform into a robot and fight another car turned robot.This is the basic set-up for Transformers, which merges in elements of government intrigue, blatant Middle East war propaganda, epic CGI action sequences, and rather absurd humour, all revolving around the Autobots (good transformers) centuries old battle with the Decepticons (bad transformers), and both of their races' search for a highly technical piece of rock that just happens to be hiding somewhere on Earth.Regardless of any fanboy pressure, Bay created the movie he wanted, and it turned out to be a totally convoluted and mixed bag. Looking away from the basics of the story, it seems like the writers and Bay himself tacked on a bit too much in the way of getting the film from point-to-point like any good highly stylized action film attempts to. Scenes with lengthy hacker technical jargon go on far beyond the point they pine for, and scenes where they attempt to go simply for laughs fall flat on their face as near frivolous wastes of time. I rarely see movies that seem to jog around the point for much longer than they should, but for a master of cuts and edits, it seems like Bay just wanted to add in every idea any writer could have ever had for this film, and just make the film a lot more bulky in its running time than it needed to be. It just begs of needing a qualified editor to tell Bay just when enough is. It ruined the near great concept he had in The Island, and it almost ruins everything here.But the story is really secondary here to the CGI. And does that ever deliver on the promises of the trailers. Every transformer looks sleek and polished, to the point of looking above and beyond realistic. Their interactions with each other, and even human characters is at a level of animation that is rarely seen with mainstream films. Where the likes of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix just has their characters look almost blatantly fake in front of their CGI backgrounds or characters, the animators on Transformers have actually taken the time to make everything look authentic and look real. Half-way through the film you stop thinking these robots do not exist, and start wondering how long it is going to take before you actually see one up close and personal. And that is just looking at them walking around, the scenes with them in battle between each other are even better (even with them being highly stylized edit-wise).The voice acting is all top notch, across the board (I particularly dug the ever reliable Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime yet again, and Hugo Weaving as Megatron). The real actors acting is not as great. LaBeouf does his best to support the robots, and pulls off a fairly decent performance. We have obviously seen him in much stronger roles demanding much more of his acting capabilities, but for the little amount of real acting he has to do here (which does not include the running, screaming or genuine awe at what is going on in front of him), he does pretty adequately. His mandatory love interest, Mikaela (Megan Fox), does about as much as her gorgeous one-dimensional character needs to. The rest of the supporting cast, rounded out by Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro (in his most uselessly over-the-top performance ever) and Jon Voight, all do sufficiently enough, but like all the supporting characters in Bay films, basically serve the function of helping the film move from beginning to middle to end (and of course, help explain the jargon being employed by the extras).But while the film may have its follies, what truly destroys the foundations it successfully employs, is the deliberate product placements scattered throughout the movie. Unlike the cartoon versions of Transformers, almost every single car is a brand name one. Mentions of eBay literally fly through character's mouths, and there's even a whole two minute long conversation about how great Nokia is. I understand the need for product placement, but when the film dwindles on these symbols for more than a mere second, it just shows me how unashamed these filmmakers were in creating this film. If I wanted to see an advertisement for cars, phones, Burger King and Mountain Dew, I would sit through a television commercial or read a magazine.It disgusted me to see just how far Bay and company milked the placements, and to me, stands as the one true killer of everything that Transformers has going for it. Yes, it is a fairly good action film with some amazing effects, but at the price of being one huge commercial.7/10.","Aug 19, 2007",7,/10
"I remember finding this movie a bit on the boring side when it first came out, (probably because of my age) but now that i rewatched it the other day, i find it pretty good, sure some of the acting can be a bit... well bad, but its just the perfect movie to watch while shoving popcorn down your throat (would recommend even if it has alot of micheal bay cliches)","May 8, 2019",8,/10

"Great entertainment value. For the first part of the movie, I thought it's gonna be a bombardment of actions, car chase, and bombing, but it has turned out okay in the storytelling part as well.How the screenwriter utilizes autobots is very smart. They are not just sidekicks or tools for action. They are heroes themselves with charming characteristics who protect humans and communicate with humans. This is the main reason this movie can become a huge franchise.'Transformers' happened before 'Iron Man' with the same imagination and creativity level. That's how revolutionary the idea, the computer graphic, and the excitement were.","Dec 17, 2020",8,/10

"This movie is probably the most incomprehensible piece of trash film I have ever seen.Its typical Michael Bay fare - an empty but full-of-itself plot interrupted every 10 minutes or so with a half hour's worth of smoke, loud explosions, and metal crashing against one another. (See Pearl Harbor) This one is made particularly bad by Shia Lebouf's spastic, annoying performance. If you've seen anything this kid has done, you've seen it all. Lebouf's acting grab-bag seems to consist of talking fast....and talking too fast.Lebouf's performance is the keystone of a plot that won't be too appealing to an audience who values logic in an entertaining story. Why a group of super space robots so advanced they can shift their shape to mirror an alien race's technology can have anything hidden from them or need the help of the young boy to find it is a question that Bay hopes the audience won't be concerned with as they sit enamored with his signature bells, whistles, and gunshots.However, the transformers were an important part of many of our lives as children, and there were certainly many other people leaving the theater who enjoyed it. If you like the transformers (or are one of those nerds who decided you did because you wanted to wear an optimus prime t-shirt you say at Hot Topic, even though you never actually watched the cartoon) you may still enjoy it.If you respect film and enjoy good movies, rent something and stay home.","Jul 5, 2007",2,/10
"One of the most fascinating franchises in the world of modern cinema has got to be director Michael Bay's near decade-long cinematic opus known simply as the ""Transformers"" series. Inspired by the classic cartoons and toys of the 80's, the current line of feature-film releases is quite something to behold... Four films with a fifth on the way next year to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the original film. And all four having been massive hits financially, bringing in billions in revenue. Yet all four have also suffered from consistent and even growing disdain from not only critics, but from general audiences as a whole. Every announcement or trailer for the latest entry is instantly met with rolled eyes and exasperated scoffs from film-goers the world over. It's what makes the franchise such an interesting one... They are so frequently dismissed and ridiculed, yet people keep going back to them with each new release. And I do think a big part of why this happens is this film, 2007's ""Transformers."" Because it was such a surprising Summer-time treat upon initial release... it was just good, plain fun and it won many people over with its quirky sense of humor and grand visual scope. So no matter how many follow-ups of exceedingly low quality they pump out... no matter how many missteps the franchise takes with each and every sequel... no matter just how terrible some later films have turned out... we all keep paying for our tickets and popcorn when the newest entry is released, in some hope that it will recapture even a fraction of this film's splendid sense of entertainment value.The film starts with the sort-of classic tale of a boy and his car, as teenager Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) gets a yellow Chevrolet as a gift. However, he soon discovers that his car has a life of its own, and belong to a race of shape-shifting alien beings from the planet Cybertron. These aliens have split into two factions- the heroic Autobots lead by Optimus Prime, who Sam's car Bumblebee follows... and the dreaded and vile Decepticons. As it turns out, the Decepticons are tracking Sam, having come to learn that he inadvertently holds the coordinates to an ancient device known as the ""AllSpark"", which they are seeking at all costs. And so, Sam and his massive crush Mikaela (Megan Fox) must team up with Optimus and the Autobots in order to keep the Decepticons from getting their hands on the mysterious AllSpark device.The film is very much an exercise in pure escapism. From the cheese-fest opening monologue to the thrilling but overlong climax, the film never loses sight of its goal, which is to entertain first, ask questions later. And I think that's a large part of its success. This is not a film that wants to bog itself down on complex characterization or sublime story development. If there's a scene of characters talking, there's going to be a joke. If a robot is on-screen, there's going to be a fight. And thanks to a solid enough script and Bay's trademark kinetic directorial style, it works very well. There's hardly a dull moment to be had, the human characters are all instantly identifiable archetypes, the robotic characters are just a ton of fun, and the visuals are all too often stunning. You'll be shocked at just how perfectly realized the Transformers are in this film, especially for a mid-2000's release.Beyond that, I found the cast to be fairly charming as well. Despite his public downfall in recent years, LaBeouf shines as Sam, giving him a wonderfully awkward social sensibility and a great physical performance. He really is quite engaging as our human lead. Fox is obviously here more for looks than personality thanks to Bay's constant oggling of her character, but I actually thought she did a halfway decent job here. The film may treat her as little more than eye- candy, but I think there's a little more going on with her than many will give her credit for. Supporting roles by the likes of John Turturro, Jon Voight and Anthony Anderson are all a ton of fun. And the voice-over rolls by a cast include original cartoon alum Peter Cullen and the wonderfully insidious Hugo Weaving give a great deal of depth to the animated characters on-screen.Look, ""Transformers"" isn't going to win any major awards. It's a popcorn movie at its heart and it knows this and celebrates it with each passing moment. And while I could drone on and on about the faults that are present, it wouldn't change the fact that I got a huge kick out it. I love it. And I still watch it here and there, even ten years later. While the subsequent sequels that followed have been of a generally sub-par quality, it doesn't change the fact that the original is a fantastic, breezy bit of good fun.And so, I give 2007's ""Transformers"" a very good 8 out of 10. Pop it in. Shut off your brain. And get ready to have a good time!","Dec 7, 2016",8,/10
"This movie mostly disappointed because of its story. The movie is muddling on too much and for too long. The story would often simply feel as a lame excuse to let Autobots and Decepticons battle and make lots of stuff blow up and cause mayhem everywhere they go. Often events occur without an obvious connection to the other. It was like the story came secondary and the movie was all about it's images. In that regard this movie does not disappoint. I mean, the movie is technically well made and good looking. Typically for a Bay movie, there are lots of characters put into the movie. Some characters really don't seem to serve a purpose at all in the long run, despite their heavy introduction and actors portraying them. I don't think I ever complained about this before in a Michael Bay movie but he now have seemed to have reached a point by me that it becomes annoying, mainly because it's so completely unnecessary and probably also one of the reason's why the movie is about 2 and a halve hour long, though it easily could had been simply a more bearable 2 hours. I'm no Michael Bay hater. Quite on the contrary! But this just isn't his best movie. His most ambitious perhaps, yes. Which perhaps made the movie all the more disappointing to me. Seemed to me they couldn't really made up their minds whether they wanted to make a serious straight-forward action flick, or a more fun and comical like one. The result is an unbalanced mix of these two opposite generic elements.The action is also somewhat disappointing. Yeah sure, it's always cool to see lots of things blowing up in a Bay movie but as for the fights between the Autobots and Decepticons, which is what the movie in essence is all about often; Most of the time you can't really tell what's going on, also because it's going so fast and all you basically see are just 2 big pieces of metal running, flying, firing and jumping at each other. It's also confusing because you often really can't tell who is fighting who at the time.They obviously tried to put in an emotional tie between the human main characters and the Autobots, who are basically being presented as the protectors of humanity. But the whole relationship between human's and droid's doesn't work out very convincingly and effective. The movie feels like there is an human part in the movie and a robotic part. It just never really feels as one whole, as if both were happening in a total different universe. Often the Transformers also weren't given enough room in the movie. Also Megatron (and a couple of the other Autobots and the evil Decepticons) makes his appearance way too late, which does not allow him any time to really shine and impress as the real big main villain of the movie.Shia LaBeouf was perhaps the thing that surprised the most about this movie. I already expected and predicated great things from him after seeing him for the first time in the underrated movie ""Constantine"" but I didn't yet expected him to already completely carry an high budget summer-flick such as ""Transformers"" on his own.Technically there is of course little wrong with the movie. Leave it up to Bay to blow up things in am impressive big, yet convincing way. The Transformers are also all greatly designed, though they perhaps a look a bit too much alike in their robotic forms, as I all previously had mentioned. No doubt the movie shall score a couple of technical Oscar nomination's.I'll most likely watch ""Transformers 2"" but I hope they put some more effort in the story and the flow of it next time. That way it can be the perfect summer-blockbuster of 2009, if it's still being released by then that is.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","Dec 23, 2007",6,/10
"TRANSFORMERS is a thoroughly depressing movie for all the wrong reasons. I knew it wasn't going to be particularly good, as I am in no way a fan of Michael Bay, but literally EVERYONE I know who saw this film has been raving about all year long. I finally Netflixed it and I'm sorry I did.The original Transformers wave hit when I was in the middle of my teen years, so it pretty much passed me by, but I was aware of the comics and toys (never watched the cartoon). I ""get"" why they were and are huge. If I were a kid, I'd probably love this stuff unconditionally. But maybe I'm too old or too discriminating, 'cause TRANSFORMERS is without a doubt the WORST film I've sat through all year long. All of the ""Sins of Michael Bay"" are here... the obnoxious characters, the migraine-inducing soundtrack/sound effects, the ridiculously over-done explosions, the hyper-editing and the over-the-top schtick.None of it works. What's worse is that most people couldn't see through what a completely lazy, talentless and unimaginative movie this really is. Steven Spielberg should be ashamed of himself, but he's sitting on a giant pile of money thanks to this dreck, so what do I know? Just bloody awful. If you were having doubts about seeing/renting this, trust me... you'll hate yourself for it afterwards.","Dec 10, 2007",1,/10
"Transformers is from the director named Michael Bay. He is well known besides for Bad Boys, The Rock This film tends to lead to a direction of mindlessly entertainment and enjoyment. As we've come to expect, robot's destructions and combats, we do get these aspects in veritable satisfaction. Michael Bay is well known for chaotic, blotchy destruction that gets convoluted or diverting. Either way, this film embraces these that makes the yet the best Transformers film out of the series.Transformers follows a young teenage boy who wants to buy his first car ever. Meanwhile, a conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons intensify as they strive to retrieve 'The Cube' that can transform any material into a biological metal being. Sam (Shia LaBeouf) perchance buys a car that tends to be a transformer as he gets yanked into a situation that can redeem the human race with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). As the plot is simple enough, it is equitable for this type of film. Audiences do not bother about the plot being splendidly the prime. Most of the audiences crave great and astonishing robot actions. We fulfill these aspects from the film. Evenly, the visuals are marvelous. The CGI is flawless as it is the fundamental requirement and it looks precisely realistic. The sound is spotlessly well crafted. There is a gracious finish to the sound as the immaculately designed cars transform into frantic robots. However, the characters are very poorly scripted and executed. They are notably unrealistic and sometimes sadly annoying. Although frenetic robot actions are stunning and frigid to look at, flat characters still bother the film to a negative side ward. Shia LaBeouf is surprisingly tolerable as the teenage boy who is mentally junior. Megan Fox is usual, she is adequate but faulty at some acting. The acting is just adequate or exceptional in terms of big action flicks like this. Overall, Transformers is the film you may or may not have expected the outcome to be. It may entertain you or find the movie to be boring and disappointing. In my opinion, I was still entertained through all the years and gave chances for the sequels to be superior. Grade: B+","May 18, 2017",8,/10
"Most fun I've had at the movies in ages!! This movie had it all! It was funny, exciting, spectacular special effects and cinematography! I love Shia LaBeouf! I see him as becoming the next great and popular actor of his generation. I didn't expect the movie to have as many laughs as it did. I actually was laughing out loud. Everyone clapped at the end. I brought my nephew, who is 10 and he said it was the best movie he ever saw. I think its a movie for all ages and I think most people will enjoy it and I hope it becomes this summer's blockbuster hit! I highly recommend this very entertaining and fun movie!","Jul 5, 2007",,
"The good news is that this formulaic, high-octane action movie from Michael Bay is pretty entertaining stuff; the bad news is that it feels like it was directed by a semi-retarded spider monkey on crack. Jarring visuals, incomprehensible fight scenes, and overblown special effects are at least somewhat mitigated by appealing performances and, of course, state-of-the-art CGI.In this remake of the 1985 film that was spawned by the cheesy cartoon series, evil robots have arrived on Earth to reunite with their leader, Megatron, who came to the planet a couple of millennia ago in search of the Allspark, a box of something or other that will enable Megatron and the other Decepticons to rule the universe! Only Megatron crashed into the Arctic and froze. Well, as much as a robot can freeze; he was merely paralyzed. Meanwhile, the good-guy robots from the same planet, the Autobots, have tracked Megatron to Earth, also in search of the Allspark.Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf is an awkward teen who's trying to earn money to buy his first car. Of course, since he's awkward and somewhat smart, we know he's the hero. And we know who his enemies are, too, because they're the ones who laugh at him. They'll all be sorry! They're not too sorry when Sam's first car turns out to be a beat-up yellow Camaro, although they might be a little bedeviled when they find out the car's really an Autobot.It's up to Sam, his new galpal Mikaela (Megan Fox), the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight), and the U.S. Army to somehow defeat the Decepticons, who will stop at nothing to find the Allspark, even if it means exterminating all the ant-sized humans. Luckily, Sam and company also have the Autobots on their side, and a showdown of giant robot versus giant robot is ON, brother.One puzzling problem with the movie is that the Autobots don't show up until a good half hour into the film. I guess this was to establish the all-important Sam-Mikaela relationship, which naturally will eventually blossom into something bigger. Because, of course, the dorky guy always gets the hot chick, even if he has to defeat giant robots to do it. But it's true, presenting the backstory of the characters before showing us the Autobots does add a more human aspect to the film; otherwise it would be just a big, violent robot-versus-robot extended fight sequence. Wait, it was that anyway.Michael Bay movies are not immune to clichés; they revel in them, exploiting them to complement the loud pyrotechnics. Or maybe the loud pyrotechnics are there to distract us from the inane characterizations and dopey plot. In any event, how many movies have we in which an intern/trainee/cadet is the only one, out of literally thousands of experts, to solve the problem? How many have we seen in which someone working for the forces of Good manages to sneak something secret out of an otherwise-secure facility? On the other hand, this was one movie in which the military is actually competent; where the guys with guns know what they're doing and aren't the shoot-first, ask-questions-later types? That was surprising, and amusing.And I realize this will confirm me as a cranky old man, no matter my chronological age, but what was UP with all of the loud music? Every scene was shot as if it were a crappy heavy-metal video, circa 1986. Grating guitars turned up to eleven on the volume control drowned out some dialog and a lot of sound effects, such as robots doing robotic things. Add that to the hyperactive zooming, panning, and scanning, and this is certainly not a movie that an epileptic should ever watch.Nor is it a movie that young kids should watch, in all honesty. Transformers is rated PG-13, but it's pretty violent; the only thing that's lacking is actual blood. People get blown up, smashed, crushed, and shot by robots, and it's pretty intense stuff. So be careful when bringing little Timmy to this one, unless you want to put up with a week of nightmares and nocturnal enuresis. This ain't the Transformers you grew up with.","Jul 8, 2007",6,/10
"A lot of people have problems with the Transformers series, including the running joke about the crazy amount of explosions. Critics savage this entire series, and just look at the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. There are two opposing sides for the Transformers line, that being the standard movie audience, me and you, and the critics. And these two sides just can't seem to get along. The point of these movies is to have a good time, and that is exactly what I did when I watched this movie. Now, I do agree with the critics in some certain areas, such as the more than obvious tie-in with Hasbro, some critics saying it is just a glorified Hasbro commercial. I can agree with that, but does that really matter?First off, I do have some problems with Transformers, certainly. One of which being the run time. It is hard for a movie to stay very interesting for 143 minutes, and for a while in the middle it got rather stale. The variety of the camera tricks and action sequences can be considered at least somewhat lacking as well. That's for sure. Also, the camera work can be somewhat annoying at times as well. It was clear what was being attempted, but the execution was just a little off. Shaky action scenes and heavily repeated camera tricks can get a little old sometimes.But never mind that, I'll move on to the good stuff, which was much more abundant. Most important, the movie was fun. That was what it should have been, and that is what it was. Big explosions, big action, and lots of fast-paced, adrenaline-filled scenes. The CGI was a big part of this, seeing as how it was near flawless. It's difficult to make giant alien robots turning into cars and back multiple times look real, but, there you go. And honestly, maybe that's the only redeeming quality of the movie. Acting is par-level, script has shaky legs at times, and the rest of the movie is generally average. But the insane action scenes and purely amazing cinematic rush, to me, is deserving of an 8/10.","Jun 23, 2016",8,/10
"As the title of the film suggest: ""a Michael Bay film, Transformers""Transformers (2007) is Michael Bay's version of the Transformers of which he described as a ""stupid toy movie"" before he was educated about the subject matter by Hasbro. The movie therefore reflected Bay's vision of the Transformers which in ways are different from the original.Apart from that is also the fact that the movie is just a commercial film for the mass market filled with Product Placements.Even with all the effort and brilliance in creating the live action movie using CGI & special effects (which is entertaining to the mass market), the movie really fell short on capturing what should be the essence of the original Transformer characters.As a film it did not do strongly on story telling, creating a compelling atmosphere & developing characters. What it did however was to put on a show of explosion, crashes & cheap humor.Sure the film entertained in terms of giving its audience a cinematic experience with visual & sound (mostly bass) effects but is a good film based just on that alone?Whatever happened to script writing, screenplay, cinematography, directing, editing & complimenting musical score?Is this the way movies should be made even if the audience should cheer & applaud them?As a media of great influence, shouldn't movie makers at least consider what values & messages they are sending out by their creation?When Optimus Prime & his Autobots made up their mind to save earth and the human race, just what kind of a world are they really saving?A world of destruction, a world that sees commercial values above all else and a world whose people view a film like Michael Bay's Transformer something of high regard?Just who are these robots in disguised as the Transformers?","Jul 8, 2007",7,/10

"I loved the first 15 minutes of this movie. Unfortunately, the film didn't end until almost two hours later.Here was the recipe: start with fifteen minutes of interesting character development and mysterious robot attacks. Next, throw out all efforts to deepen character development in favor of moving the lame plot forward. Next, bring in several unnecessary and uninteresting characters (the blond computer hacker and her black friend) to confuse things and take up time. Then, make the audience wait for the action by adding unnecessary attempts at humor (i.e. the scene at the boy's house and the addition of the John Tuturro character with Special unit 7 or whatever it was called). Finally, be sure to fill the remaining time with cool shots of the transformers transforming and shooting things (which were good I must admit). The audience will be awed by the special effects and won't realize what a poor movie they've just seen.By the way, how is it that one robot could destroy an entire outpost earlier in the film but a whole fleet of robots couldn't hit even one marine later on? Those guys must have trained at the G.I. Joe headquarters to be able to dodge so many bullets. This movie started great but quickly transformed into a sub par action film with shallow characters and little plot. The special effects were great but they weren't enough to keep this film from ending up on the scrap heap of mediocre action films.","Jul 7, 2007",5,/10
"Transformers was a very good film that I enjoyed enough to watch three times when it was in the theater. It is pretty entertaining and also sets a good foundation for future sequels to be made.Sam Whitwicky has a pair of his grandfathers glasses. On these glasses are coordinates to find the cube, the cube is a cube that is able to give life to machines and turns them into transformers. The autobots arrive on Earth and warn Sam and must have the glasses. Unfortunately the Decepticons also arrive on Earth.I think the effects were outstanding in this film. All of the Transformers in this film looked very real. I like how they gave them a new look, and did not just 100 percent give them the same look that they had in the cartoon. This shows that the director and effects people gave new interpretations to characters.The story was good, not great. But I think that at times it gets a little complicated, especially with the military. Not overly confusing, but a little. Also I think that the film tends to drag a lot, I understand the importance of build up, but it takes a while for all of the Transformers to appear.The human characters were OK. However I think there were way too many human characters that speak a lot in this film. I want to see lots of different Transformers, not humans.Now for the Transformers. I think they included most of the ones they needed to in a first film. Optimus Prime was great as were the rest of the autobots (Jazz, Bumblebee, Ratchet, and Ironhide). The Decepticons were awesome as well, however it was interesting how some of the decepticons were not similar to what they were in the television show. Like how Frenzy was a boom box and Bonecrusher was a minesweeper. The decepticons, other than Megatron, did not get to say much of anything nearly as much as the autobots.The action is OK. BUt when the Autobots were fighting the Decepticons it kind of gets hard to tell who is winning and who is losing. Basically the fight scenes are fast and the Transformers blend together and as a result you have no idea what is going on.Megan Fox was great, I love her assets. Not much more to say on that topic.So this film is very good. IF anything this film set the groundwork, so while it may lack in some areas you know that the next films should be great thanks to this film. I recommend this film and also can not wait for the sequel.","Jun 7, 2009",8,/10
"Was well looking forward to it, and once again, poorly acted, terrible script and some awful characters detracted from what in fact could've been one of the greatest Action Flicks ever... stunning effects are spoilt by the inane drivel of the main character played by Shia LaBeouf who quite frankly is now up there with Slater on my most hated list. There isn't a scene he's in without mouthing off and just creating noise... which brings me onto the most disappointing thing about the film... IT'S THE NOISIEST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN... and it's TOO much... there's no build up properly, it's literally just bang smash caaapppoooo for 2 hours 24 minutes and it's just an assault on the senses... I need a let up in a film... and this doesn't have it.However, the roberts are everything and more I expected and it's certainly done justive to the cartoon from the 80's... in fact, it's got one scene that's so nicely filmed it's one of my favourite scenes ever and it's only 5-10 seconds long... with the ""roller scating"" Deceptacon chasing Optima Prime... WOW... it looks incredible.Great idea, solid film making... but could've been incredible... shame...Pug","Jul 30, 2007",7,/10
"We are far beyond a time when special effects alone could carry a movie. Unfortunately, that's what they have tried to do here.A weak plot full of one-dimensional human characters leaves barely any room for the Transformers fans went to this movie to see. Terrible designs aside, the robots had little character and practically no dialogue to speak of. The plot itself is simple enough to follow, and yet somehow they still managed to leave it chock full of holes and loose ends. A pointlessly long and drawn out introduction leads to a rushed and underwhelming ending- and If you're hoping to see any epic robot battles, you had best not blink during the movie.There were some humorous scenes mixed in, but most were tacky and some were downright insulting.Overall this movie was a huge disappointment, even for someone going in with no expectations. It fails to deliver as a stand alone movie as well as a film adaptation of the Transformers fans know and love.","Jul 3, 2007",1,/10

"I do my film review of the TRANSFORMERS movie franchise and I am going to start with the first installment of the franchise, released in 2007.The film follows Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets caught up in a war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery.The Autobots intend to use the AllSpark, the object that created their robotic race, in an attempt to rebuild Cybertron and end the war while the Decepticons desire control of the AllSpark with the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth.The film was developed in 2003 and the film went into production in 2006 and it was released on July 3, 2007 and the film was really amazing when I first saw the feature film and I was impress to see the Transformers on screen and I really did not know what they were until I went online and found out more about them.The CGI and action sequences were amazing and the Autobots and the Decepticons were really created well with the help of computer-generated imagery and the final fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron is my favorite action sequence in the Transformers film released in 2007.My favorite Transformer characters are Optimus Prime, Bumbleebee, Jazz and Ratchet. Peter Cullen does the voice of Optimus Prime and he does a great job. Mark Ryan does a really great job as Bumblebee. ""Family Matters"" actor Darius McCrary plays Jazz. Robert Foxxworthy plays Ratchet and they are both amazing in their performances. Hugo Weaving from V FOR VENDETTA and THE MATRIX TRILOGY does a really great job and it is amazing to hear him as Megatron.The human characters are also great. Shia LaBeouf is really good as the lead, while Megan Fox is really hot and is amazing and she was the right choice to play the love interest of Shia LaBeouf and the two on-screen together is really amazing in this film. Tyrese Gibson is real cool. Josh Duhamel is really amazing too. Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson and Rachael Taylor plays their parts really amazing in their performances and the screen time they have.Steve Jablonsky's score is really amazing in this film and I really enjoyed Linkin Park's song, ""What I've Done"" and I loved the music video and their other two songs from the other two films, ""New Divide"" and ""Iridescent"" in Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon and the song by Imagine Dragons from Age of Extinction is called ""Battle Cry"". I liked that song, too.Overall, TRANSFORMERS is a perfect movie by all means and I am giving this an 8 out of 10.","May 4, 2015",8,/10
"I always thought Transformers seemed like one of those franchises that wouldn't transfer well onto film. This actually transfered pretty well. By no means is it perfect, some names have actually been changed, and some of the Transformers' alternate forms have been changed, (most likely for legal and copyright reasons). Those minor changes don't really harm the film at all.The Special Effects is what makes this movie a great action film, you are aware that these are giant robots, so you know it's special effects, but they move so fluidly and blend into the real-life setting in which they've been placed, that it's hard to not forget that they aren't real. I do wish that they made the Transformers a little more character, you get that there are GOOD and EVIL but you basically only get that because you're told who's evil or good. The film relies on the Human's perspective of the situation, not really the Transformers. Some more character development for both the Decepticons and Autobots would have made this movie A lot better. I do realize that sounds weird, but the movie is called Transformers for a reason.This is Mr. Bay's best film in my books.7 out of 10","May 19, 2008",6,/10

"I went into Transformers expecting to see a childhood memory butchered into a mass appeal CGI fest. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not so, and the movie had me well entertained almost the entire way through. The cast was good and likable, even though the script had some seriously dodgy dialog in places it did the job, and the Tranformer effects and character designs themselves were well realized.The main problem I had with the movie was the way the Transformers were treated as side characters to the human cast. The characters I remember were reduced to mere CGI set pieces with little personality, and most only have a few lines of dialog and are only introduced briefly towards the middle of the film.I also am not particularly a fan of the way Michael Bay directed the more hectic action scenes, with the camera shaking all over the place. I know some prefer it, but I personally did not, and thought it took away from the incredible CGI.Overall, a good, but not great movie which could have done with some more Tranformer screen time and character development.","Jul 26, 2007",7,/10
"While I know I'll get wailed on for this especially since its my first comment, I have to side with the haters on this one. I like so many others grew up in the 80's watching and loving Transformers. And when I saw that the movie was coming, I actually didn't have high hopes. With everything else that we loved as children being reinvented, revamped, reworked, retooled, reloaded, rehashed, and any other words that describe something wonderful being fed into a wood chipper then spat back onto our movie screens, this was no different than those three Wolverine plus ensemble films, or Willy and the chocolate factory. This movie could have been so huge, and everyone else other than me and my sister raves about it. I suppose I was immune to the LSD in the Pepsi. What film did they watch. This is supposedly an action film that somewhere gets sucked up in a tornado and lands into a bad comedy. Practically every scene is laced with moronic jokes. The plot tries to focus on way to many non sequential characters. Am I watching a movie about robots? About military guys fighting a scorpion? About computer hackers? An American Pie teen sex comedy? Shia Lebouff comes off as your typical done a thousand times teen underdog who is shy, and socially inept, yet gets the hot girl anyway. The girl comes off as very slutty to me for some reason. And the chemistry between the two just isn't believable. The girl's dialog is tedious at best with lines like ""They know your name"" yeah thanks I caught that 2 seconds ago when they said it. The Transformers themselves are sad shells of their cartoon versions. The transformations themselves while cool are very confusing, many of the robots are similar in color scheme and you loose track of which one is which. I'm not even entirely sure what Megatron transformed into.....a jet of some sort? He was always a gun or a cannon in the show. Basically if you loved this show as a child and don't get swept up by the hype and the thrall of ""Its transformers, so I'll love it no matter how bad it sucks"" mentality, you will hate this movie. You'll spend your entire time cringing at masturbation jokes, and peeing Autobots. Personally I think the taco bell dog joke was pretty bad, that social reference has been dead for years, let it go.","Sep 16, 2007",1,/10

"Transformers, for me, is a film that veers somewhere between the absolutely spectacular and the cringe-worthy, the predictable and the plain bad.First of all, the good things. Transformers, in all likelihood, contains the best action sequences that you will see all year. They are as bold and exciting and as crazy as anything in Michael Bay's career. The opening assault on the desert base is fantastic and the final forty five minutes that takes the action from the Hoover dam to the very heart of the city is sustained on pure adrenalin. Alongside this, if it doesn't pick up awards for its effects come Oscar season it will be a crime. There's a fantastic sequence in which Optimus Prime transforms before our very eyes in near slow-motion and we get to see every piston and bolt and panel twisting into shape. For that alone it's breathtaking. Similarly, the Transformers are as real and believable as King Kong was eighteen months. If Peter Jackson was rightly lauded for breathing such humanity into a giant living breathing ape, then Bay should be afforded even greater credit for the enthusing his giant robots with such lifelike traits and dignity. My only complaint would be the lack of Megatron until the final thirty minutes! As well as this, there is a performance that stands out as well. Although much attention has been drawn to Shia LeBeof (who I shall reluctantly come to later), the real standout, for me, came from Josh Duhamel. Admittedly he didn't have his limits stretched in the role of Captain Lennox but what he did have to do he did extremely well. Perhaps the biggest compliment that I can pay him is to say that he reminded me of a Terminator/Aliens era Michael Biehn. A piece of casting that Bay no doubt intended but, nonetheless, Duhamel pulled it off charismatic aplomb. Unfortunately, there is little more positive that I have to say. For whilst I thoroughly enjoyed Tranformers whilst Bay was doing what he does best, the whole film is let down by a lacklustre script, weak two-dimensional characters, cringe-worthy attempts at humour and a crushing level of predictability. We've simply seen Transformers so many times before. I mentioned Aliens and The Terminator earlier on but this movie stomps on narrative territories that have been de rigeur in modern blockbusters since Independence Day. That is not to say that Bay has ripped anything off but simply that there is very little original here. Multiple narratives that pull together to include geeky boys, attractive and seemingly unattainable objects of affection, computer experts who are ignored, US military overwhelmed by higher civilisations (apart from a single hardcore special ops unit of course) and shady Government organisations kept secret from even the highest ranking politicians. Transformers is a positive melting pot of modern blockbuster clichés. Duhamel aside, the casting doesn't particularly help either. Megan Fox simply seems to be included to satisfy the audiences objectification needs, the heavyweight Jon Voight simply coasts his way to another paycheck and Bay shoehorns in every single African-American stereotype into the roles occupied by Tyrese Gibson, Anthony Anderson and Bernie Mac. Whilst it is always a pleasure to see John Turturro on screen, you could practically see his tongue protruding from his cheek in almost every single scene! As for Shia LeBeof, I am mystified how his star is rising so quickly in Hollywood. I'm all for studio's moving away from the bland leading clones of the early 00's but he's like the terrifying result of genetic experiments of Corey Feldman's pickled liver. An irritating smart-ass who here appears to be regurgitating his performance in Constantine. Which leads nicely to the films biggest problems. The script. Oh dear. Right from the offset the script hums with a mixture of cheese and sleaze. If I were a cynical man, I'd argue that half of the reason that the action is so effective is simply because we have been aching for Bay to show some mercy and shut the characters up! LeBeouf and Anderson are prominent offenders but the characters of Ron and Judy Witwicky are by far the most grating. Intended as comic relief no doubt but ultimately an embarrassing instrument of torture. Like the Levensteins dumbed down and living under the Witness Protection Scheme. One can only presume that any sequel will have Alyson Hannigan returning from band camp to win Sam back from Mikaela! Indeed, it's the moments in which Bay is trying to be self-consciously funny that really grate. There are some humorous exchanges that genuinely do work (""I'm gonna count to five""... ""I'm gonna count to three"") but when Bay steps out of his comfort zone the results often induce uncomfortable seat-squirming. The extended sequence in which the Autobots ""hide out"" in the Witwicky's back garden is the case in point. Heavy-handed, laboured and below even cartoonish. Transformers is, unfortunately, riven with such moments. I left the cinema last night with the same mixture of satisfaction and disappointment that I felt when I watched King Kong. There is a lot to enjoy about Transformers and if you are looking for big, dumb fun then this film ticks all the boxes. However, be warned, there is a lot of dumb, not-so-fun, small talk to wade through too.","Jul 28, 2007",6,/10
"I can't fathom how anyone gives a film like this a 9 or a 10...but, then, I can't figure out why people enjoy Jerry Springer or went to the theatre to see The Dukes of Hazzard.This film passes the most important test in Hollywood which is to make money. In that sense, it's a success. The problem is, that's the only parameter that seems to matter anymore.The story is weak, which can be forgiven since it's based on a children's series. But there are issues with the story and characters that any mediocre writer could have handled. The film couldn't decide if it wanted to be for kids or adults, or somewhere in between. The movie starts off as a typical Michael Bay project with lots of action which keeps it interesting. When the Autobots finally show up, the film degrades into a miasma of adolescent lameness with robots speaking in ""characterizations"" that are stupid, unrealistinc (even for a film like this) and annoying.I can enjoy a mindless popcorn movie. I had fun with Armaggeddon. This is the worst film I've seen in a very long for more reasons that I can even get in to.","Aug 17, 2007",1,/10

"Michael Bay has sunk a small flotilla of his Pearl Harbour demons with the high-octane, CGI-laden, robopron that is Transformers.Sure the fanboys will bore us all to the planet Tedium with their critiques of the minutiae and demand some sort of supreme interplanetary justice that the Camaro gets redrawn as a VW Beetle in the Director's Edition DVD-set with Limited Edition Lube Dispenser. But for most of us, who gives a flying box of bananas? The film successfully treads that fine balance between kids-own-adventure-that-will-sell-gazillions-of-toys and popcorn actioner explosive enough and well scripted enough to have the more discerning set checking in for the ride.Armed with a rudimentary knowledge of the Transformers mythology and an increasingly underwhelming view of modern blockbusters (Spidey 3 and Pirates 3, 300, most other 3's, your number's up), I turned up to the film with low expectations but left eagerly pecking stuff like ""best CGI eva"" and ""Shia's gonna rock it as young Indy"" into my handset.Though not quite perfect: the goofy Sector Seven team dragged the middle act into high camp territory and the hacking team seemed to get totally lost in the flying climax debris, such flaws only mildly tarnished the metallic sheen of a masterpiece of metal-shredding mayhem. Let's face it, who doesn't drool over squadrons of A-10's pounding searing rounds of whatevernium-tipped shells into 50ft robots, it's bloody great.Oh and you may want to start updating all your home cinema components to HDMI. Ultimately, this'll be the DVD that'll get your mates slapping their heads in audio-visual rapture and wishing they could be more like you.Bang for buck behemoth.","Jun 28, 2007",7,/10
"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Autobots, Transform and Roll Out!!!Tonight's movie review is Transformers (2007), yeh the robots which can turns into cars. The flick is made by Mr Explosive Michael Bay and boy did he make an explosive flick. Such a epic movie, where do I begin? First - props to the filmmakers making an epic movie with great characters who at first are all strangers however get together for the finale. Having said that the writers chewed more than they could bite, but I will get back to this later. This flick is mayhem due to the CG-buffed explosions and heaps of buildings and cars getting smashed and destroyed.The film's plot is simple, fate of Earth is in the balance between two alien races from planet Cybertron, the Autobots who are the good guys and Decepticons, the baddies. Both sanctions come to planet Earth to obtain an artifact known as the Allspark, which is unknowingly kept by a teenager who has an eBay account titled Ladiesman217.There are three subplots, one is the military special ops team who come across a Decepticon. This crew has a mix of soldiers including Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson who both do awesome to bring the shoot-em-up action between the three subplots. For example when Duhamel's no bs character Captain Lennox get on a motorbike and rides towards a Decepticon and slides on the ground between the robots legs while shooting the baddie robot - classic and popcorn like entertainment. Plus there are comedic sequences including the Speak English Dude, No Spanish plus the emergency telephone goes through an Indian Telecommunications Sales bloke who requests credit cards details and tries to sell a premium service. The second story is the hacker squad led by Aussie glam Rachel Taylor and funny bloke Anthony Anderson who loves yelling at his grandma and has a sweet tooth with donuts which leads him accusing his co-conspirator being guilty in the interrogation room. These two lead the intelligence side of things in the flick. The final story is Sam Witwicky played by Shia LaBeouf who does really well with his comedic timing with the people he interacts with including love interesting by wowwww Megan Fox, the police officer who questions him about whether he is clear as crystal about how his car just stood up and his highschool mate who likes to climb trees. The best interaction really are his parents Ron and Judy, especially Ron who tricks his kid in buying a Porsche while driving literally through the retail car's entrance and exit path. Then you have John Turturro who plays an agent from Sector 7 and Jon Voight as Secretary of Defence.A lot of character right? There plenty more and as mention the filmmakers chew more than you can eat as some of these character mentioned along with the secondary peeps literally go missing either after the finale or in between the third and final act. This is one of many criticisms of the movie - couldn't execute an epic movie due to diving into other subplots more deeply hence causing a few cut scenes which you can notices by the editing team.Having said that this film was fun and popcorn like entertainment. There is a kid who wants his dream car without his plan going caput and finds his dream car at an old junk card yard. The owner of this establishment is none other than Bernie Mac who plays Bobby B - B like Belize, who loves yelling at Mannyyyy and provides solid advice to Sam, ""a driver don't pick the car, the car picks the driver."" This mystical bond between man and machine is illustrated with Bumblebee, the Camaro Autobot who is both funny and electrifying in this flick who plays old school tracks to spice up the mood between Fox and LaBeouf including Player's Baby Come Back. Sam's dad to me the scene stealer in this flick as the old timer who doesn't like anyone stepping a foot on his garden and fits bumps his kid when he sees Megan Fox in his son's bedroom. The battles on the desert or in the mini city where heaps of skyscrapers get destroyed are fun and enjoyable but of course again heaps of roided special effects. There is a smart Armageddon (yes the movie) reference in the first act of the flick, the Autobots trying to play incognito in Sam's front yard, heaps of slow-mo scenes including the chesty lady in blue and Fox's character Michaela who is soooo hot with her 2000's clothing and freckles...let's get back to the flick, when she tells Bumblebee ""You shoot, I drive"" just gives you chills.Of course, the voices of both the Autobots and Decepticons are also to be commended, especially the master voice man himself Peter Cullen, who voices the leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime. His voice is gold and just gives you that gravity you need of a truck who kicks butt with his built in sword - goosebumps. Hugo Weaving also does an equally & admirable job as Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons. I really enjoyed the dialogue between the two leaders, although I would have liked to see more dialogue of the two between their team factions in order to see more interplay.Overall, a great flick regardless if you are a fan of the cartoon or toys, its just popcorn entertainment. A major flaw is not completing the character scenes as mentioned and the editing as it creates issues with continuity. This takes out the fun of the flick. Having said that go watch it moviegoers - 8/10.","Jun 4, 2021",8,/10

"When this little gem first came out, everyone thought it was a pretty cool little flick. But that's about all.With the benefit of 10 years of hindsight, and keeping in the mind that every successive installment has become progressively worse, we now see this as the pinnacle, the high point, of the franchise.Laboeuf and Fox actually had chemistry. In fact, Fox's career more or less imploded with Jennifer's Body, so in many ways this may be the only work she will leave to the historical record.(Also don't forget Fox's famous scene at the 25:00 mark where she opens the hood of Bumblebee to check out the engine. It has now become iconic. All around the world, millions of young people watching this scene instantly were able to resolve the issue of what their true sexual preference was, no further doubt remained.) It was even nominated for 3 Oscars. Seriously. Kid you not.","Jul 1, 2017",8,/10
"I was, as a youth, deep in the prime years of Transformers. I owned them, I played with them, I watched the show avidly and was 11 years old when the first ""Transformers: The Movie"" came out. It is with some sadness I report that Michael Bay has tarnished my fond memories.The movie had such great potential; the action, art direction, the characters, the powerful themes of humanity and triumph over evil. Bay mangled them all. This movie suffers from many critical flaws which result in it being simply a bad movie. No character development is created for the title characters: The Transformers. We never care about their battle, we simply watch it. This leads to the next problem, with the exception of the Scorponok scene, there is no suspense or interest. Big machines just trade gunfire. If I wanted that I could play the video game - and at least be involved. The action is either too fast to see or in Bay's trademark groan-inducing slow motion. The Transformers take too long to transform, there's way too many moving parts to make it even believable, and the film makers lose track of what they should be doing (telling a story) and instead focus on fancy lighting and excessively complex noise.Please let someone like James Cameron, who can direct technological-oriented films and not lose their heart, direct the sequel.6/10","Jul 10, 2007",6,/10

"(SPOILER ALERT) Transformers was the first Transformers franchise I ever watched! It was an amazing film, and I enjoyed it! The story was really interesting about Sam Witwicky's great grandfather discovered something in the late 1800's that he haven't seen before, Lord Megatron! The autobots however in present time. Find Sam and tells him that they need his grandfather's glasses that were imprinted to a key to retrieve the allspark before the decepticons do!","Sep 29, 2017",8,/10
"Still I can't rate it below 5 stars. If you went for the story, Transformer wouldn't be the best choice -- the structure is loose, I don't understand why Mr Voight would choose to be part of this film, the way the film narrative treated the US govermetn is just a satire -- stupid defensive team, listens to a soldier's opinion. It felt like bits and pieces been put together. I suppose its due to the fact that the film's an adaption from the comic strip. And Sam's parents -- why are they there?! And the omnipresence of the teenagers'-sex-comedy feel really bugs me and makes me laugh. On the other hand, if you went for the visual and sound effects, the film has brought the ""human technology"" up to another level -- which kind of makes me look forward to Harry Potter the 5th actually.Summary : Not satiable.

"Michael Bay is the amalgamation, the collective whole, the personification for everything, the entirety, the complete set of what is wrong with modern day cinema, and still movie goers lap this schmaltz up and make ridiculous claims built from ignorance that films like these are the ""greatest movie of the twenty-first century"" and some even have the gall to claim it ""best movie of all time"". For many I can appreciate that film is entertainment, that it is pure escapism, it's a place where you can sit back, unwind, drink your beverage, scoff your food and turn off your mind for ninety-plus minutes, however for people like myself whilst cinema could and should be entertaining, the entertainment doesn't always have to derive from tripe which can only and from hence forth be described as ""Bay-Mania"".So what does this newly devised term mean? How is it applicable to Transformers? Well in short, I shall explain. Michael Bay is the type of director that produces grade-a cheese on an epic scale and Transformers falls foul of his mature cheddar touch. All of his films, barring possibly the original Bad Boys, have the same generic feel embedded deep within them, where it becomes almost like the Pixar film collection, same story, different animals. So within Transformers the (new) movie, we have the autobots taken from their quaint 1980s setting and placed in the manic action packed world of 2007 as they search for an object which, apparently, holds the fate of the world, and of course those evil decepitcons are after them. The Transformers themselves, well, they're a touch on American muscle side, big, colourful and brash, pretty much everything you'd expect from Bay-Mania. The special effects used for them is pretty staggering and there are some genuine moments of severe coolness emanating from quick-fire transformations which appeal to the kid within all of us, but unfortunately people become too obsessed with the look of a film and not the feel, and herein lies its major fault. Typical Bay-Mania suggests that by sacrificing the storyline for special effects you can 'wow' audiences into an unknowing submission so that they go along for the ride rather than connect. This is atypical for most summer blockbusters, but even the first Spiderman film, and indeed the Batman 'prequel' managed to grasp the audiences attention with character development which made their stories rather unique. When your main protagonists however, are fifty foot mechanical entities whose personalities are predefined by comic book conventions, it's difficult to associate yourselves with them. Also the humans that become further associated with the autobots are far too generic, i.e. nerdish guy who 'believes' in the autobots, attractive female who tags along but has a great deal of knowledge over cars, standard American marine with sense, and politicians and generals without sense. The story meanders along from one 'cool' transformation to the next and eventually builds up into an all out frenzy in which thousands of extras, we daren't use the term people in a Bay-Mania film, are quite literally caught up in this mass free-for-all as one by one they all scream, run around and get trampled on, or hit by huge ten foot tow missiles. It's all harmless computer generated fun, but to be honest, I want more from a film these days. People brandished Spielburgs name around, from his seat in production, citing that he would make sure this would be an ""awesome"" film, but it doesn't work like that these days, as even he succumbs to the sirens call that is the over indulgence in CGI over plot. So what does transformers bring to the film medium? Nothing, not a jot. It's inoffensive fun to a degree, despite all the jaunty unnecessarily confused angles in the fighting sequences, but a mere firework display of a film isn't enough. It's films such as these which have convinced the mainstream movie going masses, that this is acceptable, that this is what we should want to see and what we should aspire to create and critique, and I'm sorry but that's just not acceptable. Michael Bay represents all which is wrong with Hollywood, and that's profit over prolific, money over mesmerising, more revenge of the sith than return of the jedi, and what only infuriates me more is that Hollywood allow him to continue, and now I hear they're going to remake The Birds? No doubt there'll be eagles transforming into giraffes, and needless car chases as the heroes are hunted down by ten foot tall pigeons. I digress from the film at hand but this is what you get from Bay-Mania, unnecessary genericism, and for those that enjoy this film, you're the ones only furthering his narcissism. Autobots...jog on!","Aug 28, 2007",4,/10
"As a kid I didn't know that Transformers is a set of toys. I only used to think that it is an anime series. The first time I learnt about the movies was when one of my friends got a Nexus tablet to school and played this movie when there was no teacher in the class. I really liked the opening scenes and decided that at some point I will watch this movie. Little did I know that the opportunity will come 8 years later when the lockdown would happen. I watched it and enjoyed it very much.Transformers is exactly what I wanted to watch when I used to see the terrible anime. I didn't like optimus Prime very much back then but in this movie I understood why he is so important to the franchise and now I am a huge fan of Optimus Prime. There were so many other Transformers whose names I got to learn as I watched this full staff I used to see this movie in parts on TV and I used to think that Bumblebee was Hotshot. After watching this movie I was feeling like replacing the the logo of my car with the Transformers logo.All the Transformers movies have very good CGI, cinematography, choreography and colour grading. What the other movies lack in, however, is a good story and acting. This movie has all of that. I really wish all the other Transformers movies were also like this. Here I cared about Sam, the army guys and of course, Mikaela (°""U""°). This is one of the only two Transformers movies which actually has a good plot (the other doing bumblebee).If the future Transformers movies had built up on what this movie created they could have actually been very awesome. But instead they focused more on creating a bigger universe with more cars and more merch to sell rather than on character development. I can often come back to watch this movie because of the cool cars and fight scenes, without having any of the cringe the future movies had.","Jul 16, 2021",8,/10
"I have a lot of nostalgia coming from this flim ever since I watched it as a kid. I mean giant robots that could transform into vehicles and planes was just awesome to think about it.Solid story with some minor flaws but was surprisingly thematic at times and had some funny cultural tropes. Though the writing could be a bit cliche and cheesy at times. The characters were decent though they weren't deep or anything they were likable and they had their own quriks and personalites. The visuals is probably the best thing about this flim. The cinematography and the camera work was really good also. The music was decent and the sound choices were lovely especially when the transformers transformed into their main mode.Overall an enjoyable film.

"Okay, I'm pretty much of the generation to which this film is aimed. I was a kid when this show was on the air. I wasn't a huge fan myself, though. I was more of a He-Man kind of guy. I only barely remember watching Transformers. My parents were unwilling to buy me the toys because they were too expensive and they broke easily during their transformations. I really wasn't at all interested in seeing this movie, except maybe on video to see how bad it was. But I'd heard a lot of good word-of-mouth reports and my friends wanted to see it, so I caved in. A one word review: Meh. A little more: it ain't terrible, certainly a lot better than I expected. The film sustains itself with a beleaguered and just plain weird sense of humor that, if not hilarious, is undeniably amusing. In general, there's just too much going on. There are like fifteen different plot threads. The story isn't too hard to follow and mostly makes sense, but a lot of it could be cut out (for instance, the second most important piece of female eye candy, Rachael Taylor, and her hacker buddy played by Anthony Anderson). The action is quite fun most of the time, but the giant final battle has so much going on that it gets more than a little difficult to follow. I might have actually given the movie a passing grade if not for the quick and unsatisfying final battle between Optimus Prime and Megatron. Transformers is pretty close to being worthwhile, but in the end it's too big , exhausting and disappointing to really recommend.","Jul 22, 2007",6,/10

Transformers 2007 is where the movie franchise should have began and ended it had the makings of a good stand alone film but money clearly motivated Michael Bay. That being said this movie is really good sure they changed all the designs for everyone's favorite alien robots but the CGI was really well done for them and they looked really cool. The actors did fine with what they had to work with and that's okay it is still a good movie. Overall I think they should have stuck with the G1 designs because those are what most fans are familiar with but we got that with Bumblebee so I can't complain too much over all good entertainment.,"Apr 1, 2023",9,/10
"I was actually slightly motion sick after leaving this film, so my final impression of it is somewhat marred by that, but overall this was dumb summer fun at its best. I was the right age for the transformer toys, but I never really got into them. However, having played with them is not a prerequisite for enjoying the film.These kind of movies crack me up. They are so obvious in their intentions to traffic in the gut emotions of an audience not used to thinking very critically about what they are watching. This film, like most of Michael Bay's films, is a gussied up military recruitment ad, the kind where all of the soldiers in it are muscled and oily, and where they do a lot of walking toward the camera in emphatic slow motion. There are girls in the film (two of them, to be exact), but they're basically just guys with breasts and nice legs. The government is to be feared and distrusted, because they keep secrets from the American people (like the fact that the Hoover Dam was really built as a facade to hide alien robots and their belongings), while the military is heroic and manly. To make itself feel relevant, the film even throws in some action scenes set in the Middle East.It was refreshing, though, that for once all of the chest-thumping is not reserved solely for the United States, but rather for the human race in general. The message in ""Transformers,"" other than that geeky teenagers have the stuff soldiers are made of, is that the human race isn't so bad after all, even if we have a lot to learn.Grade: A-","Jul 9, 2007",7,/10
"Honestly, was this the best they could do with a huge budget, computer animation for the robots and people like Stephen Spielberg on board? Where do I begin? First the robots... the CGI is neat looking but the robots themselves are over designed and look like they were drawn by Louis Wain. It is very hard to distinguish one transformer from another unless they are changed into a vehicle at the moment, which makes the quick moving battle scenes a confused mess where you sometimes find it hard to know who is on which side.Next, let's tackle the plot. You have a very thin and contrived (not to mention cliché filled) plot which wouldn't even have made a very good comic book story. Very disappointing indeed. They could have come up with something more interesting than a weird cube and a frozen evil robot found by some obscure arctic explorer 100 years ago.Finally let's look at the characters and their interaction and development. For the transformers themselves, you know very little other than they are robots and the some are good, some are evil. Some turn into cars, others into tanks or jets. You get no background on them at all and unless you have seen the 80's cartoons, you have no idea who they are and you really don't get to know these characters during the movie. While many people might remember them from the 80's cartoons, a little more background would be nice for the younger generation who missed out on the 80's altogether.As for the main human characters, there is little to redeem them. They are poorly acted and are mainly there to scream and tremble as robots battle around them and destroy the city they live in. Sam is a complete loser who is sadly trying to win the heart of a girl (Mikaela) who is way out of his league and looks more like someone who constructed in a plastic surgeons office than a real girl. Why does every movie today involve a couple who is either separated and hate each other or in hopeless crush situation that you know will not last past the adventure? You just don't have normal kids in films anymore (though Sam comes the closest). The are either super crackers who can break into the pentagon while typing with their toes, modified to look like pageant models or have some mysterious figure in their family history that destines them for some great adventure.The movie is poorly executed with CGI battles one moment and a sickening crush on the hot girl scene the next. The characters are shallow and have few it any redeeming qualities to them. You find yourself wishing they would get killed no matter who comes out the winner among the robots just so you didn't have to put up with the slow and boring scenes of the boy trying to make it with the plastic girl. In the end the movie becomes just one big smash fest, which while fun to watch, is ruined by the length of time spent griping about how annoying the human characters are. Once the real action starts, you are just ready for this crap bomb to be over. 1 star, and that is because they had so much potential and came up with such an empty movie in the end.","Oct 26, 2007",1,/10
"Since the new Transformers movie is coming out soon, I thought I would re-watch some of the old ones. I had forgotten how awesome the first Transformers was. I hope Transformers 4: The Age of Extinction is at least AS cool as this movie. Some people rip on this movie because it is too impossible. The only thing I have to say to that is it is not supposed to be realistic. If there is a movie that has giant robots that can transform into cars and planes and trucks and back again, you should automatically know it isn't going to be realistic. But once you get past that, it truly is an awesome movie. The special effects were amazing, considering that the movie was made 7 years ago. The special effects people really did an amazing job on this movie. In fact, they paid so much attention to detail, they even made the Transformers blink, move their teeth, and even breathe, I think. However, because they were robots, it was hard to read their emotions. That doesn't bother me, though. The acting was also great. It was a good idea to have the Transformers have different styles of talking and behaving. In a way that made them seem a little bit more human, and you feel sympathetic for them when one dies or gets hurt or injured. The actual humans in the movie were very believable characters, and you feel for them as well. Everyone in the movie did a very good job, and kept the movie fun to watch. I always look for that in a movie. The story was somewhat taken from the 1984-1987 TV series, but it was still kept original in some ways. I haven't seen the series, so I can't really expound on that. Sorry. Although, the story was kept very entertaining by the writers, and there were only one or two dull moments. Michael Bay did a wonderful job directing this movie, but there was one thing I had a problem with. I don't know if it was his idea or the cinematographer's idea, but the camera was way too shaky in some of the battle scenes. There was too much going on to have a shaky camera like that, and that is the reason I give it an 8/10, because there is way too much of it. But if you are OK with shaky cameras, you will enjoy this movie 100%. Probably. Hopefully. Maybe. You might. Anyway, the dialogue was good, too. There were no bad jokes, no dull speeches, and nothing else of that sort. That's really all I have to say. I hope you found my review helpful, and feel free to check out my other reviews. See ya!","Jun 8, 2014",8,/10
"While the film caters to an audience of teenage boys, it was quite entertaining for the whole family. The visual experience is like nothing else. The CG transformers blend flawlessly with the natural environment and the actors making it enjoyable even for adults. Because the film relies so heavily on CG the action sequences are a bit hard to follow because of there detail and speed making it difficult to really see what happening, especially if you see this film in a theater not using digital projection technology.The story is fun, and the humor is appropriate for all ages. The film solves the problem of what to watch when Dad wants to see ""Die Hard"", and Kids want ""Ratatoille"", sorry mom...""Evening"" is next door.","Jul 6, 2007",7,/10
"Pardon me if this review comes out as somewhat unorganized. It's just that all of my thoughts are currently jumbling together because of how bad this movie really is.This is by far the worst movie of the year. It's bad, even for Michael Bay. Whoever said earlier that the action shots were full of too many zooms, kudos to them because they are right on the money. My friend nearly puked a little when they played music from ""Kill Bill Vol 1"" in it. Another problem I had with it was that it kept changing from day to night at random when it was obviously a continuation of the same scene. John Turturro was highly miscast in the movie, as well as Jon Voit. Please, don't waste your time. It's awful. It makes me ashamed to be an American. ""The Triumph of Will"" was a Nazi propaganda movie that brainwashed millions of people into believing that the Nazi's were fighting for a just cause; that's still not half as bad as ""transformers."" I even refuse to capitalize ""transformers"" because it is so rotten.PS - QUIT RATING THE MOVIE TEN STARS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!!!!","Jul 1, 2007",1,/10
"This movie is a great guilty pleasure. Dumb, noisy, sexist... yes. But oh quite so watchable if you just enjoy it for what it is.Great music, fun characters, human and machine. There are some cringe-worthy moments but overall, it's just a blast.Do not watch if too woke. Otherwise, enjoy it.Can't say any of the sequels did anything for me but the first one is awesome in its humor and even, a touch of pathos.","Jan 19, 2021",9,/10
"This film was a disaster. A mess. Unwatchable. The worst direction of a movie since the Island. I don't know what I enjoyed less, this or the Star Wars prequels.The script was non existent. Confusing--stupid. Not even the writers of the cartoon show would have stooped to a level as mentally challenged as this. It wasn't even tongue in cheek or camp. It was just bad writing. Shame on the screenwriters--though is suspect the director had a lot to do with it so let me save my venom for him...The fx: yes the compositing of cg into live action was very good--not as impressive as Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean but still very good. Unfortunately, the direction was so rotten as to spoil the sense of awe you might have expected from it and the fx sequences. For one thing--these 10 ton machines ran around like..well, 8 inch toys. They were hiding under bridges, stumbling through backyards without making impact tremors, basically reduced to a joke. Truly. There were very few moments where they behaved like actual gigantic machines. But who cares right? Its fantasy. OK well then give me great action sequences. But they weren't great. They were confusing and poorly edited--so much so you could hardly stay focused on the action.This is why Michael Bay deserves a kick between the legs for being such a failure as a storyteller. Above all its his fault(and Spielberg's for urging him to do it.). If I go to see a movie about giant fx monsters, I expect bad writing, even bad acting, but I want to see cool action scenes if nothing else. But he directed them like he did the Island, confusing, choppy, constantly moving cameras that didn't focus on the characters long enough to stay absorbed in the moment of the story.The only irony in the film is that when i heard about it I thought it was like Small Soldiers in reverse, so it was amusing for half a second to see the father from that movie playing the same role in this one. Small Soldiers was a much better movie.Masters of the Universe 87 was a better movie. The animated cartoon movie better (and that is saying a lot). I actually wish it was as good as the first Jurassic Park--which had a lame story and weak dialogue--even that was genius next to this.Its a shame someone like Paul Verhoeven couldn't have made this--he knew how to do an action sequence and if he was going to throw humor in it would have been more sophisticatedI give the film 2 points. 1 for the fx and the 1 for the casting of Cullen as Optimus Prime (even though his design was an eyesore and he didn't behave in a very dignified fashion).I read somewhere that Bay used to work for George Lucas and when he heard about Raiders of the Lost Ark he dismissed it as a ""toy movie."" Well Bay really showed that he knows how to make a movie as if he was a 3 year old playing with a camera. This was one truly infantile movie.A big budget Hollywood movie at its worst.","Dec 16, 2007",,
"When I first heard that Transformers was going to become a live action movie my first thought was ""Oh no, How will they ruin this one?"" After seeing the trailers i decided to go see and was extremely surprised. The story/action ratio stayed in a good range with just enough story to keep the movie entertaining and enough action to keep you wanting more.Though I have to say some of the plot holes can easily be overlooked, some just stand out. Not downing the movie just the people who made it. I have to say the characters were done so well I almost believed that they were real and not just CG. Bring back the original voice of Optimus Prime just sent this movie over the top. I highly recommend seeing it if you haven't already. Its not as bad as the other reviews show it to be.","Jul 6, 2007",7,/10
"I feel very sorry for those many people who jumped on the bandwagon of hatred towards this series and forget how outright enjoyable the first movie really is.A simple story of a boy getting his first car, only to discover his car is an advanced alien robot in disguise! He finds himself caught in the middle of an intergalatic civil war between the noble Autobots and merciless Decepticons, and Earth becomes the battlefield.When Michael Bay stepped up to direct the first live action interpretation of the 1980s cult cartoon Transformers (yes, I use the word ""cult"" specifically) there were some groans and doubts. But think about it, what does he do best? Explosions and cars. What does Transformers constitute of? Explosions and cars. Under the executive producer eyes of Steven Spielberg and Dreamworks Studios, Bay's outright silliness is restrained and this film actually feels structured. This comes from some decent acting from/direction of Shia LeBeouf as Sam, regular boy who wants to win the affection of Megan Fox's Mikaela. It takes a good forty minutes before the action takes off and our planet is bombarded with thirty-foot tall talking robots. As a fan, my inner child was (and still does) itch with anticipation! This is the Transformers mandate, heck it is in their motto: Robots in Disguise! We see Bumblebee, Sam's guardian, as a regular car... the film knowingly holds off showing us transformations for as long as possible. This makes the reveal of all the others, especially childhood cartoon hero Optimus Prime, incredible to see!You have to understand. As a kid this sort of thing, showing real life Transformers, was only a thing of dreams, the technology wasn't here until this movie. This film glorifies the act of these regular vehicles changing shape and continuing on their way. I still get some chills as Starscream swings around, leaping into the air and transforms.Another thing this film achieved is often overlooked now. It was a massive success. I mean a massive success. Not only was it nominated for Academy Awards for special effects (and was robbed in broad daylight, The Golden Compass, seriously?!?) but Transformers was always a geeky, disrespected cartoon even at its height (sorry fandom, but it was) and this film broadened the franchise's influence tenfold. Everybody loved Bumblebee, for example, and learned how people like me respected Optimus Prime as a character. It was wonderful! So many newformed fans appearing everywhere. Even my sister enjoyed it! If you are one of these people and in denial of your initial feelings towards this film, I feel very sorry for you. There is a huge number of fickle-minded people out there.Is it perfect? No. Michael Bay still has some influence, though not a great deal, and there are a handful of human characters who do not belong. The story takes unnecessary detours and bypasses just to include human characters who could have been cut completely to make a sharper film. Does it detract from the film as a whole? No. Yes, there are suspensions of disbelief, yes it is silly and the climax is a myriad of explosions but honestly! This is Transformers! For a first try at making something so ridiculous as this cartoon a living, breathing film, this hits it out of the park and lays a good foundation for improvement. Sadly, for this film (not unlike The Matrix) its sequels do their best to avoid improvement...It is a fun, entertaining action romp. Exactly what Transformers was and should forever be.","Jul 12, 2014",9,/10
"A special military outpost detects an aircraft that's way off course. Two leaders on the team, Sergeant Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Tech Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are present with the troops to greet the aircraft, which by military record, crashed and burned some time ago. All havoc breaks loose when this aircraft reveals itself not to be what it appears. When most of their unit is wiped out in the resulting assault, the sergeants are less concerned about making a report to superiors and more concerned with making it home with the other survivors in one piece. Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet, fast-talking high-schooler Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBouf--in just about every movie this year) is prepared for an important rite of passage. His dad Ron (Kevin Dunn) has agreed to buy Sam his first car. However, Sam somehow settles on a beat-up yellow Camaro, not realizing that there's--ahem, ""more than meets the eye"" to this car.Okay, let me start by saying that this is very much a Michael Bay film--and as such, we know what to expect. (See the title) Grand doses of horrendous dialogue. Extreme twists in logic. Editing that would make most of us run screaming to the nearest kung-fu flick. That's all here, but it's far from the point. THIS is a summer movie in the way we've come to expect! High action, incredible pacing, and way cool music played very loudly. Bay channels a little David Zucker as well--there's some dead-on, rapid-fire humor that's actually funny! Note Lennox's frustration as he runs across tech support in India in his attempt to contact Washington. The one-liners we'd expect from him are also accounted for, but he has wisely stocked the cast with a who's-who of expert one-liner delivery personnel. (LeBouf, Gibson, Anthony Anderson, and John Tuturro to name a few.) Of course, the center piece of the film is the Transformers themselves, who are a sight to behold. I grew up on every incarnation, from TMS to Sunbow to Mainframe and beyond; and while I'd often say ""That's cool"", I knew in my brain of brains there was no way to make me believe cars and planes were capable of such transformations. Now Digital Domain has shaken hands with Industrial Light and Magic and...well...let's just say I'm now in the market for a car, and I'm going to scrutinize those puppies VERY closely. You needn't be a fan, you just need a desire for solid summer diversion. If that's what you want, roll on out.","Jul 3, 2007",7,/10

"Since this film is directed by Michael Bay, I went in expecting it to be terrible. And it wasn't terrible. Just sloppy.The strongest element of this film was the story line. The pacing is very nice, and with the exception of the opening sequence dragging on a bit, the film flowed exceptionally well. Unfortunately there were many flaws in the script that really brought down the quality of the film. The most noticeable problem was the dialogue. You have to feel bad for actors when they are given lines drawn from a hat, which get used over and over again, and have to make them come out naturally. A lot of the dialogue seemed forced and unnecessary. Many of these lines could be simply cut, for the words say things that we already understand the characters are thinking or feeling. There were also secondary plot lines that were introduced and not sufficiently wrapped up. The stories of some characters were left up in the air.The characters also were greatly underdeveloped. The only human character who the audience begins to care about is Sam (Shia LaBeouf). Everyone else is, simply put, just there to push a wheel-barrel. The Transformers draw more sympathy from the audience, which may or may not have been the intention of the filmmakers.Shia LaBeouf does stand out among the cast. He has a great deal of talent and is excellent in the film, considering what the script gave him to work with. Hopefully this will open the door for him to do some really promising work in future films.Anyone who studies film knows about the reputation of director Michael Bay. He has a knack for being flashy, focusing all of his attention on the look of the film. In this film, he continues to show that he has a hard time giving actors helpful direction, as well utilizing an effective array of shot selections. He seems to not understand the idea of motivated shot selection, where the tone of the scene dictates what shot should be used. Not every angle of a character needs to be a close-up, which Bay always overuses. This is unfortunate, because if he could have progressed his directing skills, this film could have been very special. But with so much attention on creating a flashy, CGI driven spectacular, a good story was left misunderstood.As for the special effects, a lot of effort went into creating the Transformers and the action sequences. It does look very nice, but in my opinion, the CGI seemed to be a crutch to hide otherwise poor cinematography and principle photography. The images seem to detract eyes from very unrealistic lighting. There was also a noticeable discrepancy between the CGI and effects done in photography (i.e. some explosions, debris, etc). The filmmakers obviously could not destroy downtown Los Angeles, but it seems very clear that the structures were in a completely different layer from the CGI. Maybe I am a stickler, but this made the film seem even more sloppy to me. The impression is that principle photography was rushed just so the robots could steal the show in the end.But technical stuff aside, the film is largely enjoyable. There is a great deal of humor (some fitting, some pointless) to keep the audience entertained during the ""slow"" portions of the film. And like I said earlier, the storyline keeps the audience at attention as well. And as far as epic Science Fiction films go, Transformers is able to stand the test of time. The idea of aliens being at war with aliens, and Earth is caught in the crossfire, is an idea that has not been exhausted like many sci-fi themes. It is a fresh take on the ""interstellar war"" story.To conclude, the average movie-goer will likely enjoy this film at face value. Those with a more intense eye in film making will undoubtedly have a lot of criticism. But for me, this was at least the most enjoyable film by Michael Bay thus far, and I have to say that I am glad that I saw it.","Jul 14, 2007",7,/10
"Spider-Man 3, Pirates 3, and Fantastic Four 2 were all terrible, but in comparison to Transformers they are each a Citizen Cane. Transformers is a cinematic Hindenburg.Let's review what this movie presents us with. Stereotypes: two sassy black grandmas; an Hispanic whose Spanish annoys the WASPs; a dumb, aggressive high school jock; the transformer named Jazz is presented as an American black (jazz music = black, apparently).Cheap, sophomoric humor: teenage masturbation; dog peeing on transformer; transformer peeing on man; ""can I ride you home"" instead of ""can I give you a ride home."" The plot, if that's even what it is, casts doubt in my mind that the movie's writer has a cerebral yield greater than a house plant.This movie is almost as grating on my soul as Superman Returns.","Jul 6, 2007",1,/10
"In 2007, there was a movie that premiered on July 3rd, 2007 in theaters. This movie was Transformers. It was the first live-action film made since the animated series in the 80's. The director is Michael Bay, who previously worked on films such as Bad Boys.The story is the Autobots and Decepticons are searching for an artifact called the Allspark that will save their planet. The Autobots wish to restore their world Cybertron while the Decepticons wish to destroy Earth. Humans are left in the middle of this. Bay had a view in mind for this first film, and it was big explosions, eye candy and superb CGI for the Transformers.The characters introduced in this first one are Shia Labeouf, well known for that kids TV show Even Stevens and Holes. The eye candy is the gorgeous Megan Fox, who I had not heard much of until this movie. Josh Duhamel plays the commander of a group of survivors after a base attack. Another cool thing is Peter Cullen, who was in the animated series voicing Optimus Prime, reprises his role again as Prime.The acting is very good and the background characters like Shia's parents create a sense of humor that will have people laughing every time they appear on screen.What makes this movie great is the Transformers themselves. Bay focused a lot of his time to them and did an amazing job with their transforming.Transformers is an amazing start to the franchise and does follow up to several sequels which I will do reviews for as well. Definitely everyone should give this a chance especially if you were a fan of the animated series like me. Check it out.","Jul 9, 2014",9,/10
"You get the impression that the word ""cool"" was uttered many times during the making of Michael Bay's port of the TRANSFORMERS TV cartoon to the silver screen. After seeing the trailer a few times before other features and reading some reviews, I'd have to say my expectations were met. I saw it with Code Monkey (ex-work) and Ken (work) at Hoyts Melbourne Central. We grabbed some pints of beer at the Lion beforehand, during which Code Monkey revealed the Transformers T-shirt lurking beneath his office attire. That was a funny moment  in a good way or bad way, Ken and I aren't so sure yet.On to the movie itself, well, there is a lot of CGI animation that is too fast and busy for its own good. Often I couldn't figure out what was going on because the action was just too fast and choppy, thus defeating the purpose you'd think. Code Monkey explained his theory on this syndrome to me on the train coming home and it seemed plausible enough: audiences are not given enough time to analyse the action and perhaps see flaws, so they just assume it kinda makes sense. Whatever the deal is, you know by now it's a pet hate of mine. It is a pity, because in many sequences the animation and special effects really are convincing, even beautiful. The story and characters are more problematic. For starters, TRANSFORMERS takes a long time to get going. Related to that point, we don't hear the Transformers themselves talk until the half way point or later. From then on the narrative flows better, since the machines take on actual personalities, albeit totally one dimensional, but at least we get some motivation and basic exposition. Then again, the interactions between the humans and the robots suddenly becomes awkward, plus you have ridiculous moments where massive hulking killer robots can't snatch a little box off a wussy teenager who is more than likely still a virgin, fer chrissakes.As with most of Michael Bay's movies, some of the supporting characters (human and non-human) are amusing. And once again for Bay, his military types are for the most part cardboard cutouts: either steroidal Neandertals, humourless top brass, or lovable rouges. Also, this is yet another action picture that depicts violent scenes but avoids any bloodshed or one-screen deaths  any nastiness is rapidly blurred from sight by something computer generated flying past. So there it is. Heavy on spectacle, light on logic, with a few chuckles, and some female eye candy to enjoy for the blokes. A bit more restraint (or less caffeine, speed, cocaine, steroids) on Michael Bay's part could have turned this into a great blockbuster. Oh well. Bring on DIE HARD 4.0, which was apparently censored before release. Why bother at all if it's not going out with a US R, like the previous three DH movies? Don't get me started.","Jul 11, 2007",6,/10
"Well, as a long time IMDb user, I've always come here for generally fair and even reviews on films. Normally you get the general ups and downs reviews and I find most movie web pages give an accurate representation of what to expect. However, after anticipating this movie greatly, and seeing the rave reviews on IMDb, I eagerly set out to the movie theater with a few friends.I could barely contain my laughter during the most serious parts of this film. Never have I seen a plot so butchered by poor directing, and even WORSE dialog. There were two aspects of this film that I liked: 1) The transformations. Watching the robots morph back and forth between vehicle and killing machine was absolutely incredible. The CGI was impressive. 2) Shia Labueff gave a very good performance.The rest of the film was awful. The plot is filled with holes. And the never-ending unnecessary small plots are confusing, unnecessary, and often left unfinished. The action sequences were always on the BRINK of being cool, but then would stop or cut away before you saw anything. The robots fighting to closely to actually see the reality of what they were doing to each other, and the needless shrapnel, smoke, and fire often obscured what could have been some epic fights. The needless plugs for BOTH political parties and views on Iraq, and one for one of Bay's own films were disgusting. Characters whom play significant roles rarely are given a name, and only 1 of the transformers(prime himself) has anything beyond a three scentence dialog. Most simply shout things like ""Want of piece of me!"" or ""I wanna blast him!"" However, if I had to sum up this movie in one word it would be Cliché. Bay manages to use EVER cliché I could imagine. They range from the clichéd high school movie: a 27 year old high school juniors who is a jerk to his girlfriend; A sociology teacher who doesn't like his job; an eccentric mother who says awkward things in front of her son. To the flag waving army movie involving marines who ""just want to see their daughter for the first time,"" or like to ""remember weekends,"" to whom 'losing isn't an option.' All the way down to the stereotypical overweight African American, who shouts things like ""stay of my gramamas floor,"" and enjoys eating donuts. The list goes ON AND ON AND ON.So, I IMPLORE you, wait until this film is out on video to see it. Save your 10 dollars. At least then you can watch the cool transformations over and over again and skip the rest of the movie.","Jul 6, 2007",3,/10

"Personally, I give Transformers a rating of 7.8 -- high enough for a movie that is intended to entertain. Michael Bay's shortcomings persist, but it's still well worth the admission.Best plot layouts and dialogs are within the 1st hour, most of which I doubt are Spielberg' efforts, not those of Michael Bay (MB for short). Top-class sitcom jokes except the Chris Rock-like cliché performed by Antony Anderson.The quality goes downhill from where good robots hide from the parents. Lengthy, repetitious, with too few punchlines.In the fight in the last third of the movie, MB's usual weaknesses go abound.Superfluous, childish heart-warming dialogs and background music (reminds you of Peal Harbor. Did MB read too many ""Washington cut the cherry tree"" stories?). Contrary to the 1st hour, multi-threaded plot lines begin to scatter here and there. And don't forget the meaningless slow motion takes.But this part edges out in special effects. The ensemble is not too sloppy, compared with camera manipulation of his previous works.As a whole, it's a must see, but leaves a lot of room too improve.To me, MB is a 2nd-class director. There's must be something missing in his character,unable to judge ""what's to be left and left out in movie composition."" I wish this film would have been directed by James Cameron, Steven Spielber, Tony Scott,or even Ang Lee. MB probably will never be on the same level of the above-mentioned great directors.","Jun 29, 2007",,

"In all honesty, I completely forgot how epic and perfect of an action/sci-fi this movie was. I'm not a huge Micheal Bay fan yet this movie wouldn't have been the same without the madman. Every mechanical lash, every technological pulse fed that little destruction craving demon inside from chaotic (and momentarily perplexing) yet captivating action pieces featuring flawless CGI that crossed the line between digitally animated creatures and pure flesh made man. Shia Labeouf performance was ultimately scary for how exceptionally realistic and convincing he built the character of Sam. Furthermore, every role was perfectly acted; both actors and actresses actualized a plethora of characters whom felt formerly grounded in this world before the plot called for their aid. In light of this, the dialogue was creepily faultless and featured the naturalism that comes in arguments, fearful conversation and disagreeable banter. Moreover, the comedy was on point and didn't try to be anything it wasn't, withal it depicted the messy reality which is humor between several voices. The pacing this movie planted was endlessly aggressive with little to no breathing room but it was brilliant; assisting the 'end of the world' concept to a near perfect standard and always keeping the audience on their feet with no blunt moments. In pair with the stunning, picturesk visuals delivered from the anamorphic lenses, Steve Jablonsky's godlike score conquered the science fiction aspect this movie so desperately reached for and undoubtedly achieved. However, not to be fooled, this movie featured a wide variety of plot holes and awkward tangles that tears from the piece of art it is. My biggest gripe being Sam's and Makaela's underdeveloped relationship that required only a fraction more screen time to further captivate. Nevertheless, in combination with all it did well, especially with the addition of the astronomically incredible, jaw-dropping sound design; Transformers is a perfect action/sci-fi flick that everyone needs to watch before they die!","Apr 2, 2020",9,/10

"I'm an 80s kid and almost everybody I know was excited about this movie coming out. Who doesn't love giant fighting robots? Michael Bay's website has an awesome t-shirt available, it's black and says on the front ""Giant F-king Robots are Coming."" A movie like that doesn't even really need a script.What it needs is one single minded direction in all aspects of all movie production and promotion. Based on what I saw from the previews, I thought it was going to be a revamp of a cartoon, shooting for the 13-31 male demographic with lots of action to boot. With that it mind it did an excellent job updating the look of the transformers and the way they fought to satisfy anybody with ""OMG Giant Fighting Robots"" in mind when they walked into the theater.However, as I was enjoying this movie I kept on being slammed back to earth by unnatural dialog, weak character motivations, and a superficial character arc. Some of the scenes stuck me as odd and conflicting while watching it, but it didn't hit me until afterwards that the script wasn't bad, it was just meant for kids. If you're looking for the next Terminator 2 this isn't it. Every character has one purpose and is obviously striving to get it once it has been narrated to the audience. This is summed up perfectly when Sam (Shia) says ""Okay, I got a car, now all I need is a girl"" or something to that effect.I have also heard people complain about John Turturro's character pointlessness within the movie and must agree that he is pointless within a ""grown-ups"" script. Almost every single kids movie has some good character in authority who impedes progress of the protagonist for really no reason and eventually comes around. It is someone that needs no explanation to kids because they already know what's gonna happen and what that character is about even though it made me feel unsatisfied.Same thing can be said about robot hiding scene. The silly humor there in definitely reminds me of characters in an animated children's film, especially so with the ""lubricating"" scene. While the scene is overly long for my tastes it would be an important scene in a kids script helping them to identify who are good guys and bad guys almost immediately.This movie is not bad, and definitely has some action sequences worth seeing on a bigger screen. If you're looking for well polished script that has intriguing characters to back up that action you'll find it lacking. I gave it a 6/10 for what I was expecting, though I think if it had been pitched as more of a kids movie through the trailer and buzz I would have been able to overlook what I didn't and enjoyed it more.","Jul 5, 2007",6,/10

"I'm always a bit on the defensive when it comes to making movies about things i remember from my childhood. Mostly i guess because my memories are probably not that accurate, and in the case of ""Transformers"" i was also mostly interested in the toys and not so much the comics. What made me watch this was mostly the fact that a lot of things were actually changed from the ""old"" Transformers. Especially the look was completely different, and i guess more adapted to live action as opposed to the cartoon-look.And what did i think? Well, after watching this movie i was happy i did. I have always been a bit of a sucker when it comes to really nice-looking movies, and this is definitely one of those. It's no surprise though since it's Bruckheimer behind the wheel. He might be about as subtle as an earthquake, but he does deliver the goods when it comes to high-octane action. And it doesn't get much more high-octane than huge robots fighting it out in the middle of a city. Also Bruckheimer has started to get his stuff together now. Previously i thought he was probably the worst budget-waster in Hollywood. And i guess in a way it's true, but he still seems to get a lot more out of his money today than a few years ago. The 150 million dollars they sunk into ""Tranformers"" gave them what is arguably the best special effects i have ever seen in a movie. And as far as blowing money goes, that is a decent deal.And what about the rest of the movie? Well, i guess that is where you might object. Aside from the effects there isn't much of a movie left. There is a little love story here which is cute in a ""80's high-school-movie""-way, but other than that it's mostly just action all the way. And lousy comedy. That was my main complaint with this movie actually, the lousy comedy. There is in particular one scene that shames the whole movie. It's the lowest form of silly comedy with huge robots reduced to clowns. A real mood-breaker to say the least. Also one of the robots has clear Jar-Jar Binks-tendencies with silly noises and moves.In the end though this movie is all about the robots, huge ones. They fight, they transform and they talk and scream with deep voices. There are a few truly huge scenes here, not least the battle scenes in the desert in the beginning of the movie. I would have liked more time with Starscream and a deeper story, perhaps based more on the comic. But in the end this is a huge blockbuster the way one of those are supposed to be. And as long as you don't think too hard about it, it's mindless entertainment at one of it's best.7/10.","Oct 17, 2007",7,/10
"Look, I enjoy a silly sci-fi film as much as the next man, but this film was just terrible. There really is nothing else that can be said.BUT, seeing as IMDb insist on at least ten lines before comments can be posted, here is a list of the problems with this film:1. the script - George W. Bush might have done better;2. the acting - about as convincing as an Irish politician;3. the plot - again, Dubya might have had a hand in it;4. the product placement - Cringe McCringe with extra cringe; and5. the length - incredibly, the editors could not shorten this film, despite most of it being unnecessary fluff.......just like everything after the second line of this review.","Oct 30, 2007",1,/10
"This loud, explosive live-action adaptation of Hasbro's popular toy franchise powerfully represents the signature big-budget filmmaking methodology of Michael Bay. It is 144 minutes of loud explosions and heavy metal-on-metal mayhem compiled in a dumb popcorn movie deluxe. Upon sitting through the hour mark, it is clear that Bay does not intend on engaging viewers at an intellectual level. That does not meant this film aborts on deliver an enormous amount of fun. Produced by Dreamworks and Paramount Pictures, This bombastic science-fiction piece sees Michael Bay operating on his trademark visual style, pumping the adrenaline-fueled testosterone through over-the-top explosions and brisk pacing. The outcome is a wild ride flowing with just enough to distract from the sporadically clumsily narrative. This film follows 17-year old Sam Witwicky (played by Shia Labeouf), a high student junior who is surprised with a 1979 Chevrolet Camaro by his father (played by Kevin Dunn). What the young man doesn't know is that the car is an autobot in disguise. When the car morphs into the giant Autobot, Sam and his beautiful crush Mikaela (played by Megan Fox) find themselves into in between a war between the Autobots lead by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) and the Decepticons who are in pursuit of a mysterious cube known as the Allspark, a powerful cube capable opening up a world the afterlife of both the Autobots and the Decepticons. In the process, they must escape from the suspicious law enforcement officials led by Agent Simmons (played by John Turturro).With Michael Bay behind the steering wheel, this movie discards from the elements of the 1986 animated movie, with the first one being the feature of human characters put into the others. The second being considerably less kid-friendly than what long-time fans have been devoted to. This movie takes the violent robot-on-robot action and cranks up a notch in a noisy, explosion-laden galore; in addition to some teen-oriented humor. Nevertheless, Bay knows how to deliver the fun and fulfill the promises of rambunctious action set pieces -- and there is plenty of it. Building are crumbled to pieces, cars are flipped over, and the streets are littered with robotic debris showering everywhere. These sequences are the biggest attractions to this bombastic thrill ride, and manage to stand above all other aspects, particularly the plot. Surrounding the plot involving a hot conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons is a slew of subplots that at times put the story in a little topsy turvy, one involving the government agency pursuing after Sam and Mikaela for questioning on the whole giant robot chaos, another involving Rachel Taylor and Anthony Anderson in which makes very little sense. Above all, the best thing the writer give the story is that it at least make somewhat sense. But for those who just come in for the action and visual grandeur, the story may likely be the least of their concern. As for the acting department, Shia Labeouf is okay in the role of Sam Witwicky, swarming with cheeky humor and humility. Megan Fox on the other hand, stands out more for serving as eye candy with her sex appeal than for her performance. With frequent lingering shots of her body, this film holds very little restraints for sexualizing her, for better or worse. John Turturro has a few odd laughs in his scenes, but nothing that is likely to raise the eyebrows. Transformers is an explosive action thrill ride bound to please not only fans who grew up with the popular toy franchise (or TV shows), but also most certainly those hungry for a near-two hours some heavy special-effects mayhem. It is loud, it is feverishly energetic, but most importantly, it is a whole of fun.","Jun 15, 2017",8,/10
"If you want a short review of Transformers here it is: it's a loud, badly written disjointed mess of a movie with a nonsensical plot that ruins yet another potentially good franchise.So what? Well that's pretty much Michael Bay's reaction. If you read his biography page he defends himself in two ways which I'd like to address in relation to this movie.He's made a lot of money. That's his first point. Well, yes but you'll notice that most artistic people don't make a huge amount of money and when they do they generally don't see that as being their primary motivation. This movie has made a lot of money from 13 year old kids because that is who Hollywood markets their films to. In fact if you spend enough on marketing it's virtually impossible to lose money on a film, though obviously it does happen from time to time. If you went to the cinema ten years ago you'd see people of all ages enjoying the spectacle of the big screen. Now you only see kids and their weary looking parents because there's virtually nothing for a discerning adult to enjoy. This brings us to point two of this hacks justification for creating drivel like this.I make movies for 13 year old kids - big deal! Yeah, in fact it is a big deal because takings are now down 20% and it's part of a consistent pattern over the past ten years or so. The more you alienate the adult market by making crappy PG13 guff like this the narrower the market becomes and the more you have to pander to their taste.People like Micheal Bay are poisoning Hollywood for everyone and if people disagree bear in mind that you aren't 13 forever, your taste will become more complex and there will be literally nothing to see at the cinema. Hollywood would like to pretend that their abysmal takings are down to piracy of their product and to some extent I'm sure that's true, but the main reason is that the films on offer are generally awful and if you get stung by a few utterly awful movies in a row you have little motivation to keep going to the cinema.In short he's an idiot and so are the people who only see cinema as a financial concern. It's an art form, we go to see art and this is about as far from art as you can get. It's not even financially viable in the long term because the people most likely to pirate movies are teenagers. In short, it's moronic crap like this that is killing cinema.","Jun 3, 2010",,
"First of all, the movie was not bad. It was a little slow in the beginning. The special effects were all pretty much in the previews. What I didn't understand, was why Herbert Hoover was brought into the storyline? Did Michael Bay stop to realize that we didn't have the technology to move Megatron from the South Pole to the United States in those days? Heck, airplanes barely existed. Also, what is the deal with that City that the battle took place in? It sure as heck wasn't Las Vegas, Nevada! If you go from Phoenix to Las Vegas you go right THROUGH Hoover Dam. Also, remember when the Decepticon's activated and said ""All Hail Megatron!""? It seemed like only 10 minutes before they all DROVE from various parts of the globe and ended up at Hoover Dam. Shame on you Michael Bay! You should have used shots of Las Vegas if you were going to use the CITY as a battleground just out of Hoover Dam!","Jul 15, 2007",6,/10
Well usually I am though to impress but i say this movie is a really great movie and the director Michael Bay is a guineas. first i like to begin with the graphics. The graphics on this movie are incredible i love the way the people interact with the robots is incredible and also the way the robots transform into vehicles is really amazing. Now the duration time the movie is a pretty long movie the movie storyline keeps you occupied so u cant even tell that the movie is long well overall i give this movie a 10 and that it was the best movie for the year of 2007 and i hope that the sequel is going to be great as well this movie is the best.,"Aug 17, 2008",10,/10
"first of all, i would just like to say this could very well be the WORST movie made in 2007. EVERYTHING (well, almost everything) was complete crap: the horrible - HORRIBLE script (ex- the extremely painful scene in the boy's bedroom, with topics ranging from masturbation to a random hot girl), shitty acting from EVERY actor!, the stupid celeb cameos which ended up detracting from the movie, etc...however, were it not for the BEAUTIFUL - GLORIOUS - STUNNING CGI visual effects, i would have given this movie a 1. sorry - it just didn't strike a chord in me - i'm honestly confused as to why it received such a high rating among fans!but back to the effects... i haven't seen the golden compass yet but its effects must have been a gift from god for them to have won the Oscar! (i'm sure they're not and i bet money transformers had better effects. i think the problem in the end is that the movie in general was so darn bad. at least the golden compass was a movie based on a popular book and didn't make everyone want to throw up in their seats)that's about all - i hope if you haven't seen the movie yet - you don't... unless you want to see one computer-generated miracle after the next","Mar 5, 2008",6,/10
"I watched the original cartoons as child in the 1980's and i was always hooked. When I heard that there was going to be a big screen movie based on the cartoon I thought dreams had been granted.This movie ticked all the correct boxes. Great action sequences, effects, story, music and laughs as well. There were so many moments that stood out and the comedy also enhanced the film.I thought it was a surprise that Shia LeBouf had been cast as the lead character, all i could remember watching him in the children's programme Even Stevens. I did not expect him to pull off his role, he did not look like the stereotypical hero, he excelled and handle the delivery of his lines superbly, especially one liners. A brave and well casted. Well done Shia.Everyone will enjoy the film, it has everything for everyone and the pace is well suited. An awesome and well executed piece of work from Michael Bay.","Aug 1, 2007",10,/10
"I remember not thinking much of this movie when I first saw it after it came out. That was the only time I ever watched it until recently, and I was surprised to find I enjoyed it a lot more on the second viewing seventeen years later. I'm well versed in Michael Bay. I know what he is about so I am able to go into his movies with an open mind. That being said, I found the fights hard to follow because the giant machines just mashed together making it hard to understand what was going on. This is certainly an issue they corrected in the sequels. The dialogue between the robots was pretty cheesy, but putting it into context, they did a solid job of recreating the same flair that made the cartoon fun. Who expects a film based on a toy line to have amazing lines and characterizations anyway? I never noticed until this time around that it was the ""Lost,"" guys that wrote it, which made it a bit more interesting for me. I'll never like Shia Lebouf but he performed what was required of him adequately. Overall, I think I was able to enjoy it more as an older person, because I wasn't over analyzing it and just accepting it for what it was. A fun premise with great effects...just like all of Michael Bay's work.","Mar 28, 2024",6,/10

Every Transformer has an unique personality, all of them where great in the movie, when they Transform, it looks like a real thing. Spielberg and Bay did a great hell of a job in this movie, now we understand why he wanted to be 21st century, because the show from the 80s looked kind of old. The US military was great, the airplanes where top of the line, the soldiers did a great job, all of the action was very intense, it's Michael Bay no doubt about it!!","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10
"Transformers are really big robots but my TV has a small little screen. So I am sure I miss all the fun because the robots seem like wrecked garbage whereas they are nicely designed seen on a theater screen! In spite of this handicap, the movie is still great, not exceptional but great. It's true that the suburbia feeling is a great door to plunge into this robotic world. Another good point is the talented cast: for me, Labeouf and Fox are newcomers but they are promised to a brilliant future (see Indy IV).I remember to have seen trailers but they didn't appeal me. So, another time, you got the proof that trailers aren't trustworthy because a bad one can make you miss a good movie.I am not a die hard fan of transformers so I can't judge the storyline, but it's a pity that is too much militarized. They are not the friendly neighbor anymore! But in a way, like someone said, it changes from suits, boots and wings! The big final action sequence is very well directed so I keep a good memory finally!

"I don't think this really needs yet another review, but I feel duty-bound to do my bit to offset the totally undeserved 10-stars given by so many persons apparently with no taste, or else involved with the production.This is unquestionably the worst Michael Bay ""film"" I have ever seen. It makes some of Uwe Boll's stuff look Oscar-worthy. Perhaps it is the combination of Bay and Spielberg which resulted in something much worse than either could have managed alone. Mr. Spielberg, the king of schmaltz, has his stamp all over this one.I guess the bad taste came from Mr. Bay's side of the family. I found the ""Bros before Hoes"" line to be downright offensive. And robots peeing on people. What is this, Scary Movie 5 or something? Absent plot, lame dialog, vomit-inducing camera-work, rotten acting, this movie has it all, no need to seek out a Uwe Boll film.On the plus side, Megan Fox is pretty easy to look at. Too bad she can't act.Oh, and the CGI isn't too bad. Must be where all the money went.","Nov 13, 2007",1,/10
"First when i saw the teaser of this movie... i found out to be usual sci-fiction movie. Saw the movie in 2008. was feeling too bored so thought let try to watch transformers. The result thrilled, enjoyed watching it. The movie has a got a strong plot along with screenplay. The previous Michael Bay movie i saw as The Island. Liked it thou..but Transformers has a strong impact on me. The Charactisation of the movie is perfect.. all the characters play the roles brilliantly.Autobots.. the good robots shared a good presence on screen... my personal fav are bumble bee, optimus & ironhide.. & looks perfect when they transforms.. iron hide looks strong as his name makes you feel it. In short Autobots are the coolest robots ever hit the history of Hollywood cinema. Decepticons mmmm perfect for the role of evil mean robots... Megatron... the best with his henchmen Starscream.. loved this chase when Bonecrusher & Optimus prime fight on the highway. the second best the when one of the Decepticons transform in front of Sam..Megan fox looks too hot & sexy. She shared the important role screen presence in the movie. The movie has got some humour & its upto the limit in the movie. The movie is gonna blow you away....Its a highly recommended movie.... finally a good blockbuster of sci-fiction movie after terminator ! my rating 10/10","Dec 5, 2010",10,/10
"In my books, it's never a good thing when the special effects (or a teaser trailer not set to release for another half a year) are a movie's strongest point. Still, I found it hard not be in awe of how realistically the Transformers were realized by the CGI team. Aesthetics have to count for something, right? Outside of that, 'Transformers' mainly struggles to intrigue. The basic story is a race of alien robots search for a powerful relic that landed on Earth years ago, which culminates in Optimus Prime and the Autobots fighting the evil Decepticons to save mankind with the help of a teenage boy and a small assortment of other humans.What failed the most? The script was so atrocious that it's as if the screenwriters knew the only way to keep the audience's attention was with shtick rather than engaging dialog. A movie doesn't have to be funny to be fun, which an action/adventure flick should be. Yet most of the humor was inappropriate for the mood of the scene and lent little to nothing to story or character development or an all around fun time.And the director, well his name is Michael Bay. Enough said there.Unfortunately, Bay's best talent, action, was a mixed bag. At times it was great popcorn fare, complete with explosions of epic proportions, lots of guns, and of course the impressive Transformers themselves. At other times though, the pacing was odd, destroying any tension that had built up. I also found it hard to tell exactly who was who and what was what when the Autobots and Decepticons were fighting, a sentiment I've seen echoed by other users, which is not a good thing for a movie that so clearly defines good and evil.All in all, I would have liked to see a new script, a new director (come on Spielberg), and more development dedicated to Transformers not named Optimus Prime or Bumblebee (this movie is called 'Transformers' right?) and less to Sam and Mikaela's blasé relationship. Yes still, this is a huge summer blockbuster, so I suppose expectations can only be so high. It's just disappointing that Hollywood feels it must water down something that could have been so cool.6.3/10","Jul 10, 2007",,
"Whoever says this is ""not a kids movie"" is fooling them self.I really liked it. I enjoyed it emensely. But it is so clearly just a toy commercial with a HUGE budget.Shia steals the show as far as the actors go. I laughed my head off at some of his lines. He did a great job delivering some cheesy dialog and he has a natural talent that sells the story.Aside from him, it's the toys that steal the show! Those GIANT ROBOTS are AWESOME!!! This movie had more action than all of the other summer films this year combined! (The only exception may be Die Hard 4, which I haven't seen yet.)I was one of those kids who purchased the very first Transformer toys back when Optimus Prime was a gun, and one of the characters was a cassette player. So my affection for the Transformers franchise goes way back.Without making this very long, suffice to say that it is well worth your money as long as you can appreciate that it is a Michael (explosions) Bay movie, full of cheese dialog, a ridiculous story, and its main purpose is to sell toys.Heck, I bought four Transformers after watching this. (For my sons, of course.)BRING ON THE SEQUEL!","Jul 7, 2007",7,/10
"I only watched a little bit of the '80s cartoon as a kid, but that was enough to turn me into a die-hard fan of the Autobots and Decepticons. Though, I must admit, when I first saw the original trailer way back when, I groaned. Transformers the live-action movie? This is gonna bomb.Ha.Transformers is Michael Bay's most recent masterpiece, breaking box office records around the globe. And the best part of the movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It truly is a nerd's dream come true.If you're a fan of the show, then you know what's going down: the Decepticons (the evil alien robots) are looking for the All Spark cube, the source of life from their home planet Cybertron. Now, these robots are bad-ass and, when the US government starts getting suspicious, they aren't afraid to bring on the smack down.This brings us to Sam Witwicky, played by the now-famous Shia LaBeouf. He's just an ordinary loser-like kid who doesn't know how to talk to girls, LadiesMan217 is his screen name, and is just getting his first car: a yellow 1974 Camaro. Quickly, Sam realizes that there's more to his car than meets the eye.The special effects are the best I've seen so far in any movie (second only to Davey Jones in the Pirates series). When you first see an actual transformation, you will be on the edge of your seat, jaw dropped to the floor. The battles are intense, and the car chases are just fantastic knowing that the cars are really giant robots in disguise. The acting is top notch, especially Shia (who is quickly becoming a favorite of mine) and his counter actress, Megan Fox. The dialogue constantly flows whenever they are in a scene together, which, thankfully, is often.The only character that I felt was unnecessary and was Anthony Anderson's character, a large, nerdy computer hacker who assists in decoding the Decepticon's messages (long story). He was annoying and clearly placed into the movie for comic relief, which Shia took care of fine all by himself.The story is pretty out-there, and it will take some suspension of belief to take in everything, but the movie is staying as true to the original cartoon without being too silly. For that, I give the cast and crew complete respect.The movie does seem a bit long, especially if you're seeing it for the second time, but it truly is the most fun you'll have at the movies all summer. And, really, who can resist going to hear Peter Cullen back as Optimus Prime? Seriously?","Jul 11, 2007",9,/10

"I grew up watching the cartoon series ""Transformers"" in the 80s. The protagonist in the cartoon, ""Optimus Prime"" , was my childhood hero. He was the leader of the valiant Autobots (Autonomous Robotic Organisms) which opposed the tyranny of the evil Decepticons, led by Megatron, on the planet Cybertron. Optimus Prime was a noble king, much like King Arthur, who displayed affection and compassion for others. He was a born-leader who was willing to sacrifice himself for the service of freedom and liberty. I always remember his catchphrase- ""Freedom is the right of all sentient beings"". When I found out that my beloved cartoon series in the 80s would be adapted into a live action movie, I was thrilled beyond words. Finally, after all the waiting, Transformers was released in Hong Kong last week. I attended a screening on its opening night and the movie did not let me down. First and foremost, this movie is not going to win the Academy award for best picture because it is not supposed to win any. It is a pop-corn action flick and it delivers more than that. It is a glorious and dazzling entertainment for the summer! Unlike the cartoon series back in the 80s, this motion picture is a live action movie which is set in real life settings in the 21st century. All the robots in the movie are generated by computer imagery which seamlessly blend in with the live action elements. The CGI work in the movie is groundbreaking and sets the new benchmark for modern film making. Watching real cars, trucks and fighter jets transforming into robots is truly an eye opening experience. The robots look photo realistic and their transformations on the big screen are stunning beyond my expectations. It is a pure joy to watch them interacting with humans and battling their hearts out on the big screen. Suffice to say, this movie lays the foundation for the advancement of CGI work in the modern cinema. For those of you who are action movie buffs, this movie surely will not disappoint you. This movie plays at a fanatic pace which provides an adrenaline surge for more than 2 and a half hours. The action simply grabs you and does not let go. Unfortunately (albeit inevitably), the plot and the human characters have to play second fiddle to the robots and their non-stop action sequences. There is simply not enough screen time for all the characters. The screenplay is serviceable in the sense that it helps advance the story forward but it is certainly not of Oscar caliber. I also think the writer tried to put too many robot characters into the movie as a result of which there is not enough character development of the robots other than Optimus prime and Bumblebee. This movie is in essence about a boy and his first car (which turns into an alien robot). I have no doubt that the gifted Shia Laboeuf, who plays the boy ""Sam Witwicky"", will have a very bright future in cinema ahead of him. His spontaneous acting with his natural sense of humor carries the movie on his back. One critic said if it's true that there's an 8-year-old boy inside every man, ""Transformers"" is just the ticket to bring the kid out. How true. My 8 year old self had his adrenalin bumping when he saw his childhood hero Optimus Prime transforming from a truck into a gigantic robot for the first time on the big screen in more than 20 years.

"This is an entertaining action movie concerning the invasion of Earth by living robots that can mimic Earth technology, like cars and planes etc. Parents should be warned though-the movie is based on a cartoon show which was based on toys...which means small kiddies will want to collect the ENTIRE ""Transformers"" collection of toys, cartoons, etc. So, this movie is potentially dangerous to your wallet and mortgage.Firstly, seeing as the genesis of this movie is so rooted in children's' toys and cartoons, the movie is quite adult in parts-with matters concerning sex and masturbation...so, it's quite odd to see this kind of material in a movie which is presumably not suitable for its child consumer audience.Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie quite funny in parts, especially as I groaned at some of the early 'humour' of one of the ""Transformers"" (a car, in this case) playing certain songs on the radio which shadowed the car's driver's expectations (in getting laid).The movie features the Italian Dustin Hoffman, John Turturro, as well as John Voight, who both bring the occasional B movie melodrama acting in a self-conscious way...to good effect.The movie is pretty much non-stop action, but yet not in a bad way, as some action scenes/movies can be (like the mass fighting scenes in one of the Planet Of The Apes movies as well as Attack Of The Clones, the second Star Wars prequel). The special effects are excellent in this movie...from the transformation of cars etc. into humanoid looking fighting robots, as well as the scenes of destruction brought about by the Transformers in urban environments.I doubt that this movie is something that can be enjoyed so much on a second viewing, but you cannot fault its entertainment value on first viewing.Its saving grace for older audiences is (apart from the action scenes), is, as I say, the humour. From teenagers, to parents (especially the Transformers themselves), each brings some comedy to the proceedings.However, some of the 'philosophy' in the movie is painful to listen to-the ""Transformers"" spout some non-sense, which is presumably to guide how children play with their toys or something. It's a very ODD combination of adult material and material for children. The movie can't seem to make up its mind on what its target audience is.","Mar 20, 2008",6,/10
"IF ONLY................................................................. They had made a more coherent (or less scattered) story, not wasted so much time searching for the pair of you know whats and made the script more realistic and natural ( you'll know when you see it) this would have been up there with Terminator 2 in terms of great sci fi robot pics. I can easily see past the changes they made to the transformers of old- ie personality and what the turn into, if all of the above were corrected. I state this because most if not all of the action sequences were astounding. The sound effects, look and movement of the robots in action was almost flawless and this was the film's saving grace- along with the great voices for prime and megatron. Just when I was REALLY loving this, it cut to something else and spent too long on scenes that wern't needed at all. If there's one negative thing about the fight sequences it's that they occurred too often towards the end, spoiling us then building to a finally that ended too suddenly, making the film end with a whimper instead of a bang (the whole film is a bang i suppose, so it's just comparatively speaking). What a great looking movie, could have had more soul though, but I'll definitely see it at least one more time at the cinema!! 7.5 out of 10","Jun 23, 2007",5,/10
"I grew watching Transformers and playing it with my friends as a little kid in the school playground (I was always a Decepticon). When I saw the trailer for the very first time I was blown away at the special affects and saw my child hood cartoon characters bought to life - something in me said that this movie was going to rock but I have had my doubts since Spider-man 3 that was billed to be the biggest blockbuster of summer turned out to be an over-hyped let down. I am glad to tell you that Transformers was something that lived up to the hype!!! Right from the opening scene one is blown away from the awesomeness and power of these cybernetic organisms and once again you felt like a little child amazed by what unfolded in front you. CGI was definitely what made this movie and without it, its hard to imagine otherwise but it is absolutely amazing as you watching a massive robot turn its self into a fighter jet and back again. It was good to see all my old goodies like Optimus Prime with the correct voice from the cartoon series and an ultra cool paint job and the rest of the gang hanging about and certainly not to mention the bad guys who really meant business. The movie retained a comical tone all the way through with gags and wise cracks from everyone which was funny. The acting was great as all the actors really put it well with the interaction with the robots . My only complaint was that I felt everyone was a little too clued up on what to do and how to tackle the impending problems and he ending left a bit like eh? was that it ? But however I did remember things kicking off and shutting down very quickly on the cartoon series as well which is another reason for old time sake I let the cheesy one liners go. I would of also like to have seen some character development on other Autobots and Decpitcons because any Transformers fan will tell you that they each have their own personality thats why you gotta love them all !Too conclude Transformers was a piece of childhood that I thought I would never see on the big screen but thanks to the modern wonders of CGI done correctly it was kind of like a dream come true , I would ask fans to go with other fans and those of have young kids of their own take them and share a piece of your childhood with them. Thank you Mr.Bay!TRANSFORMERS - 8.9 OUT 10 SOME SHALL COME TO DESTROY US! SOME SHALL COME TO DEFEND US!","Jul 30, 2007",8,/10
"I was a big fan of Transformers as a kid and I can't begin to explain how excited I was when I heard that they were going to make it into a full on live action movie.Transformers tells the story of the Autobots (the good robots) and the Deceptacons (the bad robots). The deceptacons are out to get a device known as the Allspark, a device that has the power to destroy human life on earth. The Autobots are there to make sure that doesn't happen. The leader of the Autobots Optimus Prime forms an alliance with Sam Witwicky, a teenager who has the key to finding the Allspark...blah blah blah.First of all, the praises: the special FX in this movie are seamless. You could almost believe that they created these robots from scratch just for this film. The film is also quite respectful to the original cartoon. Optimus is still a truck and is voiced by the one and only Peter Cullen, Starscream is still a jet, but some have been changed, and the changes are very welcome. The humour has also been given special treatment, with a fair share of laugh-out-loud moments.Now the complaints: although this is an action film and people don't normally care about the story for a film such as this, that still doesn't make it right that it was pretty much ignored. There are some blatant plot holes in this film and the script could have been further fine tuned and tested before they decided to say ""oh what the hell, let's just get on with the action!"". Also, Michael Bay's directing is...difficult to follow. Yes, the action comes in thick and fast, and there is no shortage of explosions and metal crunching, but, my God, can't you just pull the camera back a bit and let us see what's going on? The editing is too fast and often you are left gritting your teeth because he simply won't show you what's happening in the whole picture! So, they have green-lit two sequels. This film was a very decent stab at it. It was a good way of seeing the Transformers in life action mode and there are moments when you want to jump out of your seat in amazement. I just hope that in the new ones they fine tune the script a little and please let us see what's going on more!","Aug 3, 2007",7,/10
"Michael Bay + Transformers = failure + pissing robots.... wtf? PRO = ILM SFX CON = Michael Bay (and the chaos that ensues)A family rambles on about masturbation, and one of the transformers pisses on a human....Every person on this site I'm sure would know better then to have scenes like this in the new transformers movie. Michael Bay in his infinite wisdom of appealing to the ""target demographic"" knows no better. The movie was a disgrace, and I do not blame the producers for hiring (or subsequently not firing) the director since I'm sure he was a integral part of financing. I blame Michael Bay since his ""style"" is all over this film. This is not a Transformers movie, this is a stupid action film with robots that transform. Bay completely disregarded the fans of this property (i.e. comments in Wired magazine stating since he's the director, he's going to do whatever he damn well pleases and put flames on the truck cause visually it looks cool) News flash Michael Bay, you're blinded by whatever you think ""looks cool"" and not about story, heart, the characters or the 99 other things that make a movie good. I confess I didn't follow the story, and I didn't care to. The film starts out well enough, but the bland characters began to beat reality into my head that this was a very poor film. About 30 minutes into the film, where the transformers are standing around in the garden killing the plants etc, I gave up on this film. (shortly before the American pie 4 rejected scene about masturbation) The story makes no sense, and I don't want to point out the plot holes. By the time the action started at the end of the film, I simply didn't care. That's a hard thing to for a director to do, since for the last 20 years of my life I wanted to see robots transform and fight. Yet bay managed to undo 20 years of building excitement in a few hours. I don't even know where to begin with Prime's lips or the robots designs. They are so completely asinine that words fail me. I only think of Bay thinking, ""well, we'll make them have lots of moving parts, really complex cause that's cool"". Another example of his flawed judgment as a filmmaker. They should have stayed true to the original designs of the Transformers. While most will just say, ""well I love the action, so this movie kicks ass"". Well you're letting this movie off the hook. I don't agree with the style in which Michael Bay has his action sequences shot. Overly hyper kinetic and so frantic I cannot tell what's going on. The second this film starts, you know it's a Michael Bay by the filters they use and the generic butt rock. I guess that's why Bay is hired, cause he will give you exactly the same thing over and over again. While that's fine, and I know to avoid his films.... I have a problem when he disrespects everything that is special about Transformers.This movie is a mindless action film. I guess that's all that Bay aspires to, since there is no characters to fall in love with. No hero to route for, no hero is despise. There is nothing here but a hollow, shell of a movie. You might as well just have ILM cut a version of this movie with just all the effects and sell that version. You tell me one person in the audience who gave a rats ass about any of the characters.... and who were not just waiting for the robots to show up? And mind you, Bay removed any kind of connection to the Autobots etc. that I had. I wanted to like this movie with every fiber of my being. I would have been the easiest to please with just a few things to latch onto. There was nothing there. If I made the movie, I would embrace what is loved about transformers. Focus on the transformers (not about a horny teenager). I would have set the film in the 1980's and embraced that whole era of time. At least they had some of the original voice cast for this film, but it's too little, too late. My brain is breaking down now since I'm extremely upset that they ruined this film. Obviously the nostalgia was there since the film opened so well at the box office. Hopefully when they ""re-imagine"" this film, since they would be foolish to make a direct sequel, they will respect what we love about the transformers, and not dumb it down to nothing more then a action film with robots. I wish they didn't call this transformers, since now the name transformers is a little tarnished. shame on you Michael Bay. shame on you.","Jul 8, 2007",1,/10
"Some things I learned about software while watching Die Hard 4.0 and Transformers: 1. A hacker is most of the times a hot chick. 2. A hacker never uses normal operating systems. They have a bizarre OS, that is specifically optimized for their single need - displaying a map of USA with red dots on it. 3. When a computer is hacked into, the screen flickers. 4. Evil hackers, even if hot chicks, will always be proficient at martial arts as well. 5. You can hack a computer system by directing weird sounds at it. 6. Visualization is king - code breaking and pattern recognition are achieved using quick manipulations of 3D images. Review also appeared on www.pashabitz.com","Jul 26, 2007",8,/10

"From the opening sequence this movie never let up. I never followed the cartoon series, but what surprised me the most about this movie was the realistic intensity of the military sequences.I would have been tempted to give this movie 10 stars in the same category as Bourne Identity, a personal favorite. However, at times the movie took on an Independence Day cheeziness as the heroes consisted of a bunch of misfits clashing with the stereotypically inept g-men which amounts to little more than political statements that I find particularly bland and stupid. However, it is partially redeemed by the efforts of the special ops forces in the end. But rather than watch Shia Lebouef be transformed from his experience, he simply ends up with the girl in the end.Also, what's the deal with the glasses? They are imprinted with the navigation coordinates of the Cube's whereabouts circa late 19th century which happens to be the not yet built Hoover dam? Go figure.","Mar 30, 2008",7,/10
"Transformers is a very fun movie to watch. I had such a blast watching this. It won't win any awards unless it's special effects based because of the type of movie it is. This is just a summer film to sit back, relax, and have a great time for two and a half hours.This is about a how machine-like aliens and humans bond together to save the Earth from destruction.Shia impressed me. I haven't been impressed with Shia before this movie. But this movie made me realize that Shia has the tools to be a great actor. Also Megan Fox is the number one hottie.This is what you call a typical Michael Bay movie. It's full of action, CGI, and a fun time.Overall, this is a great movie. I rate this film 9/10.","Feb 9, 2011",9,/10
"Is anything in this movie ""more than meets the eye""? Certainly not. If there's one thing Bay is good at it is delivering the goods up, front-and-center, with no subtleties but also no restraints. Is this necessarily a good thing? Not when he's trying to direct something that is supposed to have any sense of seriousness, such as Pearl Harbour. But on a movie like this, anything goes: I mean, it's about giant alien robots from outer space who have come to do battle on Earth. That pretty much opens almost endless array of doors to Bay's disposal, and of course doesn't leave much room for subtleties. This film's characters are flat but believable; the plot is implausible but not ridiculous. Somehow it all comes together and works in the long run.I give credit to Spielberg, though, for setting the overall tone of the film and ultimately restraining Bay. Quite unlike his previous ""epics"" such as Armageddon and The Island, Transformers unfolds with an always-vigorous sense of light-hearted fun and adventure. The film has many cheesy moments, but never does it get preachy nor kitschy, and for Bay to have avoided such obvious opportunities to sneak in that kind of nonsense, I salute the picture and the producers involved that prevented a moment such as Bruce Willis' sacrifice at the climax of Armageddon. This never-serious tone comes across also in the sly and razor-sharp sense of humour, which I thought was absolutely hilarious and worked wonderfully.The acting, quite surprisingly, also worked. Sure, actors like John Turturro and Jon Voight pretty much play caricatures, but the true shocker is Shia LaBeouf, the young up-and-rising star who was too annoying in I Robot and Constantine but who delivers a sharp, witty and very human and believable performance as the young protagonist. His turn in this film quite reassures me of his potential in the upcoming fourth Indiana Jones movie. I expect good things.But this movie has one main central purpose, and I salute it for never once trying to hide it: to entertain and deliver mind-blowing visuals. And it more than exceeds in both of these fields. From the earliest, relentlessly thrilling car chases and all through the final showdown in downtown L.A., this film is a wild, wild ride that grabs you by the collar and never lets you go once. Its speed and pace is impeccable and relentless, and it always keeps you engaged with even more bombastic, even grander, even more insane set pieces and action sequences as it progresses. Bay has of course by now perfected the art of the high-octane action sequence, and with such a broad palette of flashy cars, giant robots, unlimited advanced weapons and the broad, sprawling wide spaces of the American West, Bay, quite unlike some of his counterparts and, dare I say, imitators, knows exactly when to film with intense chaos and when to treat us with a wide, slow-motion long-shot to let us take it all in. In terms of the cinematography and visual style, every shot is flawlessly constructed and gorgeously stylized in terms of lighting, composition, angles and movement. The computer graphic work by ILM is utterly stupefying and probably more convincing than most any other CGI work I've seen lately, as is the excellent sound design by Eric Aadahl, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film nabs an Oscar or two in these categories. And with imagery like a fighter jet flying at full speed only to transform into Starscream in mid-air, grab onto the bottom of a bridge and flip around, landing on his feet on top of it, or a slow-motion shot of Optimus Prime and Megatron literally flying through a high-rise office building, one cant help but sit back and grin.While watching this film, one also can't help but sit back and wonder: what would it be like had Steven Spielberg done more than produce, and perhaps filled in the director's chair as well. What's for sure is that his mark is more than felt on the movie with Bay at the helm: the whole bond between Sam and Bumblebee is strongly present, and scenes such as the one where Sam goes to his house to fetch the glasses while the Autobots wait impatiently in his backyard are pure Spielberg. Would the film necessarily be better? Perhaps, although perhaps Bay was the perfect man for this project with his loud, over-produced and over-the-top approach. But what's for sure is that it would have been very different. I can imagine the family aspect, especially Sam's relationship with his father, far more emphasized, as well as his friendship with Bumblebee, who as the silent visitor from outer space who forms a bond with the protagonist, is an extremely Spielberg-esquire character as it is. Perhaps the military aspect would have also been far less emphasized. It is definitely an interesting thought, but maybe considering the already-ridiculous nature of the plot to begin with, Bay's easy-on-the-brain-feast-for-the-eyes approach is exactly what it needed.It's loud, it's over-done, it's exaggerated and populated with caricatures and flat characters. It lacks any value in plot and characters. But it is irresistibly entertaining and undeniably well-made, far more so than the other big event films prior to it this summer. And its overall light, all-in-the-fun tone really allows one to just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a thrilling, relentless and fantastic ride it is. Ultimately, Spielberg's production along with Bay's visuals match perfectly to create the ultimate brainless summer entertainment.","Jul 19, 2007",7,/10

The music also suites the movie well enough. It's time for Autobots to rule. Autobots, you rock !!!Watch this movie in 3D-iMax theater. You won't regret. I was satisfied for the money I spent for this movie. I had to get this DVD soon.I give this movie a 8.9 for 10Heard there's sequel on it's way. Can't wait to get my hands on it.

"Transformers (2007) Review: In a world of remakes and rewrites, we get a childhood classic Transformers. The thing is that I was looking forward to this movie. Here is my take: Transformers starts off okay with a pretty terrifying scene at a military base with a first look at one of the Decepticons in the form of a helicopter. Seems like a serious movie is in play, right? Then things go from good to bad when we are introduced to our main character. Sam Witwickey(Shia LeBeouf)is a total dork who is in need of some......companionship. He gets himself his first car that is a really worn out Camero. Of course it is our first Autobot in disguise.What is wrong here is quite simple. First, Our lead character is so overblown as a desperate dork that it becomes frustrating. I GET IT. He is stuck with parents that are so out of touch like they just can't live past the 50's. It's the cliché loser title character. He picks up a hot chick(Megan Fox)and all things get awkward. The car starts playing cheesy music and starts all sorts of problems for no reason at all. This set off a series of irritating scenarios. Transformers suddenly became a 3rd rate teen comedy. Honestly, anything involving Shia's character was off the charts dreadful.We get some more serious stuff from the pentagon finding out info about the alien lifeforms then we meet another set of irritating characters. Another hot chick who just happens to be an amazing wizard on the computer than anyone else in the freaking pentagon. Unreal. Did I mention that she is about 20 years old? Anyway we meet the annoying Anthony Anderson as well.Then we finally meet the rest of the Transformers. One good thing here is that Peter Cullen still has got it. He is perfect as Optimis Prime. Too bad that even the Transformers(or at least the Autobots anyway)are a bunch of idiots too, the scene at Sam's house for example was horrendous.After all of this, we finally get to the point and the conclusion of the movie and it's quite anti-climatic. And the closing shot of the movie could not be in anymore bad taste.So to sum thing up: The Pros: The special FX are dazzling. The transforming was cool as well as the voice-overs.Cons: About 90% of this movie. From having plot holes to shaky action scenes and having horrendous teenage comedy stuck in the middle(about an hour of this movie was filled with this garbage)to guys being the idiots and worthless character development to our ""hero"" and almost none to the Transfomers.Get it? The Last Word: Ick. This is EASILY one of the worst movies of the year. It's comedy sucked, it's action did not deliver, it's acting was wooden, the characters were annoying.....woo..gah.....let me catch my breath. I REALLY wanted to like this. Do not see this. It's not just my final word, I am doing a public service by not recommending this trash. I cannot remember having such a terrible time in the theaters.","Jul 4, 2007",1,/10

"I never really watched the cartoon, just an episode here and there, but I still enjoyed the movie. It had a good amount of laughs sprinkled throughout the film, and the animation was fantastic. However, in a few spots the movie seemed to stop in order to give a detailed description of what had happened in the past. These long speeches drew me away from the movie. This information could have been better intertwined into the film. However, in this film everything seems to stop in order to let dialog take place. Overall, I thought the film did a good job entertaining all age groups of Transformer fans and the common movie buff alike.","Jul 14, 2007",7,/10

"I saw it twice in the first week; awesome movie! The detail put towards the design and the meta-morphing from car to ""mech-warrior"" and back to car is great! Its so good that it is like an action pack in itself. It makes me wonder if any life size Transformers were built to help with the CG movements. I've seen how sensors can be placed on the body to record the movements of a human's muscle and bone structure. The movie is as good and even better than the previews made it out to be with a good story line and good acting. The beginning was great with the desert combat scene. The fact that the producers had so much cooperation with the Airforce and military branches made this movie so much better.","Jul 11, 2007",10,/10
"All I have to say is that this was a wonderful movie.... completely blew me away. I'd recommend it to anyone who want to go to the movies and just have plain old fashion fun. Can't wait until they make more installments.The CGI was very out of this world. I think most of the people in the audience thought it was great as well.What I didn't like about the movie was that they should have explained a bit more about some of the characters. It really did seem a bit rushed. Although, what they did explain should be easy enough for anyone to follow.Again, BRAVO.....","Jul 4, 2007",,

And the best is that I wasn't expecting something like that at all... funny , full of action and with great performances from the actors.The special effects are the best I've ever seen . The academy award in this category is a fact I think , I am still surprised how the robots become normal to see in the streets at some point of the movie I mean , you really feel is real!!The cast is great. It is unbelievable how Shia LaBeouf has become a star that fast . Both Disturbia and Transformers are 2 cool movies of this year and his performance in both are very funny and enjoyable .And he goes for more in Indiana Jones next adventure (Steven Spielberg seems to like Shia , no wonder he has given to Shia main characters in great roles)Megan Fox , John Voight and John Turturro are awesome too in their roles.Amazing movie , you must see it , it is worth your money.","Jul 24, 2007",10,/10

"The image of very large robots hiding out of sight around a suburban house is a wonderfully childish scene. The image of a jet fighter plane transforming and turning against the squadron it hid with is quite something.Structurewise, there is little here that is different from any summer blockbuster - slightly superior teen flick standard. But just as LotR declared year zero for visual effects, Transformers give us a perfect blend of live action and CGI. The transformations are stunning, and I never grew tired of watching them.The film is not too dominated by its many set pieces; nor is it ruined by squeezing humour into the bits where proper dialogue should appear. In summary this is somewhat short of real film making, but it achieves its aim of entertaining for its entire length.","Jul 26, 2007",7,/10
"One of the worst written, vulgar, rude and distasteful movies to come along in a long time. I squirmed in my chair all the way through this waste of good actors...and I only stayed because I hate wasting money. How these respected actors agreed to deliver dialogue a puppy could have written better is beyond me.....I hope they enjoy the money they made. Why does there have to be ugly finger gestures, racist humor, stereotypes, gratuitous sex references and other throw away inclusions in a movie just because the studios think they are pandering to the pulse of society? Well, there doesn't and if Michael Bay and all those other degenerative film makers think that they do, they are as much the purveyors of evil, just as much as a drug dealer is. There were so many problems with this movie, I don't have enough time to list them...I can concur though with others I've been reading....like how Shia's parents were useless, spouting masterbation references, plot holes including the fact that why Shia would carry the cube himself to the top of the building while avoiding the Decepticons when one of the Autobots or Prime could have easily done the same thing was stupid....like him running around the street or how about the building when somehow he outruns a Decepticon up about 30 flights of stairs to the roof. Arrrrrgh...too many things as I said, I can't list all the problems here. The fact that people see this movie doesn't mean it's good for them. This is what is contributing to the decline of western civilization...and their denial (what a great, convenient, pull from your pocket defense) doesn't make it any less true. If the film industry is to have a responsibility to society and to kids, whom this movie leans towards, then go beyond the wallet and think....geeze, isn't a billion dollars enough for you? I compare this movie to The Cat in the Hat, another vulgar cinematic waste....basically because both that and this film are slaps in the face to the authors of the originals....the cartoon as well.

"I wasn't really expecting to see anything very good when I started watching this movie on TV. After all, it was based on a line of action figures, so I didn't think I would enjoy it enough to continue watching. But I was very surprised by how quickly it drew me in, and kept me in the action at all times, with never a dull moment.Although the plot seems a bit out of wack to me, everything else is very well-done. The acting is great, especially by Shia LaBeouf (also rest in peace Bernie Mac, who had about two minutes of footage). The special effects and battle scenes are really well done, and there are a lot of captivating subplots that all eventually tie in to the main plot seamlessly. The movie's suspenseful at times, action-packed at others, and downright hilarious also.So overall, this is a good movie, bordering on great. I just think the plot needed a bit of touching up. So if you get the chance, go ahead and watch it, you won't be disappointed.","Aug 10, 2008",6,/10
"The worst thing about this movie are the people who are loving it and are serious about it too. It just makes me feel worried that THAT many people can be so wrong and have THAT bad of taste in movies.At best this movie is a bad ripoff Armageddon, I could feel the story and soul of Armageddon in this movie coming to real while the plot unfolded but not close as good. Most the movie just didn't make sense, I never got any interest for a character in the movie and how could I ? Even if you are a Tranformer freak I cant understand how you could love this film.Sadly I have lost all trust in Michael bay of delivering something real and good anymore, Surly he CAN deliver to the BOXOFFFICE nodoupt. But he sold his soul in return.So what is a good comic series on film? Superman ? No. Batman? Right On! There is a example to follow. what C. Nolan did with Batman Bay could never do.Michael Bay needs to go back to the roots and take more care of the story and keep the balance between blowing up cars and the storyline, like in The Rock. Maybe he needs someone like J. Bruckheimer to hold him back sometimes.In my opinion Transformers lacked human interference. I need to see real people I believe in and see them dealing with the problems that occur. I could never care more about a Robot than a Human.I have seen the movie 3 Times now, twice in the theater and once on HD DVD and its painful to see some of my friends cheering it, and at the same time bashing great movies like The Prestige and Apocalypto.

"Watching this, I delightfully realise... ""thankfully, no real writer has to take responsibility for writing this pool of toxic waste."" The story is so obviously written by a toy-making company. During lunch. On a napkin. Using a finger dipped in jam. For example, with names like ""Decepticons"", ""Megatron"" and ""Optimus Prime""... there's no way to escape from toy-land confinement.With much difficulty, I tried to set aside the cheap toy-story, and tried to follow the film instead, however little there was in there. The reward I got from this was nausea and utter dejection. This ""movie"" is made by and for people that played with transformer toys when they were kids (maybe they still do?). The juvenile portrayal of the two protagonists is just silly. It belongs in a direct-to-video movie. Many times I just thought to myself: ""oh no, they didn't just do that, did they?"".Now, you're probably saying ""but it's just a cheap summer blockbuster flick""... and you'd be right. It's exactly that and it deserves no higher grade than 4. Not because it's ""only an action movie"", but because it's very very bad. Even ""only""-action movies need a sane, cohesive plot and somewhat understandable characters. Otherwise what's the point? For me there's none, but judging by the grade it got here, I guess there's many that doesn't need more.I'll give it the benefit of a doubt for the CG. As an inquisitive ""pixel-police"", I admit there'are some nice interaction between the live elements and the CG elements in this movie. People see the climate changes as a threat... I see another threat, perhaps a more short-term one; crappy CG-focused movies. I urge all movie-goers; don't pay for crap! Is this really the trend we want to encourage?! Like MPAA and RIAA says: ""piracy is theft""; I say: so is making crap and selling it as good quality entertainment.Of course, if all you're looking for is some nice CG, watch a car commercial. And you don't even have to pay; they show them for free on TV! But then again, a car commercial has a much more complex plot than this movie... It just sounds too good to be true.","Dec 23, 2007",,

I got just what I expected, all the Hollywood boxes were ticked, and for a couple of bucks it was worth the entertainment.The only thing that really irked me was Bumblebee was not Bumblebee and Megatron was completely reinvented - but meh, don't really care.

"Yeah, I've commented on movies on IMDb a lot, and I usually give them a ten, and this one is no exception. This is another gem that I wasn't all that certain would be good until the first scene, and then WHAM you are hooked! The movie is roughly about the Transformers, technically called Autobots, who are trying to save Earth from the Decepticons, which obviously are the evil version of these machines. From the name Autobot, you can tell that these Transformers do transform into cars, among them the beat up old Camero bought by sixteen year old Sam Witwicky. Anyway, Sam has this peculiar object that the Autobots require in order to save the planet from certain destruction so the geeky teen is recruited to help save humankind from the Decepticons.As mentioned earlier, I absolutely loved this movie. It has the perfect combination of humour, romance, and awesome action, the effects were very well done (was impressed that a movie as far fetched and ridiculous as a bunch of transforming cars actually seemed almost believable) and was at the edge of my seat the entire time (when I wasn't laughing or even almost crying, but I won't go into any other details, I don't want to spoil it for anyone else). Shia LaBeouf is a very talented young man, very fresh and sweet. An easy ten even if you are not into transforming robots.","Aug 22, 2007",10,/10

"Transformers benefits from a great cast, lovable machines, and a story, although preposterous, that is very entertaining. This truly is a blockbuster that you are into it, you can easily be on the edge of your seat. Never in my life would I have thought I would love watching robots beat the crap out of each other. This is definitely one of the best efforts in bringing an old television cartoon to the big screen, and it does so in great style. Shia LaBeouf leads this movie to stardom, with an exceptional performance, even though his character is a tad annoying at times. Sure there is dumb humor and almost too much action, but that is Michael Bay for you. All in all, it's one of Bay's best!","Jun 19, 2017",6,/10
"I watched the HBO 30 minute docu-trailer the night before and decided to go see this film. Well, all the good stuff was in the trailer. The rest is pretty embarrassing. The story just sat there for minutes at time and did nothing, and then would get up and do something totally stupid. Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of product shots. This is a 2.5 hour commercial for junk food and junk cars. Chase scenes that came out of nowhere and went back to where they came from. Completely unbelievable characters overacting their way through unbelievable situations. What did I expect from Bay... not EBay!!!! I left my seat early to go buy printer paper. Wished I had seen the cartoon rat movie instead of this piece of crap about walking trash cans.","Jul 13, 2007",1,/10
"The film not only dazzles with its action and visual effects but also manages to create engaging human characters. Shia LaBeouf's portrayal of Sam Witwicky injects the story with humor and relatability, making him a likable and endearing protagonist. Megan Fox shines as his resourceful and fearless love interest, Mikaela Banes, adding depth and charm to the film. The talented supporting cast, featuring the likes of John Turturro and Jon Voight, brings additional entertainment value, with their performances adding layers to the overall narrative. Their presence and interactions with the Transformers provide a human connection amidst the sci-fi chaos, ensuring that the film resonates on both emotional and action-packed levels.","Jul 3, 2023",10,/10
"Two large Cybertronian race groups, the Decepticons and the Autobots involved came to earth in search of the desired resource. A young man gets involved in it by being on the side of the Autobots and the Decepticons come to attack them.Transformers is a film directed by Michael Bay that tells the story of the arrival of alien robots who come to earth to find ancient resources lost from their planet. I think this will be the opening film of the Transformers franchise going forward. A great movie premise with stunning visual effects. Neat and detailed details in packaging each form of robot. The appearance of both the Decepticons and the Autobots is made in as much detail as possible. Likewise with the visuals when the action of the fight between them presents interesting visuals ranging from shots to detailed punches. Not to forget the big explosions that became the hallmark of Michael Bay.Those good visual effects are not in line with the plot of this movie. The film has a pretty good story plot. There is not much drama and it is enough to give a good performance of the action scenes. This film is like a pilot film for a film franchise. A conflict that is not much well constructed. The pace of the film is fairly fast and full of scenes that lead to the point. Quite deeply explore and introduce the world of Cybertron in this film. Simple but enough to open the story and become the beginning for the Transformers franchise. In addition, I was very dissatisfied with the acting performed by Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox. Megan Fox's presence only sweetened and gave rise to unnecessary sexism.","Jan 7, 2023",7,/10

"Transformers (2007) is purely an action film. All aspects of the movie are inferior to the on-screen spectacle of massive fighting robots, car chases and explosions. Luckily, most people were expecting just that, as was I.The intensity of the film is indeed one of its strong points. Another is the incredible CGI. The computer generated Transformers blend in seamlessly with the surrounding cityscapes and create a visually appealing action movie. The camera-work and editing is a bit too fast at times, making some fight scenes hard to follow, but creating a certain dynamic as well. Also the plot is as thin as a single sheet of paper.But that is not what bothered me about Transformers. The problem is that this movie was catered too much to a single target audience: young males in the ages 12 to 18. The teenage lead characters enforce this by stumbling around in romantic scenes and blurting out jokes that range from horribly unfunny to half decent at best. The acting is not one of the films strong points either. This combined makes the ""human"" scenes far inferior to the action / robot scenes. Luckily there's more than enough action to be seen, which is the reason why I did enjoy watching this film.I somewhat recommend this film to anyone who can take this movie for what it is: A shallow sci-fi action flick that makes up for its meager acting, writing and humor by giving us a real visual spectacle. Nothing more, nothing less.","Oct 19, 2007",7,/10
"This is a visual feast of a movie!! The special effects are just absolutely amazingly real!! The plot is very much something that would be in a generation 1 episode. I was absolutely enthralled when I found out that Peter Cullen was coming back as the voice of Optimus. He was, is, and always will be Optimus, no matter what!! Megatron was very cool, and I find it interesting that they kept Optimus's axe and Megatron's flail from the very first episode. The action is extremely well put together, the humor is great, and the acting is superb!! This in my opinion, the best way you could spent 2 hours. Transformers was always one of my favorite shows and they put it on the big screen extremely well. I only have 2 complaints about the movie. The first is Starscream's voice. In the show, it was a high pitch annoying voice, but in the movie, they made it deeper and more evil. The second is Bumblebee's voice. In the cartoon he was the kid of the Autobots, yet in the movie, when he does talk, he sounds more like a professor or something like that. I can't wait for the sequel!!!!","Mar 7, 2008",9,/10
"It is 2007 (some time ago we had futuristic movies flash forwarding to these years:)) and we need a new breed of action movies. Its time for what we called action flicks to upgrade to smarter and beta versions - dynamic action flicks - possessing all former characteristics but moving up in the cinematic arts scale. Michael Bay, deliberately or not, made an attempt at it with Armageddon. Mr. Spielberg, consciously understanding these ""thin"" moments in cinema, has got the feel for it. Furthermore, they all know that as with software production a final version, that everybody loves and most importantly knows how to use, takes a lot of time and beta versions. From the preview to the actual film - Welcome to dynamic action flicks version 0.1 ""Transformers 2007"". It is not a big surprise most other actions coming out until recently  even though good production and so forth look like a versions 0.0. As in fashion you got to have the feeling, the feeling the ones who now it categorize it as close to psychic - the rest call it a feeling for the trend, the fashion, you've heard it.Well it takes time but they are coming so we shall all have a nice time with future action movies , as copy cats don't waste time and will make us a good favor at least while the trend lasts then boredom again until someone gets the feeling If interested in seeing how the above mentioned trend is starting to grow on the industry don't miss""Die Hard 4""""I am a Legend""Probably ""Hitman"" as well even though I have not seen it.Also heard there is a Van Dam action coming out that due to all this will be more decent than usual.6+1 = 7/10 (6 for the film itself, 1 for the feeling ;))","Jan 9, 2008",7,/10

The Autobots and the Decepticons bring their war from the planet of Cybertron to Earth. They battle for the Allspark which is a mystical source of unimaginable power. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has artifacts from his grandfather who met a giant robot in his arctic expedition.This is a much better movie than I could ever expect. I had serious reservations when I first heard that Michael Bay was going to make a live action Transformers movie. The CGI looks great. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox actually work. They have spark and charisma. The action is massive and impressive.It's the story where the movie has a few problems. It's convolute and too complicated. But nobody watches this for the story.

"Fellow Americans, wake-up ! You must be either a nerd or a big kid to like this kind of movie. Plot less story, just-OK CGI and one of the most stupid SciFi movie ever-made, period.I mean, how can the robots be 50 times larger than the cars ? Avanced, OK, but how about law of physics ? That's not SciFi. Blade Runner, Total Recall, OK, that's good scifi. Not this.And now, we have confirmation Hollywood and critics are totally gone 100% marketing. I mean, come on ... a B- rate by critics ? Why not an A while you're there...This movie represent all what i dislike in US recent productions and what makes us look so stupid to the rest of the world.At least, Armagedon had so believable story. And ""the island"" was a pretty good movie. But this ... is just crap.

"so before i saw it i heard how amazing it was for all these different people. it was a good amount of people too (including the never wrong IMDb) and nobody said it was bad, nobody said it was OK, nobody even said it was pretty good. all i heard was that it was OMG AWESOME! i had been wanting to see it since i came out so i waited over a week to see it and these comments only fueled that fire....so i went into the movie theater two days ago with very high expectations. i was thinking that it was going to put the matrix and lord of the rings to shame, that it was even going to pass 300. being the idiot that i determined the movie before i even saw it. i had this fantasy in my head that no movie could live up to. and because of that, through no fault of the movie, i was disappointed by the action. and I'm not saying that the action wasn't enough, I'm not saying that this movie didn't give me goosebumps a few times, I'm just say that its not that jaw-dropping action extravaganza that i built it up to be in my head....on the flip side of my disappointment in the action, i was pleasantly surprised by the comedy in this movie. i had no idea that this movie was going to be so damn funny. everyone is talking about how all these other movies have been this year but i think i laughed more at transformers than i did at any other movie this year. i know I'm probably going to have people disagree with me here, but i think this movie if funnier than knocked up or even almighty or any other comedy I'm forgetting....the story was very implausible, but who wasn't expecting that with transformers? the acting and visuals helps u forgive that anyways. this is the kind of movie where u don't ask questions, u just enjoy the amazing things your seeing and hearing....Shia LaBouf comes out of nowhere and comedic genius with his delivery and timing...the robots look as real as they can get...and the actions sequences (although less abundant than i would've like and filmed in a way that made me feel as if i couldn't see anything) were the kind that made u lean forward and shout ""WOOOooo"" or ""DAMN!""....my only problem with this movie was that the Transformers really took a backseat to the humans involved. the only robots that really got significant screen time were Prime and Bumblebee. there seemed to be one too many story lines; Sam's was the only one that really seemed necessary. i would've liked to see more robots instead of Anthony Anderson and that blonde girl he was running around with....they left it wide open for a sequel and i have no problem with that. this movie is all about explosions and jokes and a sequel isn't going to ruin anything....i hope that in the sequel i could get to know the transformers other than Prime and Bumblebee...other than that, rock on ;)","Jul 14, 2007",6,/10
"First I want to say that I was felt myself well entertained by this movie. The Visuals and the life action are very impressive, the acting is also acceptable for this kind of film. I truly loved the Score by Steve Jablonsky.But it's quite clear, that there cannot be a Summer blockbuster without nice little ""brainless"" moments as I call them.1. The humor which is presented in this feature is appropriate and funny in some scenes, but this does not mean that the writers have to ""squeeze out"" laughs during the hole movie2. Sometimes the film is just too cliché overloaded. It is useless to mention examples here, we know them all!In the end the this flaws do not catch up with the overall positive impression of the film, so that it's definitely worth a look!","Aug 1, 2007",8,/10
"I wasn't expecting a lot of a movie based on a TV show (which I've never seen) based on some toy. But Transformers look cool in advertisements so when it came to TV I decided to check it out, and it's actually a pretty decent movie. The action scenes are well done, the movie has a fast, consistent pace and I found myself surprisingly interested in what was happening.At the same time, this is not a great movie. The robots themselves are just silly stereotype caricatures, and the dopey humor doesn't jibe with the cleverer humor earlier in the movie (i.e. the car that plays songs appropriate to the situation. The robots fail to generate any real personality, so Shea LeBouf's emotional attachment to them doesn't make any sense. Although it might make sense to undemanding 10 year olds, who are probably this movie's primary target audience.Oddly enough, I found the movie less interesting as it proceeded from a cute action-comedy to a big action spectacular. The final scenes of mayhem were competently filmed, but there are none of those ""wow"" moments you get from really good big budget action pix. In fact, the most impressive thing in battles is the smooth transformation of robots from one form to the other, and by movie's end you've seen that enough to no longer be impressed.Overall the movie is a bit of a hack job, but it's a very entertaining hack job, and sometimes that's all you really need.","Sep 5, 2008",7,/10

Guess Michael Bay was concentrating too much on the computer generated imaginary aliens to focus on the stuff that actually exists on set.On the plus side, the script was hilarious, LeBeouf is convincing--as always--and the action was epic. It somehow managed to make the government look bad, but the troops still look good. If that's not a way into the heart of every fence-straddling American patriot, I don't know what is...Not bad for a 3 hour Hasbro/GM/Ipod/Mountain Dew commercial...I'm sure I'm missing some.

"First off, the movie focuses on humans which are very secondary to the story compared to the robot. It's called the ""Transformers"", not the winer BS problems of humans. Also, all the people writing about it and claiming that since they are in their 20's are inherently connected or knowledge worthy of said cartoon franchise are full of it. In a society filled with lazy ""time out"" generation parents and kids who have to have special ""playclothes"" for playing outside that they can't get dirty, yes the Transformers might seem a good movie. In the past when I have done critic writings for newspapers I have often stated ""as long as it entertains me"". This is not the case with this piece of garbage that Michael Bay has puked out. This is not entertaining, it is frustrating. Some of the worst dialog I have ever heard and seriously corrupt versions of iconic characters spew out in over 2 hours of CG/live action dullness. As stated, the serious dim-wits and people who can't handle life without a cellphone stuck to their ear will get this movie and like it as they are rarely asked to look beyond the internet for information or (god forbid) made to play outside with toys. This movie represents a farce and an insult to those of us who (actually) grew up watching this cartoon and having fun with the toys. Even if you can't comprehend life before the home computer, time-out Christian mother punishment, ipods, or the damn cellphone that can do everything, at least understand that this movie is just plain bad and an insult and that you would spend your time better trying to get the episodes of the original cartoon off of the internet.","Jul 7, 2007",1,/10

"and I'm not one of them. Transformers had impressive special effects. But the acting ws subpar and plot was written for a younger audience. Megan Fox's sweet bod was, in my opinion, the best part of the film (narrowly beating out the special effects) My roommate rented the video, so i paid exactly the right amount for it (nothing). Perhaps on the big screen the special effects would have been more captivating but i found myself glancing at the clock on the wall wondering how long the film was. I discovered it was 143 minutes long and I felt it was probably about 43 minutes too long. I can't believe that the entire story couldn't have been condensed at some points.Overall Transformers was an average film that had decent special effects to keep it from being a stinker. I give the Special Effects an 8 and the film as a whole a 4. Not good, not hideous and possibly better than anything i could have watched on TV tonight.Edit-After reviewing other comments, I realized that for many Transformers were part of childhood/growing up. I also remembered that in the 80's I was in high school and i was far more concerned with how to get into Tracy L's (I'll refrain from using her last name) pants than anything concerning toy robots. So I when into this film unbiased by childhood memories. ((Unlike when I watched the re-release of episode 4 (known as STAR WARS when I saw it back in 77-78)The trouble was that the kid that saw Star Wars was grown and the magic was lost in the tide of life)) Anyway, apparently lack lack of bias didn't help much, the film simply wasn't very good. At least I didn't feel part of my childhood memories were being violently tread upon (like others have implied). I also learned that a lot of the charm of the Transformers, the development of their personalities was apparently too (tedious? frivilous? unnecessary? expensive? useful? ) to be added to the movie. Shame.","Oct 30, 2007",7,/10
"I have always been a huge Transformers fan. I WANTED to enjoy this movie yet I can honestly say I can't remember ever being so disappointed in a film. I think I started to hate it when Bumblebee urinated on an FBI agent. Somewhere around there.*SPOILERS* First of all, to even say that this movie is about the Transformers is a bit misleading. In reality, it's about Shia LeBouf's character with appearances by the Transformers. When I go see a movie about the Transformers, I want to see more than one scene containing a conversation between those characters.In fact, the Transformers were so poorly characterized, that when Megatron and Optimus Prime actually do fight, I don't even give a crap, because I feel like I barely know them. Megatron has about five lines and he doesn't even show up until literally 2 hours into the film. And I sure don't want to sit through a lame-ass love story when there is plenty of Autobot and Decepticon action to be watching.The entire film is completely unfocused. It's completely unclear what the Decepticons are doing on Earth and whether or not that Megatron is even the leader. And even though each Decepticon introduces themselves, afterwards it's almost impossible to tell them apart.Another thing that really bugged me was the films annoying obsession with this sitcom-type humor. Don't get me wrong, I love some comedy in my action movies, but the silly lowbrow comedy just didn't go with the attempt to set the action in a real-world setting. There were genuinely funny parts, of course, but I was so annoyed with the potty humor junk that it was hard to enjoy them.Obviously there are many people who have posted positive reviews of this film and they're entitled to their opinion. I guess they just have an ability to enjoy senseless overly long movies with no substance that I don't.","Jul 6, 2007",2,/10
"Transformers ranks at #3 for my favorite movies of all time. This is one of the coolest concepts and easily delivers. Most impressively from this movie is its quotable lines.

"I have to admit I loved this film and, perhaps, as someone who was a child in the Eighties at the height of the Transformers craze has some bearing on that. I was a tomboy who loved the toys and watched the cartoon on Saturday mornings so there is a certain amount of sentimental nostalgia when watching this film. However, that doesn't detract from the fact this was a very enjoyable blockbuster.The premise of 'Transformers' sees war between two robotic races-- the Autobots, who are good and honourable, and the Decepticons, who are evil and cruel-- on the planet of Cybertron as they are vying for control of the powerful Allspark weapon. The weapon eventually finds its way to Earth but, in his search for it, the leader of the Decepticons, Megatron, is frozen in the polar ice cap. Years later, seventeen-year-old Sam buys his first car, unaware it is Bumblebee, one of the Autobots who have come to Earth to find the Allspark. War again is looming between the Autobots and Decepticons, this time with Earth as the battleground.The human characters of Sam, his girlfriend Mikaela, the military and government people aren't irritating distractions from the robots. Sam is old enough to realistically be embroiled in this situation without coming across as some precocious little moppet who should be tucked at home in bed and we should be thankful they chose the main character to be seventeen instead of ten. Shia LeBeouf, who played Sam, brought humour and the human touch to the film. It also made a pleasant change to see the military portrayed to have some brains instead of carrying on like a bunch of reckless fools who make moronic decisions time-and-again.As for the robots, the CGI used was of excellent quality. The visual effects were able to re-create them in a manner that doesn't leave the audience sitting there thinking, 'this is so fake', which would have ruined the film. The robots were also depicted in a manner that gave them individual personalities that brought their characters to life, which was essential because these aren't meant to be mindless drones.This film is, ultimately, a Hollywood blockbuster, not some deep-thinking epic. People do need to remember that when judging 'Transformers'. The plot is involving without requiring a vast intellect or powerful thoughts and yes, there are plenty of explosions and fight scenes. Take it for what it is and I imagine many people upwards of twelve who just want to see a fun film will enjoy this. It is definitely a must for those in their twenties who grew up with Transformers; nothing like re-living your childhood once again!","Jul 28, 2007",,

"Transformers is an old and lovable Franchise first as a toy then a TV series in the 80's and 90's. I have been a fan of Transformers since I was a small child and I own the 1987 movie(I love it). I always thought a Live Action Transformers film would be a cool idea but would never live up to the original cartoon...but I was wrong.Transformers was an epic movie for all ages, Transformers fan or not, and has a great blend of humor and action. Oh, the special effects in this movie are the best I have ever seen, PERIOD! When the transformation from vehicle to robot starts you can see every little gear move and go into place..Flawless! One of the best things they did for this movie was bringing Peter Cullen in for the original voice of Optimus Prime. I remember that voice perfectly from the show and its just so refreshing to hear again.The only Reason I did not give this movie a 10-10 was because the character development and interactions of the Decepticons was lame but I guess they can do more of that in the sequel. 9-10","Apr 30, 2008",9,/10

The scenes between him & his family were hilarious. Megan Fox? Yowza!!!The dialog was pretty lame for the Autobots......pretty much like the original cartoon. One thing is certain - Michael Bay is so wrapped up in his ""genius"" that he doesn't know how to edit a film. Less would have equated to more for Transformers. Besides, it's worthy of a sequel. No need to squeeze every possible action sequence into this film. The redundancy tarnished Tranformers' overall appeal.All the Transformers impressed me w/ the exception of MegaTron. They should have introduced a more ""true-to-the-original"" MegaTron earlier in the story.But really, this was a fun film. Surprisingly, it was also a great movie-going experience for me.

"I saw Transformers the other night and even though I wasn't disappointed, my expectations weren't exceeded. First off, this is a very cheesy movie. However, I can understand this. If you are going to see a movie about fighting robots who transform into vehicles, you have to be able to expect a cheesy aspect to the film. I even thought that some of the cheesiness was funny and was also good addition that brought a good sense of humor to the movie. However, the real downfall of the movie is the directing. I mean the casting was good, the CG was good, the script was alright, and the everything else was pretty decent. However, when it came to Michael Bay, I was disappointed, just like I am when I see most of his movies. I think he has potential, but he is still young and has to discover more of his talent. Really, that is the only complaint I have about the movie. Transformers was one of the better movies I have seen this summer (unfortunately thats not saying much) and I will probably buy it on DVD. However, Michael Bay took the my rating down to a 6.5 out of 10. Hopefully Transformers 2 will be better.","Jul 6, 2007",6,/10
"This movie was almost as bad as Spider-Man 3. What a disappointing summer for movies (besides Borne 3) While watching this movie i was confused, was it suppose to be an action film? Cause the action was difficult to follow when they were in the city. The ""humor"" was uncalled for when it was presented. The whole government agency was alright at first then they turned into a bunch of idiots that had t-shirts made. That what my high school sports team did. The love story was the worst i've seen since Star Wars episode 2, simply dreadful. The rest of the dialog was bad, the movie also featured horrible lines that just highlighted the lack of acting talent Michael bay picked. The worst part was the blatant ads through out the movie, cars, cellphones, clothes, and drinks were thrown in your face the entire time. The shot would start out on the GM symbol then after 30 secs span out to see the cars only to focus of the Chevy symbol next. I would have walked out and gotten my money back but my friend drove me so i had no where to go.......Michael Bay is making the sequel, both should be stopped from ever seeing the light of day","Nov 27, 2007",1,/10
"This movie is about the cartoon ""Transformers"" that is a very popular TV series in the United States of America. I wasn't really interested in the cartoon but watching the movie makes you want to see the cartoon because this movie is AWESOME. The Autobots are going after something they need so that the Decepticons won't get it and destroy the world because it gives them much more power. The only problem is that Megatron was found frozen many years back in the North of the world so they are sort of experimenting on him. They all get in a big war in the middle of the movie that makes the movie even more exciting and the plot is very good.","Sep 27, 2007",9,/10

"I like fantastic movies. I like funny movies. I love war movies.I like unrealistic movies. I even like stupid, tasteless crazy movies just for the fun of watching them.But this...+5 points for funny dialogues and a great cast, +10 points for cutting edge breathtaking visual effects, -99 for the silliest plot ever. Mixing dying US soldiers in the desert with utter nonsense in terms of warfare, technology, command procedures, and most of all, respect and realism, without being ironic or attempting to carry any message is even an outrage (and I'm not even American). Hell, I loved the funny stereotypes of ""True Lies"", enjoyed the nonsense way of fighting in ""starship troopers"", I stood up and cheered when the president lead the F18 attack in the patriotic overkill of independence day, I fought with infantry (and cavalry) in ""war of the worlds"", I ducked ricochets in the streets of Mogadishu when our black hawk went down and even cried like a baby when gandalf arrived with the rohirrim at helm's clam. I love xmen, I adore nearly any marvel movie made.Even for kids, this can never be a classic. Top Gun is a classic movie, and it's silly, unrealistic and even stupid. But we love it. TrAnsformers...will not be remembered by anyone in 5 years...why? It lacks any form of consistent atmosphere and treats the audience like toddlers.But to be honest, for the cast, this is the best movie I've ever aborted after watching it for 30 painful minutes.","Dec 16, 2007",1,/10

I don't claim to know much about the original transformers in fact i know hardly anything. After seeing this movie i sorta wish i did. It has stunning special effects paired with extraordinary sound and a bunch of recognizable actors. Even if you don't know about the show you should know that Optimus Prime and his buddy the autobots take on megatron and the decepticons. In this movie their is a cube that has the power to turn things into robots that the bad guys want to harness to destroy the world and the autobots need to stop it. The first part of the movie sets the stage and their is some great humor paired with some skirmishes. The Real action starts when the big battle between the autobots and decepticons begin fighting.At some points their were too many robots and i didn't know who they were and the decepticons personality's were not shown at all. It wasn't that big of a deal as the big picture is the battle between good and evil. Transformers is a great movie for anybody to see not just the fanatics of the show. It has the potential to be the best blockbuster of the summer.,"Jul 3, 2007",,
"TRANSFORMERS More than meets the eye? So the release is right around the corner of one of the most anticipated movies of the year. But is the anticipation worth it? A good bunch of us have grown up with Transformers, we know the stories, we know the TV show, the movies, and of course, those kick-ass action figures. Finally after all the years we get a live action full blown Hollywood production of the story. I'd like to write this without giving much away, since it is quite a movie, but I'll start with a summary.Basically we have the ""cube"" or better know as the ""All Spark"". This cube has the utmost power to the Transformers, which are fighting over it. Two clans of Transformers exist, the Autobots, and the Decepticons. Both of them want the cube, but one side is good, and the other evil, respectively. At some point in time this cube was lost, and both sides go from planet to planet searching for it. Guess where their last place to look is? That's right, Earth. The story has multiple character sets it follows, one being a soldier in the US Army, another being a teenager, a group of a ""signal analysis"" team, and the Secretary of Defense. All of these tie in at one point and all reach conflicts and disaster.Story = 8/10 Now normally, this story may be a little ""weak"" in terms of normal story telling, but since it has been around and evolved throughout the decades, it is widely accepted and interesting to audiences. It's quite an easy tale to grasp, but greats amount of detail can be placed to it. The overall picture is about the Transformers, but we do get a look into the other character's lives and what they are going through with all of this happening. Some of the story is week in character development, and catches some rather cliché moments, but hold strong to what's going on.Script/Acting = 4.5/10 Ouch. Some of the lines and dialog in this movie were awful, and a good handful of the acting was either dry or overdone, but with the other characteristics of the film adding to this, the movie stays strong.Sound = 10/10 Whomever did the sound design and effects for this film deserves a true award. Every single action and nut or bolt had it's own sound, each being unique. I truly enjoyed the sound, and would buy a sound effect archive of just the effects played in the movie, they were fabulous.Visual Effects = 10/10 These are hands down the best effects I have ever seen. I see A LOT of movies, and as with a lot of the community love them, and this movie by far surpasses everything I've seen before this. The animations and transformations of the bots is flawless, the wreckage and explosions and everything is just jaw-dropping, it was perfect. I don't see how they could have improved anymore than this, seriously. Now I truly believe it took over 32 hours to render one frame. There was only ONE, ONE one second scene where I could tell it was fake, and it was a splash of water near the end of the film. Other than that, it was just beautiful.Length = 144 minutes.Yep, almost 2 1/2 hours of pure Transformers, pretty sick, eh? Overall = 8.8/10 No I didn't average this score, but this movie does deliver. It's enjoyable and will want you asking for a little piece more. It was a good time, and is worth seeing.Oh yeah. And that new Camaro is in it. Nice car indeed.","Jul 2, 2007",7,/10
"I saw the poster for the movie a long time ago..can't remember when...but I immediately came online and searched for any info I could find. I saw a few shots..and thought to myself...oh no..they're gonna ruin my childhood memories of Transformers...every boy's favourite cartoon around the 80's. When the OFFICIAL marketing for the movie began..and I realised it was Michael Bay AND Steven Spielberg behind the movie...I knew it was in good hands. The marketing was very well done...lovely trailers..especially the full trailer which is the one that begins with Sam's father taking him to look for his first car.The opening scenes in the movie were action packed...wow...Blackout was wicked!!! I went to the opening night and I was smiling from beginning to end and my friends thought I was going mad...but I was just so excited. Bumblebee plays a very important role in the movie and his character was cool. Michael Bay made you feel attached to Bumblebee. He was a true soldier as anyone watching the movie will realise as the movie develops. The plot was a simple plot..not cheesy..just simple..but c'mon...it's Transformers..what do you expect. It was still done very well...and the special effects were top quality...nothing looked fake. The introduction to the autobots and the decepticons,but mainly the autobots, made me feel like a kid again. WOW!! I want to thank Michael Bay for staying true to the fans..especially in attaching Peter Cullen to reprise his role as the voice of Optimus Prime..it just wouldn't be the same without him. Megatron was pure destruction and the fight between him and Prime was wicked...pure mayhem and destruction in the city. Oh yeah..look out for when any of the robots transform in mid-movement....damn awesome!!! I don't really root for bad guys..but honestly..Starscream and Blackout were just cool. By the way, after watching the movie..went home to dig out my old Super Optimus Prime. Plan to get the new toys too...and they're for me(27yrs) and not for my nephew and I don't have kids. Haha. It's the movie!! It's just SO splendid and brought back wonderful memories. Can't wait 'til the sequel. SPLENDID!!!","Jul 24, 2007",9,/10
"Transformers delivers what its supposed to ..... for a transforming robots movie. However, as an official Transformers movie, I find it way below potential. The transformation animation was excellent, though the camera was too close to the action to see it clearly in many scenes. i would also have preferred them to look a little less spiky and just a tad more like the original design of the 80s. It was most excellent to see the autobots together and the various homages to old school material was done well (transforming noises, catch phrases, the dam scene from the cartoon pilot). The dialogue was typical summer fare which seemed dumbed down in many places and a few scenes were just plain ludicrous. A side note for the director, if you have to have more human time because of budget, please make those scenes more believable than the invading alien robots that transform scenes. It has the love story thrown in but was done halfway decent with just a few 'groan inducing' moments. I overall enjoyed the movie though it could have been better, much better, epic even but then again it could have been worse. There was too much needless sexual innuendo for my taste throughout imo. Its as if transforming robots who want to completely destroy each other isn't enough to keep the attention of the audience?! My biggest beef with the movie is the same with most movies in that too much time was given to the humans rather than to the robots or aliens, etc. As the movie progresses, not enough time was given to learn the robots personality (Starscream and Megatron for example). I do think it captures some of the cartoon feel yet it is still squashed by too much human time. My BIGGEST want for the next movie would be more robot time and some good back and forth dialogue between them, not just action. And of course Devastator would be nice; The REAL ""Your Destruction is Imminent"" Devastator, hint hint. ""Transform and roll out"" (stupid traffic, if only my car was a transformer :)","Jul 5, 2007",7,/10
"Michael Bay seems to have a certain philosophy when directing films, when in doubt, blow it up. This has gained him a mixed reputation as a director, some applause him for his ability to blockbusters, while other's think he is a shallow, untalented director.So when it was announced that he would direct the big screen adaptation of a cartoon series which has a huge cult following, as you can imagine, the reaction was mixed. It is therefore could to see that he has defied expectations and made an extremely enjoyable film.Lets get one thing straight first, this film is about robots fighting robots. It does not have any serious issues in the plot, any social commentary in the concept or any intense conversations. It is about robots fighting robots. Therefore, those with any sense should expect this to be fully loaded, brain-pumping and mind blowing as cinema should get. Bay gives us all this, and proves that he is one of people to go to in making kick-ass action movies. The set pieces are incredible, the CGI believable, and explosions breathtaking. Sometimes it seems a little too much, but when you 30ft robots firing missiles and toppling cars, you be foolish not to expect that.Another great thing that helps the film is the comedy. Bay who is no stranger to the genre with films like Armageddon and Bad Boys I+II gives us some hilarious gags, which work great with the rest of the film. The scene in which the transformers search for the glasses at Sam (Shia LaBouef)'s house is a great example of slapstick, and keeps the film on the light tone which makes it so enjoyable. Shia LaBouef is terrific on-screen, and gives the film it's best performance. A natural comedian, he has a great blend of Woody Allen wit and Tom Hanks In-willing hero which makes him a very entertaining lead. Watch out for his scenes with John Torturro, as the two have great gravity on-screen.","Jul 28, 2007",8,/10

"I first heard about this movie last year when it was being filmed, it would be the big Hollywood action summer film of 2007. This made me very excited and I also enjoyed the original teaser trailer. Then I finally saw this film in some old cinema during a holiday, I entered the theatre with a expectation. So, what did I get? I got a trashy, painfully written, horribly directed piece of garbage. So basically, all the familiar Robots from the old series are back, but that does not help this awful movie. First of all, it is directed by Michael Bay, Who couldn't have done an even worse job on this film. He hasn't brought anything original back to the screen and, instead, has decided to rely on extremely poor editing and CGI to give us the action scenes. This could be his worse movie to date. Performances on this film are not good, but that is the least of this film's issues. I mostly blame the film's script which is worth 30 minutes of a short movie into a 2 hour film making it very stretched. But thats okay! Mr. Bay has relied on senseless editing to make this film out of control. As a result, I almost fell asleep at an action scene (something that I have never done before). Unlike some decent action flicks, the storyline to this film is incredibly unintelligent, and left me unimpressed. If there is one positive thing I could say about this film, it is that it has some good CGI effects, but is that all? Now this film has been rated PG-13, however that doesn't stop my 9-year old cousin from watching it. Now personally, I have no problem with this, but when it came to a extensive scene with sexual humour, I was caught completely off guard. I see absolutely no reason why this is this is in the finished cut, and to have that type of joke in a film that is based upon a huge kid-friendly franchise, this is extremely inappropriate. However if there is a age level which would appreciate this the most, it would be teenagers. Now judging by the story's sub-plot, this is kind of a teen action film, rather than a sensible family film, so with that said, this movie fails yet again. Now I thought that The Simpsons Movie would disappoint me and that this movie would blow me away, amazingly, it did the complete opposite. Now unless you praise the film with good CGI, I can see absolutely no reason why anyone could enjoy this film, otherwise you have been brainwashed by cheesy Hollywood tripe. After the longest 2 hours of my life, my buttocks were ruined, my ears were bleeding and I had witnessed a film that was just unbelievably bad. Just bad! This film succeeded to disappoint me in every way. All I can say is if this film was made a decade back, and with a different film crew, this movie would be good. But I'm sorry, but they left this movie last, all the good action movies have been made, and only a good director could bring the old magic to life again. Now I have run out of words to say, so I will give you a simple overall: This film is too fast, yet too slow.","Nov 23, 2007",1,/10
"Great movie.Although the plot and concept were actually quite a no-brainer, it pulled it off really well. The romance didn't feel too tacky, the emotional moments really felt emotional (which was a disappointment in, for example ""Iron Man""), the robots were of course awesome and the script was solid and funny. Top notch.The high score mainly comes from the fact that it felt philosophical as well. It wasn't really that strongly intelligent, but it does put you to think. The end monologue by OP also felt really moving.Altogether a great movie and I can't put my finger on why this movie has a 7.5 and a movie like iron man has an 8.3. When the quality of both movies is objectively viewed, I'd definitely switch the scores.Anyway, definitely recommended. I hope they don't make a sequel. I usually feel they should go on with the concept, but this is just one story and it should remain that way. Keeps us guessing. They kinda ruined Pirates that way, if you ask me.","Jun 11, 2008",8,/10
"OK.I am one of ""those guys"" - I'm 30, I grew up being a huge fan of the Generation 1 Transformers. I still enjoy the concept, have a couple TF toys on shelves in my home office, that kind of thing. TF was my own ""Star Wars"" - the latter never having appealed strongly to me.Still, I knew I was going to see the movie regardless, just to see what they had done. Bay's movies have been basic no-thinking popcorn flicks that I haven't hated, so I wasn't biased against the directing at least. My girlfriend was equally excited, also a child of the 80s even though TF wasn't her toon of choice back then.I'm not going to detail the plot, as so many reviewers have done so before me. I just wanted to point out some things as one of those grew-up-on-it fanboys.The humor: It was good, for the most part. We all laughed many times in the theater. A couple of jokes were pretty bad (Bumblebee drenching Turturro), a couple scenes a bit too long (hiding in Sam's back yard), and ""My bad"" a gauche line for a noble character; but overall, lots of genuine laughs. Sam was babbling and neurotic (especially in the early parts), like Woody Allen on a speedball, and that got old pretty quickly - but at least he slid in a clever retort here and there.The plot: Not G1, but acceptable, decently conceived and fairly sensical. Sure, it's absurd to think sentient, advanced technological beings would need the help of a 17-year-old kid to find an artifact, but it was fine. Open end allows for a sequel quite easily, but it's fairly sewn-up as a oneshot if necessary. One plot device that I figured wasn't fantastic, would have been better if it was explained to the viewers (Sam does something crucial at the end of the movie, but we're not told how or even *if* he comes to the conclusion that it would work - a little thinking on the viewer's part is needed there).And by the way, I was struck by the sheer lack of TOTAL HYSTERIA that would ensue were even one giant robot appear in any city whatsoever. There were people close enough to the robot battles to almost be hit by them. I would assume those streets would have been EMPTY at the first quaking footfall of *any* of the robots.The bots: Many fans, myself included, were fairly angry at the new looks of our favorite characters as presented in promotional stills. Just not enough of the old charm in the new look, I thought. As for the vehicle modes, I somewhat understood the German car manufacturers' position on Jazz and Bumblebee, but the changing of Prime's truck form so drastically I didn't understand. As for the robot modes - wow, a billion moving parts all at once, huh? Hmmm, I suppose it makes more sense from a robotic-biology standpoint...Anyways - I came away from the film truly thinking of Optimus Prime as Optimus Prime. His color scheme, vehicle mode, and even that one awful line, were not enough to take the character away from himself. Peter Cullen had a huge part in making that a reality, too, and I hope he reprises again in any sequels to be made. Bumblebee was fun and likable, but not *quite* his old self... Aside from Prime, I'd say Jazz was closest to his original character. Ironhide was okay, but I think I remember the G1 Ironhide being more like an old veteran soldier than a hair-triggered munitions expert. Ratchet was the Spock of the away team here, perfectly functional and without exuberance. I don't really remember his cartoon self as much as the others'. The Decepticons were similarly almost-there. Megatron was every bit as menacing as, although there wasn't enough time to give him the sinister criminal mind of, his G1 self. Starscream was VERY de-characterized, having almost no personality, especially compared to the classic version. The baddies were plenty destructive, true to form, and at least they weren't limited to a scheme that would have been a 22-minute plot-foiling-waiting-to-happen in 1983. Oh, and Frenzy was annoying as hell - but I'm glad they saved Soundwave for the future instead of forcing the angular spider-bot on us with that iconic name.Speaking of icons: surprisingly to me, Devastator was the one character I had the most complaint about the change to. In the movie a heavily armed and armored tank, but in the cartoon series a gestalt of five large construction vehicles forming a massive robot. THAT would have been 1. worth the title ""Devastator"", G1 nod or not, and 2. A *very* cool (and large) thing for the viewers to behold.VFX: Everything looked good, realistic as could be done with so many moving parts... I think they stretched the existent mass as far as could go without actually increasing the amount, sometimes, considering a car the size of that Camaro turned into such a huge robot, for example. When he reverted to car-mode from bot-mode as the 2009 Camaro concept, I really had to ask myself ""Now if all that went in there, how is there going to be seating space for Sam and the girl, guys?""Additionally, I'm sure you've read it already, but some of the fight scenes were shown too close to see what exactly was being done on the screen.All in all: I really enjoyed it, and while some of the faults I found with it were fairly big (to me), the overall presentation was good enough to keep the issues at bay. Don't expect Academy awards, don't expect your childhood right there on the screen, just sit back and enjoy. My girlfriend loved it so much she wants to see it again before it's left the theaters.","Jul 5, 2007",7,/10
"First of all, let me get this out of the way: yes, I'm a long-time Transformers fan. However, I am by no means a purist (my favorite TF series was Beast Wars), and I'm not giving this movie a low rating simply because they changed things from the original series. The franchise has gone through so many reboots, retoolings and new continuities that it never even occurred to me to be upset about the idea of another one. That's not to say that there weren't elements of this movie that I had problems with as a fan, but they had little to do with my overall opinion of the movie.Since it's the least important element of this review, I'll get the fan-related stuff out of the way first. All of these are things I could easily have overlooked if the rest of the movie had been in any way good, so unless you really care about this stuff, feel free to skip down to the next paragraph. Obviously, the designs were one issue I had. In no way was I expecting a direct translation of their G1 forms, but if they're going to keep the classic names, they could at least give the other characters the respect they gave Prime by making them at least somewhat recognizable. Just look at the G1 repaint of the Starscream toy, for example; some different heads and more G1-based paint jobs could have done wonders. Also on the design front, I didn't like Bumblebee being a top-of-the-line sports car and Starscream's robot mode being very hulking and brutish, as I felt those choices went in the exact opposite direction of the spirit of their namesakes (Bumblebee being the not-too-fast, not-too-strong underdog with a lot of heart, and Starscream being a character who relied on his speed, agility and cunning rather than brute force). On the story side, I disliked the inference that Prime and Megatron were brothers (although at least it wasn't explicitly stated like in the draft script). Also, the statement by the producers that they couldn't do Soundwave because ""the audience wouldn't believe the whole mass-shifting thing"" kind of loses its weight when you have a 20-story cube compress itself to about the size of a basketball.As far as the script goes, it was downright awful. It tried to be way too many things, and pulled them all off poorly. It kept jumping haphazardly and without warning between alien invasion explosion-fest, military/war film, bad teenage romance, government conspiracy movie, and tech/hacker ""thriller,"" each of which had its own unique pacing that didn't mesh with that of any of the other story lines. There were unnecessary plot lines, scenes that were pointless and/or way too long (most notably the failed attempt at comedy that was the yard scene, which was both), characters and plot lines that were just forgotten about, and more plot holes than I could count. The few characters that got any development at all (who were almost all human) were incredibly stereotypical. The Decepticons (who have always been my faction of choice) in particular suffered a severe lack of character development, being reduced to ""bad guys who destroy things."" The dialogue was no better, rife with stilted phrasing, clunky exposition, and instances of natural flow being sacrificed for forced references to sponsoring products. The result was a script so hollow and generic that while I could easily predict what would happen (after all, I'd seen it a hundred times before in different, much better movies), I didn't really care enough to do so.As for the acting, Shia did a decent job considering how little he had to work with, but he's always rubbed me the wrong way for some reason. Still, if you don't mind his other work you'll probably like him here. Megan Fox's performance was what you'd expect; she's there for her looks, not her acting ability. The rest of the live cast were either dumbfoundingly hammy (Turtorro), clearly phoning it in (Voight), or utterly forgettable (pretty much everyone else). The voice actors, though, particularly Peter Cullen, did a great job despite the lousy script. It's a shame they got so few lines.Finally, there was the direction, which was definitively Michael Bay. Like many trendy directors, his philosophy seems to be that the shakier the camera and the more cuts you make, the more ""intense"" an action scene becomes. Unfortunately, it almost always ends up turning it into a confused mess. That proves to be all the more true when the focus of the scene is two incredibly complex CG robots in a hand-to-hand brawl. As a result, one of the film's few redeeming features (ILM's impressive special effects) is largely wasted in baffling fight scenes that come across as a large moving pile of spiky metal pieces rather than two robots fighting for their lives.Overall, this was easily the worst new film I've seen all year. There are only three things that kept me from giving this awful movie a 1. First of all, Peter Cullen and the rest of the voice cast performed admirably. Second, as I said, the CG itself was amazing, as wasted as it was. Finally, there were a couple of fleeting moments where I did get a mild ""it's a live-action Transformers movie!"" rush (mostly due to Cullen). Unfortunately, they were brief, few and far between, and occurred only when the robots stayed relatively still, as that's the only time I could really tell what I was looking at. And that tiny thrill is more than negated by the fact that I can no longer wear my Decepticon logo shirt (which, until this movie came out, was one of my favorite shirts) without the hassle of explaining to strangers who try to start conversations about it that I thought it was an utterly lousy movie.","Sep 27, 2007",2,/10
"This movie is actually the best one in the genre (if you see '80s cartoons as a movie genre). It has a lot of funny moment, while the plot is being built up. It has very few of the original transformers (there are like 5 Autobots and 5 Decepticons) but they all have a personality and they really act accordingly (although Prime is a bit less static than wee remember him). The movie is a rock solid 8 out of 10. So why did I give it 9 out of 10? In the original movie (cartoon movie) there is a fight between Megatron and Optimus Prime, Prime says it's the final show down ""one shall walk, one shall fall"". I really loved that and this new movie honors that. Like the little bumblebee in the windscreen of Bumblebee, the ""more than meets the eye"" theme is worked into the movie and the only thing they neglected is to put (a new version of) the old theme in with the end titles. Maybe in the next one ;)","Jul 28, 2007",9,/10
"Just two days ago I went to watch 'Transformers' with my brother. As a kid I initially hated the cartoon but later grew to like it. My summary pretty much explains the movie. I enjoyed the film because I liked some of the comic scenes, special effects, the action and funny appearances of famous actors. Also, all the robots and cars were pretty cool and fun to watch. About the plot, well who cares? The acting...well who cares? I wasn't expecting a great screenplay or standout performances. But if 'Transformers'scored high on those two, I really would have liked it a whole lot more. There weren't really that many hot chicks (which you expect in this kind of films) but the two I saw were hot enough. Visuals, special effects and sound were brilliant. Lots of action which slows down a bit in the second half until the end. An excellent background score (with two tracks from Linkin Park). Like I said, it's an enjoyable but dodgy rough visual ride (for many).","Jul 15, 2007",,
"The film - what you'd expect from Michael Bay. Big, brash, dumb, peppered with irritating plot holes. Thin clichéd characterisation, fetishising military hardware, fetishising ridiculous bloated SUV vehicles. Incoherent and confusing action with diminishing returns (by the third hour, we are really getting sick of watching giant robots punching each other). All that regular stuff. Oh yeah - and at least half the movie takes place at magic hour. It's like sucking on a giant chrome exhaust pipe, while someone hits you over the head, while shining an orange lamp in your face.My point is a small one - but why is that American film makers (and audiences?) find it so hard to accept that other countries in the world have high technology? OK, in the movie we get a crack about the robot probably being Japanese, and about Nokia phones coming from Finland - but what the heck is the point of having a character describe the failed Mars lander ""Beagle 2"" as ""NASA/JPL"", when in fact it was a British craft, carried on a European Space Agency mission! Yes, America, sorry if it upsets you, but Europe (and Japan, and India, and China etc etc) all have space programs!!!!!","Aug 15, 2007",6,/10
"When my brother manacled me into going to the theater with him in order to watch Transformers, I felt I was going to have the worst night of my life. I remembered the cartoons, and kind of liked them, but it wasn't as if I actually was a fan or anything. Of course, I remembered Optimus Prime and did hope to see him on screen.So the movie started, and I tell you, my mouth has been opened for the complete opening scene. So many things happen, so many things take place, that I was utterly stunned. As Micheal Bay is not a great director (understatement of the century) he needs to get his audience's attention in the first couple of minutes. Well, he sure got me!Transformers has superb graphics; the CGI is amazing. The way Bumblebee transforms, as if it's something that you see everyday. Compliments to those who did that stuff.But I've got to state something. This is a real guy's movie. It's got hot chicks, (yes, I agree, they look great in their skinny bikini type clothes and botox lips)war, fast cars (especially the 'new' Bumblebee, what a fine car) and heroism. What's in it for girls to watch? Well, it's exciting, and the guys are OK. Don't get your hopes up though; this is a typical boys-night-out movie and if you take your BF he might be a little too interested in either the leading chick or the Australian lady. But, whatever suits you!And compliments to Jon Voight. He's still cool, save the Anaconda part.Go and watch this movie, expect great CGI, babes, cool music and excitement. Don't expect a great story, deep characters or a message. It's summer.","Aug 2, 2007",8,/10
"Michael Bay's new blockbuster is doing well in the theater. It takes the 80s cartoons premise and puts in the the 21st century with cell phones and ebay...The story is not the strong point of the movie. Afterall, this is based on material made for kids in order to incite them to buy toys. I was one of these kids in the 80s and still have some Transformers somewhere at my mother's house, so I was familiar with the concept, although not hardcore--for instance, I knew about Optimus Prime and Megatron, but only remembered of Bumble Bee once they mentioned his name; I recognized some robots, but no other names. This movie was partly targeted to my demographic that regard this as nostalgic of our youth, but also to a new generation of kids & teenagers.Once you accept that the story is going nowhere fast, the movie is quite successful. It has one-dimensional characters, but excellent one-liners. What surprised me the most from Bay, which I regard highly in terms of action sequences, is that the humor was better than the action. The CGI work was good (not great) and some interesting action finally occurred near the end. I'm thinking of a few great shots in the street like a transformer that jumps over a woman in slow motion... but overall the action was not up to par to Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor & Bad Boys II in my humble opinion.The comedy did work for me and my friends though. We laughed quite a bit and a few nods were there for the casual fans of Transfomers like myself.Overall, this movie was an entertaining summer flick. Do not expect a masterpiece, but expect to be thoroughly entertained for 144mins. Oh yeah, I almost forget for those who care, but the two female leads are hot, very hot. Sure to give a few more tickets sales for a movie like this. But with Bay, it's mostly all jokes and eye-candy anyway.Lastly, there is quite a bit of product placement, mainly GM & eBay. What can you do in a world that revolves not only around the Sun, but around money...","Jul 20, 2007",7,/10
"After seeing the most anticipated movie of Summer 07, which was the corny Spiderman 3, and seeing Shrek 3 crumble, and Pirates getting lost in its subplots, the summer of 07 looked bleak when 4 months ago it had an all-star lineup. Then came the hilarious Knocked Up, a dismal and even cornier Fantastic Four 2, and a cliché Oceans 13. Then, it was time for the Independence Day Openers where Ratatouille cooked up a raving reviews. Finally, Transformers was released which exceeded my weary expectations and millions of others. The movie has the most simple, easy and cliché plot set up where two robotic races fight on earth in search of a higher power that a human unknowingly possesses. The plot is stupid, but it worked. Summer blockbusters since the mid 90's have had gaping plot holes, lapses and corny dialogue that critics sensationalize and zoom in on in their reviews. One could argue, that in almost every summer blockbuster the people's grade always is higher than the critics. However, I am fan of most of those blockbuster movies, I even enjoyed Armageddon. The story again is childish, but thats its purpose and the movie has a keen awareness of that, which gives respect to the eclectic viewer. Some critics call this set up garbage, which it is but most viewers ironically find the beauty in that garbage. The entire movie is pure, flashy, loud, intense entertainment. In fact, what critics seem dumbfounded on is, that is the contemporary definition of entertainment, loud, flashy, intense. (Think theme parks). Transformers is a roller coaster thrill ride that has immensely long lines of eager viewers waiting to experience it. Critics are baffled by the worlds taste of entertainment and disappointed in this, making them somewhat pompous but paradoxically sincere. The movie ultimately has no dull moments unlike in Pirates 3 where many were abundant. The movie's pacing is what keeps the viewer distracted from its corniness. The editing is top-notch where the viewer is given not many chances to see the action from a stationary pov. Though, I and many others like that flashy and quick editing, which takes away any dullness and sharpens the entertainment. This is in no way tailored for people who don't like frenetic shots, or quick in yo face visuals. This movie is tailored for thrill-seekers and it is one of the best. Shia Labeouf, a fast and rising genuine actor, like many people have said is the glue of the film. His performance makes everything seem real, his performance pays respect to the audience which gives his character dignity. His relationship with his car, is the aspect of the movie that drew me in. A guys relationship with his car has its special overtones that are found in this movie. At the end of the movie I shockingly found myself caring for Bumblebee and Sam. This relationship in the movie subtlety brought partially profound human emotion to the table, something usually absent from blockbusters shallow and ""convenient"" emotion.The Visual/Special/Sound/Bay effects polished and polished this movie, until it became a beacon for pure eye candy. The photo-realistic robots battling out amongst humans is breathtaking. The transformations are so cool. The Transformers themselves I found a little on the dumb side, but what i think many missed is that the Transformers are almost mirroring society. Though stereotypical it is what it is, most people are hypocrites when they so adamantly state stereotypes are bad, when they are typing every day. The Transformers, basically picked up and were influenced by the media and entertainment side of society according to the script. Very clever aspect of the screenplay. Despite its shortcomings in plot, weak supporting human characters, the movie transforms these weaknesses into pure entertainment. This is the next Pirates. Hopefully its sequel wont parallel the Pirates sequels. 8.5/10 cause IMDb needs to get a better grading system.","Jul 18, 2007",9,/10

"After reading some of the posts on the TRansformers, I know why things are going downhill in this country. They called someone a ""prude"" and that sounds like a compliment after reading the other comments bashing this person. Listen, idiots. Yeah you, the ones that think they're so cool and tough. Take a reality pill. The truth is you're a bunch of immature, gutter mouth, mentally unbalanced freaks. I'm sure you see nothing wrong with a 3 year old saying ""Ma'. Get me some F@#$ food!"" That's how you would raise your kids? Figures! Keep worshiping your Ozzy Osborne God and let everyone else be. This movie sucked. The plot sucked, the acting sucked...the only good thing was the computer generated robots (yeah,Transformers). By the way, there was no relevance to the plot whatsoever with the masturbating scene. It was not funny, and who cares about this neurotic teen, anyway. It's obvious his condition is genetic since the parents act just as idiotic as he does. Who cares about them either.

"Transformers is a great show for 30 min, you have a lots of explosion and satisfying visual effects such as the metamorphose of Autobots in car, but the major problem is that the the scenario's blank spaces are filled with those explosions. At the end, the scenario is so poor in substance that you understand the story join the movie in the last 30 minutes. Everything becomes repetitive.

"Oh how I longed for this Movie. A Transformers Movie. How could it be anything other that amazing. I'll tell you how... Michael Bay, that's how! The man who gave us Pearl Harbour returns to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory once more. This was a sure thing. It was more difficult to fail than it was to succeed and in that sense it was a real achievement.The plot involves a teenage boy who has the fate of the world in his hands thanks to an item he listed on ebay. No, I'm serious. Hilarious set-pieces involve a dog peeing on Ironhide's leg and a prolonged and excruciatingly unfunny conversation about masturbation. If that's not enough humour this Movie offers us not one stereotyped black comic relief character, but THREE! Unbelievabley, one of these racist clichés is a transformer; Jazz the Token-Ghettobot. Just to further the cliché, he is the only one to die. Classic.As the Movie stumbles to a climax, our bland and idiotic heroes take the allspark (that's an energon cube to anyone who knows anything about Transformers) to the middle of a city to ensure maximum loss of life. Why not take it to a field or a desert or an underground bunker you ask? The answer is simple. When was the last time you saw a Pepsi commercial in a desert?So rather than looking forward to the greatest Movie ever, I'm looking back in utter disgust.

The robots faces are great,and some of the action is very nice,but due to no real character,I couldn't give a S@#$t! and soon due to Bays mega-cutting the effects just washed over me and I couldn't wait to leave. I went home and watched John Carpenters 'The Thing' 20 years old..still great cinema...and you know what?..in 20 years time nobody is gonna remember this mess.","Jul 9, 2007",,
"The difference between this movie and Star Wars - why this will be a cult fave with a certain segment of society and not a timeless classic - is the lack of a tightly crafted story to hold the terrific special effects together.There are characters that do not forward the story and disappear part way through the movie. There are new characters that should be introduced in the first three scenes that don't appear until mid way through and therefore don't have the impact they should.Every film maker learns that job one is to make every scene move the story forward, and Michael Bay fails to do this, which results in a 2 hour+ movie that leaves you feeling a vague lack of something instead of a tight 1 hour 50 minute movie that ties up all loose ends and gives every story thread the expected pay off.It's worth seeing if you love great special effects and ""Independence Day"" style alien a$$ kicking, but don't expect the completely satisfied feeling you get from seeing a great story brought to life on screen.","Jul 7, 2007",7,/10

"To most kids growing up in the 80s, the word ""Transformers"" had one very special meaning: fabulous vehicles able to transform into giant robots. And when I say ""most kids"", I don't mean only American kids, as this concept, created by the Japanese toy company Takara, became truly a worldwide phenomenon when in 1984 the American company Hasbro launched the ""Transformers"" toy line with a captivating back-story. What started as a toy line became a full fledged epic tale detailing the adventures of the Autobots, a group of heroic Transformers who protected Earth from an evil faction of their own people who called themselves Decepticons. More than 10 years later, ""Transformers"" remains a popular concept, and proof of that is the fact that filmmaker Michael Bay has directed a live action film about it. Sadly, the result is far from being more than meets the eye.In ""Transformers"", Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a young high school student whose biggest wish is to own a car in order to impress his beautiful classmate Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox). Unfortunately for him, all he can afford is an old rusted Camaro with a tendency to fail at the most inappropriate occasions. One night, he watches his car move by itself, and he follows it to a junkyard, where it transforms into Autobot Bumblebee (Mark Ryan). This won't be the last of his surprises, as after this discovery, he'll be chased by another autonomous vehicle, a police car. Bumblebee manages to save Sam and takes him to his fellow Autobots. Their leader, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), explains Sam that this is only the beginning of a new chapter in their constant war with the Decepticons, but that Sam has the key to something that could end it once and for all.Developed by writers John Rogers, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, the screenplay for ""Transformers"" essentially moves between two main stories: the constant war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, and Sam's coming of age story. In fact, this last theme becomes the most important of the two, as the film focuses a lot on Sam's friendship with his sentient car, Bumblebee, as well as his wish of being Mikaela's boyfriend. Several more subplots are added, some very interesting and some pretty pointless, but unfortunately, the writers do a poor job in tying everything together and the result is a convoluted story that feels awkward in its poor balance of action and comedy. The writer's attempt to develop their character is certainly commendable, as they truly manage to humanize them in a fairly believable way. Sadly, it's not good enough to save the script.As usual with Michael Bay films, his style ""Transformers"" is more eye candy than real storytelling, as he puts a lot more emphasis on fast moving action scenes filled with special effects than in the story the writers delivered for him. Of course, I know it's obvious that the special effects of the giant robots is the movie's main selling point, and they are the reason the movie was made in the first time; however, Bay's trademark quick-cut style of editing together with his shaky camera-work make very hard to fully appreciate the work of the special effects team, as Bay seems to believe that to make a dynamic action film he needs to keep the camera constantly moving without a real reason. If there's something to praise in Bay's directing, that would be his decision of making the Transformers look the most realistic possible, as it adds a lot to the epic nature of the storyline.The acting in the film is pretty much average, with Shia LaBeouf making a very effective performance as Sam, although he is in no way remarkable or outstanding. Mikaela Fox is sadly of the ones who make an awful job, as in this movie she proves that she was only hired because of her looks, not because of any real talent. On the other hand Josh Duhamel is truly one of the highlights of the movie, and one of the few who really adds a lot of power to the film. Hopefully Duhamel will become a rising action star in the future. In a nice detail, Peter Cullen reprises his role as the voice of Optimus Prime, and once again gives his character that the powerful presence it had in the cartoon. Unfortunately, that can't be said of Hugo Weaving, whose great job as Megatron's voice gets lost by an overuse of sound effects in his voice-work.Personally, the biggest problem I have with ""Transformers"" is not that it's bad (it is not), it is that it could had been a lot better given the elements Bay had to work with. I'm not saying the script is a masterpiece, as it seriously lacks focus and fails at mixing comedy and action, but the approach director Michael Bay used in the film only made it feel even more mediocre than what it is. While the movie has a wonderful visual look (no doubt thanks to Bay's experience making commercials), his frantic editing and sloppy narrative diminish the quality of Mitchell Amundsen's cinematography and the special effects team's masterful work. I won't deny that there are instances where his style works perfectly, and that the movie gets really entertaining in more than one occasion, but I couldn't help but feeling that I was watching a long commercial instead of the epic battle of robots that the advertising promised.""Transformers"" is one of those movies that provide instant entertainment and give the impression of being pretty cool, but end up feeling shallow when one begins to seriously think about them. That's probably the best advice to enjoy ""Transformers"": not to think too seriously about it, as ultimately it is as shallow as a TV commercial. It's a fun movie with great special effects and some good performances, but it's not the great action movie that it could had been. 6/10","Sep 12, 2007",6,/10
"I saw this in Orange on a digital screen on one of the early screenings and kept going back.OK I'm 27 and long ago boxed up my transformers from childhood. But I had to see this movie. If you're like me, you remember Optimus Prime, the hero of heroes. Since Star Wars has come and gone, there are few articles of childhood left to see again on the big screen. Transformers is one of those toy marketing schemes that actually made interesting characters, and of course, sold a lot of toys.I am highly skeptical of Michael Bay. Not only does he make crappy movies, but he has to destroy a nice car in the middle of it all. But here, I give the guy a pass.I like to see my home state on the silver screen too. They filmed the ""Qatar"" scenes in Alamogordo, New Mexico. So about this movie...I was entranced from beginning to end. The dialog was sometimes a little to rapid fire and nervous, poor megan fox had almost nothing to do, some characters were out of place and plotting weird, but in the end, the film is a winner.The effects really do sell the film in every scene. Bumble Bee, Optimus, all of them are extremely well ""acted"" by the talented computer animators. There needs to be some kind of acting award besides special effects for this thing.Yeah, megatron comes up out of nowhere. Lots of the plot make little sense, but hey I sat down and watched some old episodes on Youtube and found that i couldn't even follow what the hell was going on in the cartoon. I would say in the movie, they made an improvement with plotting.The Decepticons are effectively menacing, especially when Barricade confronts Sam on the hood of a car. That one was actually pretty startling. I've had nightmares as a kid being chased by giant killer robots and yeah, this one got a little close. Enough of my freudian fears.This movie delivered, it was superbly entertaining and very very well done. I don't quite acquit Michael bay for Pearl Harbor or destroying the Ferrari 355 in The ROCK, but here, he gets a pass. Can't wait for the multi disc DVD. Bring on the sequels.","Jul 29, 2007",8,/10
Like many people I grew up with the G1 Transformers and went in knowing that this movie was going to be different than the cartoon that I knew and loved as a kid. I wanted this movie to stand as original yet keep the elements that made the cartoon so special. Getting to know the personalities of each robot was what made the cartoon so endearing. Humans were the supporting cast. I know that it was a tall task to personalize each robot within 2 1/2 hours yet I believe that it could have been accomplished if the focus of the film were truly through a Transformer's perspective and not through Sam Witwicky's eyes. The time that was spent showing off Megan Fox's body (and all of the sexually driven teen-age humor) could have been used to build affection for the fun-loving Jazz (who was my favorite character back in the 80's.) I should have been able to feel some emotion from his death yet I was never given a chance to know who he was... very anti-climactic.All-in-all the movie allowed me to feel what it would be like if Transformers were in our world today. It did make for a solid July 4th weekend summer blockbuster. I did enjoy the brief glimpse into the personalities of the Autobots (especially Iron Hide) yet left the theater feeling that I wanted to learn more about them individually. Disappointment in the movie compelled me to throw in a couple episodes from my season 2 DVD collection of the Transformers it actually helped. Maybe the makers of the next movie will get it right (I'm still hoping to see the classic match-up between the Dinobots and Devastator!) Too much human and not enough robot perspective... which is supposed to be what the Transformers are all about... at least based on what I remember.Overall Grade: C+ Story: C Acting: C- Direction: C Visuals: A,"Jul 5, 2007",7,/10

There was non-stop action from beginning to end. it had it's awkward moments, if you had kids with you you know what I mean, but they were still funny. I also liked the fact that you could have walked into the theater knowing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about Transformers and still understand the movie, the storyline, and the Transformers themselves. On the downside though...wait...there wasn't one. IF there was though, there's enough robot action and car/robot chase scenes to make that all better. when I first saw it, 7/2/07 I was like...'wow' this movie set the bar WAY up there for movies to come.

"Transformers is about a group of robots with the ability to transform into automobiles and various other mechanical things, who come to earth to find the Allspark, the source of power and creation on their world, which was long since decimated by war. This is a wet dream for anyone of my generation, as the cartoon and toys were what I grew up with. But for me (as I was pretty much strictly a Looney Tunes viewer) Transformers was always on the fringe of what I knew. That does not mean that this movie is any less fun. When they make a movie like this, it seems like there are really only two directions to go: ham it up, or take the ""Batman"" route and make it as serious as possible. This one did choose to ham it up and I don't think it was the wrong decision. It is still a very action packed sci-fi fan's movie. Transformers is great propaganda for joining the army, much like the TV show ""24"" makes being a counter terrorist agent seem cool. I enjoyed it anyway. It is super violent, but most of that violence is robot-on-robot in a hyper blown cartoon-ish sort of way. I was definitely struck by how it made being in the military look so cool, with all of its weapons and toys and definitely a lot of respect shown to all of its men and women. One complaint: it is a little hard to see what's going on in some of the action sequences. It is very fast and all CGI. The sound is booming and very effective, but the actual visuals don't always cut it. The plot (as if anyone cares) does the job of bringing the Transformers into this century, with our present world conflicts, and for the most part it works. Any general cheesiness in the dialogue or situations, for me, was easily forgiven by the fact that, well, it's from an '80s cartoon and toy. Good movie!","Jul 7, 2007",7,/10

"I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of what seems to be the biggest summer blockbuster, Transformers. After seeing the trailer, I became more excited than ever to see this movie. I expected to see a lot of action and some slight humor. I had very high expectations for this movie. And it surpassed all of them.Though in a competition with some of the biggest summer blockbusters in history, most of which were sequels. Transformers held it's own and exceeded expectations. Which is impressive in itself, seeing that Transformers is held to such high standards. It was not a short movie, by any standards. Two and a half hours is more than some can take in a theater. But, I personally don't have a problem with a long movie, as long as I am entertained. And I was.Half way through the movie, I was curious to see if the movie could sustain its steam. And didn't know if any more excitement, and laughter could come from this movie. But, I was very pleasantly surprised to find, that it didn't lose it's steam. Transformers was incredibly entertaining throughout the entire two and a half hours.I expected very large action scenes and incredible effects, and it transcended all expectations. The new effects, were outstanding. And made the action scenes so much more exciting and captivating. But, what surprised me was the incredible humor that this movie contained. I expected to laugh, and I expected the funny ""one liners"", but I did not expect to laugh so often and with such intensity. Transformers was hysterical, I loved every minute of it. Even more surprising than the incredible humor, was the heart behind the movie. You begin to care for the ""Autobots"" and can't wait till the ""Decepticons"" get what is coming to them.This movie was also very well acted. Adding another notch under his belt Shia LaBouf made a charismatic, funny, lovable Sam Witwicky. While the always charming Josh Duhamel added a great performance as Captain Lennox. Both men were a good add of ""eye candy"" for the ladies to enjoy. But the men have plenty to look at as well, with the gorgeous Megan fox as Mikaela Banes, the girl of Sam's obsession. And Australian bombshell Rachael Taylor as Maggie Madsen.All in all, this movie exceeded all of my expectations. The action scenes were even more than I expected. The humor, was funnier than anticipated. And the movie in all was exceptional, and worth the money to go see it. And I am a person who can't wait for the DVD, so that I can take Transformers home with me.","Jul 7, 2007",,
The negative reviews for this movie are justified. Cool plot I guess. Incredible CGI. Megan Fox. That's about it.First this may be a persona preference but I did not like how the transformers didn't have any resemblance to the vehicles they were. They all looked like completely different beings. Also the transformations were extreme closeup where you couldn't see anything. The action scenes were way to quick dark and fast. Stuff just kept happening and happening.Also I just didn't care much about the transformers. They had no personality outside of bumble bee. Megatron was barely in it and did nothing. Prime had a bigger part but still I didn't care.I wanted more about their home planet. I know why they were on earth but give us some more history.I wanted more story and less fighting.,"Aug 1, 2022",6,/10

If you grew up in the time of transformers you will be familiar with the voices and all. Don't listen to the guy who just wants to try and bring people down. Should be less negative. Sure there are some spots where you kind of go.. uhh OK.. But in the end it is a rather enjoyable film. I'm sure this chester fellow will talk down about many other movies and try to make people lose interest. If your interested in it.. watch it.It's an awesome movie.Take from it what you want.

This definitely kills the buzz. It's driving me CRAZY and I'm really sure it's driving the composers crazy too! Even ""Saint Hans"" himself, has had to recreate the piece.

"I must confess I did not feel much smarter leaving the cinema yesterday evening, but despite this, the rush the movie gave by pure action and spectacle was more than enough to keep me not just interested, but excited about the movie for it's 144 minutes, craving more at the end.Script wise, the movies may not be worthy of a Nobel price, but succeeds greatly in transforming the original material from the series into a working movie. Clichés are however to many for a European audience to handle very well. The movie also spots loads of great humor, something which magically blends with what is probably the main feature of the movies: it's spectacular to watch.In terms of special effects, Transformers is beyond state-of-the-art. It literally shines, and the action sequences are incredibly well pulled off. The Autobots also look amazing, despite some weird changes in their size from time to time. Also, the sounds works very well, and nowhere better than in the voice of Optimus Prime, which for some reason gives the robot a character unlike any computer-created actor I've ever seen seen.The movie is quite simply a great experience. It mixes humor with amazing visuals, giving you a rush that screams for a sequel.If they manage to make the inevitable sequel carry the same level of action, but spiced with more depth in the story, this could be the beginning of something truly great.","Jul 6, 2007",8,/10

"If we define 'totalitarian regimes' as those which exercise propagandistic control over the values and interests of the ruled, then by this definition most Americans are living under a totalitarian regime. The 2007 film Transformers does not fall short of a militaristic call-to-arms. The conjuring up of post-911 imagery and the clearly modernist plot-purity of good vs. evil aligns this film with the goals of American military generals and Republican politicians. I watched the film in the Netherlands, and it seemed everyone in the audience noticed the film was radiating American military fantasies from the screen into the cineplex. The exhilaration of obscenity, the obscenity of obviousness, the obviousness of power, the power of simulation. It even included a clear recruitment message (which seemed ironic while watching it in a foreign country)--near the end the glorified American soldier, Josh Duhamel, turns to the main character, a sloppy teenager played by Shia LaBeouf, and says, ""You're a soldier now...."" A sappy orchestral chord fills the theater, as we apparently are to feel included in the act of 'becoming a US soldier' and compelled to join the Army Rangers to help the Autobots destroy the Decepticons in a galactic showdown with American accomplishment at the centerpiece.America is the only country which gives you the opportunity to be so brutally naive about films like this. In fact, some of us know films like these are simply part of the militaristic education in America: of learning obedience to our patriarchal authorities, of developing a taste for military 'action', and the constant reassertion and justification of the American military mission on the geopolitical scene. But back in the States, no other American seems to notice the film's pungent ideological consequences. The users on IMDb who dislike the film can only point to plot flaws or technical mistakes, or a general distaste for CGI graphics. Others point out that it simply wasn't violent enough. When our culture is as inundated as it is, there really is no desire to adopt a critical stance on films that represent our own ideology. And in fact most don't notice. It may be that the truth of America can only be seen from outside the fishbowl, since only there will you discover the perfect immanence and simulation of these values. Americans, for our part, have no sense of simulation. We are simulation in its most immanent state, and have no language to describe it, since we are an isolated model that communicates mostly with itself.As a result, just as Optimus Prime observed that humans were violent creatures, Americans are also the ideal material for an analysis of culturally-encouraged violence against other cultures. No more and no less than primitive societies were analyzed in their day. The same mythical and analytical excitement that made us look toward those societies today impels outsiders to look in the direction of America. With the same interest and the same prejudices.","Aug 25, 2007",1,/10

"Michael Bay isn't exactly notable for Oscar-worthy plot/character driven films, but he sure does know how to make one hell of a fun and aesthetically pleasing movie. Bay has taken the immensely popular Transformers franchise which had previously only been seen in the light of comic-books, toys, and cartoons and has brought it into the realm of the real world with this movie.The storyline is very straightforward in its structure as the quintessential, thematic Good vs. Evil piece: Two polar opposite factions of a robotic alien race (The Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron) duke it out on our lovely green planet in order to retrieve a cube that holds the power of the universe so that they can destroy it to keep the evil-doers from abusing its powers or use it with evil intent. Stuck in the middle are the two humans, Sam and Mikaela, who become entangled with these (incredibly cool) alien beings. The story goes on from thereon out detailing how the Autobots and Decepticons try to find the cube along with the help of Sam and Mikaela.Now honestly, coming into this movie, you really can't expect it to be American History X or Schindler's List dramatically uncovering deep flaws or triumphs in humanity, but what you should expect is loads and loads of fun, which you will surely receive. From the get-go we get an incredible action scene that has a helicopter transformer wreaking complete havoc on a military base somewhere in the Middle East. Simply put, it's amazing. However, being a Transformers fan as a child, the most thrilling scene was when they introduced Optimus Prime and the other Autobots, which is pretty self-explanatory.The movie is unbelievably captivating--it's stunning visually and the CGI/special effects are flawless. Every single action scene had the audience cheering for more and more of the jaw-dropping effects and ""wow"" moments in the theater I was in.Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox do well in portraying their characters, despite some moments of awkward adolescence. There were some questionable plot holes in the movie, such as some times when certain characters were left in a cliffhanger of a scene and then never heard of again. However, that's totally okay because I don't think anyone actually cared or paid attention to those characters as they only became roadblocks to the next awesome action sequence. Also be forewarned, there is a whole lot of product placement in this movie. Every few minutes you'll be sure to find some kind of product that companies have sneakily endorsed into the movie.9/10 because it achieves what it is meant to be and never tries to be anything else. It is consistent in its structure not to mention (yet again) completely awesome and action-packed despite some problematic storyline details. So be sure to catch this movie, because it's probably going to be the most fun you'll have in the theaters this summer.","Jul 3, 2007",,
"I have to say that this movie really started off strong and I thought that it kept up the intensity the whole way. This is really and 8 out of 10 for me but it had to lose at least one point for a big drawback in my opinion. Optimus Prime does NOT have a mouth. He has a shield over his mouth. Every poster showed him the right way, but them come movie time he has an exposed mouth and the shield only covers it when he is fighting. Are you kidding me, this may be really minor to some people but Optimus is my favorite character and he has been since I was a kid (mainly because of his look). It's like Michael Bay said ""I believe that people can suspend reality enough to believe that cars and equipment can turn into robots, but it's a little far fetched to believe that one could talk without a mouth"". UGH. He doesn't have a mouth plain and simple and for whatever reason that obviously has really gotten on my nerves. Other than that it had great Transformer action, which is all I was looking for. So at least something was done right.","Jul 6, 2007",7,/10

"It is easy to think that any movie that comes from either comic book or cartoon never seems to hit its mark. THis i am happy to say is one of the exceptions.With some of the greatest CG seen since Lord of the Rings there is little fault with the monstrous machines.The casting was almost flawless and the script itself impeccable save for some irrelevant and tiring jokes.The score of the movie is perfect even though at some times corny through Jazz's comical urgings toward Shia Labeouf's character.Although i was constantly kicked in the back in the cinema by two young children and they drowned out important dialog with there constant ""that's Optimus"" or ""Oh no Megatron"" nothing could bring down the spectacle that is Transformers. Whether you grew up with the original or simply fell into the toys and movie i feel safe to say it will stay in the hearts of all audience's.","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10

"It has been only a mere 3 to 4 weeks since I saw Transformers, and, gott in himmel, I will not say anything that someone else have already said. But, man, it really was an awful, terrible movie!!! Why would people like to consume that kind of junk? And I'm a BIG Transformers fan!! I mean, I watched all the episodes back when I was a kid. Not so long ago, I bought a ""special edition"" with the first 4 episodes. And still can't believe how bad the movie adaptation was! Does somebody want's a proof? See ""Armaggedon""!!! See ""The Island""!!! I just saw that one a few days ago, and maaaaaaan, was that a huge mistake!!!!??? You could say that this kind of movies exist with the only purpose of making even more valuables the good movies: you know, the ones with a good story, a coherent script, the ones which don't have as a main purpose to show the tits of the girl o' the moment (though the movie is about some robots and their war?). There is something happening in Hollywood: it's in crisis. Thus, the writers' guild strike. Just imagine, they might be over stressed with work, maybe they are writing like 254 scripts for 254 movies, all due January,2008!!! Bah, some gibberish!! ""Transformers"" sucked!!! Michael Bay sucks!!","Nov 8, 2007",1,/10
"Transformers the movie was awesome it's the best action movie of the year great actors,special features and everything it is worth buying a ticket for.If you like jumping out of your seat with excitement this is the movie for you lots of excitement and comedy. This is my new favorite movie the theme of the movie is great you know it had to take a long time but it was worth it. Transformers is going to be put up for so many awards and has already won an award before it hit theaters. For best movie we haven't seen yet by the MTV movie awards. If there's a movie that has been nominated for an award and won even before it hits theaters then that is the type of movie i would like to see. There are a lot of action movie's out there like ghost rider,die hard,fantastic four,spider man etc. but transformers wins them over hands down. Transformers like any action movie has it's villain hero problem solution etc, but is taken to a whole new different level of action this movie is compared to a roller coaster it has up's adventurous parts and down's slow but good parts of the movie so go see the best movie of the year(DON'T WAIT GO SEE THE DARN MOVIE).","Jul 5, 2007",10,/10
"First of all, let me say that all in all: I liked this movie. However, I was hoping it would link in a bit better with the original: The characters were updated for this movie - that is OK, and expected. But some were SO updated, you could not quite recognize them from the original TV show. Especially the Decepticons were a bit difficult to keep apart, as they were quite similar when transformed into robots.The voices were not kept close enough to the original. Megatron and Starscream had very distinctive voices in the TV series, but they were completely different in the movie. Kudos for keeping Optimus Primes voice like the original.Optimus Prime was wise and tactful in the TV series, but in the movie he at times are quite clumsy - for instance in the scene in Sams back garden. I found that rather disrespectful...Finally I was waiting the whole movie for Megatron to transform into the mighty gun - but he never did! All in all - this was always going to be a movie for the old Transformers fans of the 80-ies. It was never going to be realistic, so why strive to make it more realistic than the original? I wanted to see old Transformers revived. I did not want to see what the Transformers would look like if they were invented today...Still a good movie, though...","Jul 5, 2007",6,/10
"After seeing the reviews here and the surprisingly big rating, I decided to go and watch this movie. No big expectations though. I saw it 'da capo a fine', just to make sure I'm not missing anything.This must be by far the worse movie I've seen in the past years.This is not the ""it's so bad, that it's good"" kind of movie. This is limitless garbage. The plot is hilarious, with no regards to logic or reality whatsoever, the characters are VERY unconvincing, behind an acting which is absolutely horrible. I would like to point out the tremendously unrealistic ""British accent"" of Rachael Taylor (Maggie Madsen), a sort of mix between talentless acting and parody.The stench of rotten ""politically correctness"", distributed homogeneously in dialogues, casting and plot, is only equaled by the cheesy humour that can perhaps extract a blank smile from participants at the Special Olympics.The special effects are good, the only good part of the movie, but they also tend to become boring, in a flat and predictable way, just after the first few minutes, too feeble to sustain as a compensation the terrible ugliness of everything else.The movie is not a complete waste of time though. It must be seen, as proof that in the 21st century you can still make a bad movie with a huge budget.","Aug 18, 2007",1,/10
"Ah yes, military bases - no tax on goods, cheap gas, and a sneak preview of Transformers. Michael Bay did one hell of a bang up job on this one.I went into the movie expecting a cool, product-placement movie, but what I got in return was a ridiculous but awesome film. From the get go, the movie is fast paced and the action starts quick. Then it slows down into a story building motion, but speeds up again after the introduction of all of the characters. Basically, the movie can be split into two parts: the ridiculous, comedic portion and the action oriented, blow your mind portion.As for the graphics, simply put they are orgasmically good. The transformations from car to bot, and vice versa, are smooth and flowing even in the middle of action. They mesh well with the environments and actually appear to be real without that CGI-texture look.Nerd or moviegoer alike, the movie is great and I would have spent my hard-earned money it if I didn't have the option of seeing this free screening. However, for the supernerds out there, there are a few inconsistencies in the movie but only they would let that ruin the experience. Easily and most likely the top movie of the summer so far.","Jul 1, 2007",10,/10
"There is a mystery to cinema because it is an illusive art. It is an artistic collaboration and for that reason it resembles a labyrinth with no center. In viewing a film it's nearly impossible to pin down where a given creative touch is coming from and the result is that the aesthetic heat of a film is generated as from a house fire instead of a single match. This analogy holds true that a good script is doused in gasoline and a talented director is like a propane tank in the basement, such that a burning house can take on the impulse of dynamite. And in the absence of explosive potential a movie can simply burn up resources and create a mild spectacle. With this comparison in hand, a Michael Bay movie is like taking 150 million dollars worth resources, assembling them in a huge special effects pile and lighting it ablaze, then stand back and watch it for a couple hours. Yes it is mildly entertaining, and lots of people who happen past will also stand and watch the massive fire, you could even charge admission. But is it art? Well I guess that depends on what you call art. I enjoy watching building demolition. To see a large formidable structure give way by the force of a controlled explosion and crumble into dust and rubble entertains me. I know that these demolitions require a high degree of technical prowess. The buildings structure is taken into account, charges are set with explosives which is not a simple task, and controls are enforced to insure things go smoothly. The result is something that I find entertaining to watch. Do I consider it art? Well sure, why the hell not? It involves degrees of ingenuity and creativity, but it's safe to say that there is no Matisse of building demolition. This is because building demolition is limited by its practical application, which is to take down a building rather than express a higher degree of cultural relevance within the practice of demolition. In the same way a Michael Bay movie is limited by the practical application to make as much money as possible. Can't really hold that against him, but at the same time there is no need to give him more credit than what's due. So to say that Transformers is anything more than an explosive semi nostalgic money grab is similar to saying cotton candy tastes great and won't rot you teeth. That kind of talk gives you cavities.","Dec 26, 2007",,

"This movie will probably be the focal point of the summer. This movie had tons of action and a great storyline. It has made so much world-wide that it cannot be beaten. Shia LaBeouf is such a great actor, he sells the movies with his eyes. In some parts I thought the robots were actually there, his emotions were spot on, and he didn't over act. I thought Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson were going to suck, but I was blown away by the acting they showed. I was surprised to hear that this was Megan Fox's first big movie because she seemed like a pro. This movie really appealed to the original audience, and the younger kids. I am keeping my fingers crossed for Transformer II, and if there is going to be one Shia better be in it! I give the movie a 10/10! ***MUST SEE!***","Jul 11, 2007",10,/10
"First of all let me just say that I am not one of those crazy Transformers fan boys like the Elias character from Kevin Smiths Clerks 2 movie. I am familiar with the Transformers back from my Saturday morning cartoon phase when I was just a lad, but thats about as far as my previous knowledge of them goes. I arrived at this movie expecting a typical Michael Bay summer blockbuster effects driven adventure. I knew it wasn't going to be Oscar worthy material, keeping that in mind, I found myself being rather entertained, and not totally disappointed.While the movie does hold a typical big budget summer flick running time, there is usually enough going on to hold your attention. Shi Labeouf carries his role well as one of the main human characters, I found myself enjoying everything he did more and more as the film went on. His co-star Megan Fox, while very very easy on the eyes, did not totally come across as well for most of the film. Near the beginning when you first meet her she seemed to me very wooden and stiff, but later farther into the film she seemed to get better and more into the role. The real stars of the film however are the Transformers themselves. The autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and the Decepticons led by Megatron duke it out and flex their metal muscle throughout the film. I also thought the cars were cool to, if not really excessive with the product placement. I think that with the exception of the classic camero, all the other cars they transformed into always had the logo front and center aimed at the camera.All and all I suppose that there are worse ways to spend two hours of your life. I think some of Michael Bays more adult rated R movies like Bad Boys 2 are better but I did not leave the theater to disappointed. Take it for what it is folks, a big budget summer popcorn flick, it has some bad, groan inducing moments, but it also had some wow that was cool, and hey that was pretty funny moments to! Don't be to critical and just try to have fun, maybe play a game, like count the number of product placements or something!","Jul 2, 2007",7,/10
"The movie opened at the Local theater on Monday, I went to the 8pm showing with a friend. Bothof us are huge fans of the cartoon series. Never the less we where both expecting TRANSFORMERS to be just like the other movies of recent that remade classic 80's TV shows. After the very first action scene in the movie, when the movie paused on a black screen all my friend and I could say was WOW! This is coming from the two people who you never want to watch a movie with because we are terrible critics and rip movies apart while we watch them. TRANSFORMERS was so good that even though it has only been out 3 days I have already seen it twice, and I hate spending the money for movie theater ticket prices.

But what's going on with the votes? 8.1 with more than 30.000 votes... I guess that it will become one of the entries for the top 250 movies of all time, and that,I don't seem to understand. It's really a good action film and it's an almost perfect adaptation of the Transformers world, It even has all the elements that make Michael Bay a good action director, I love that really cool effects of him slowing down the action for boosting up emotion. But c'mon people it's not really in the same league as Ben-Hur, or even Star Wars The Return of the Jedi. Please don't take my opinion in a bad way, the movie is really cool and it deserves to get praise, especially Shia Lebouef and Michael Bay, BUT I think that a little of the amazing credibility that IMDb had, was lost in the latest months by over-estimating judgements with a lot of the latest movies.","Jul 9, 2007",7,/10

I would rather watch every episode of the original cartoon series than have to sit through this mindless piece of garbage again.

You won't even notice that you have been sitting that long. Children and adults will love this movie.

"You have to admit there is some truth in the title of my review. TRANSFORMERS was definitely one of the films I looked forward to seeing during the summer. The trailers looked awesome, and I couldn't wait to see the movie. I walked out with mixed feelings, although the feeling of disappointment outweighed my more positive feelings. But time has passed, and I'm slowly appreciating the movie a bit more.The first fifteen minutes are very promising, providing humor and great character development. Shia LaBeouf is in the lead role, and he is fantastic! His character has a great, lovable personality you just can't resist. The scene where he buys the car, however, left me with a strange feeling because it was so fast-paced and different.Next, we're trekking through the desert with a unit of soldiers when they are greeted by a transformer. These action sequences are spectacular. However, they serve almost no relevance to the overall plot of the movie, which by the way, is a very interesting plot.While being your average ""unqualified person must stop beasts from taking over universe and get girl"" plot, it has its own unique way of presenting itself, providing great action sequences and awesome special effects. While the plot is obviously unrealistic (because it's a sci-fi film), it comes with some unrealistic moments, such as a 5 foot Transformer making its way through a sea of people without getting noticed.This is one of several problems with the film: not being realistic. People's reactions to the Transformers are not the way a normal human would react. The humor is just plain awful (Sam's Happy Time was just outright nasty), and the movie seems to take itself seriously during some scenes and then strips away its dignity in others. These problems are what make the movie strange and sometimes hard to watch.This goes for about an hour, right up until Sector Seven enters. The rest of the movie after the introduction of S7 is fine. Most of it is action, and of course the action is some of the most entertaining in movie history.One other problem I could actually feel was the film trying to be dramatic. Car chase scenes were spoiled for me because of random guitar riffs beginning to crunch, slow motion effects were painful to watch, and Optimus Prime talked as if he just came from the recent Star Wars films. However, his voice was done to perfection.I would also like to tip my hat to the others who did the voices of the Transformers; although some of the lines were painful to hear simply because of how strange they were (""this looks like a good place to kick it!""), all the voices were magnificent.Transformers had the potential to be a great film, but it only turned out OK. Right now it's at an 8.2, but that will probably drop as more people view it. There is some truth about the title of my review; whenever it doesn't take itself seriously it feels like Power Rangers. That's the main problem; the film doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be serious or not, and that makes it a bit difficult to watch, because you want to take it seriously, but you just can't at certain moments. Overall, I give this movie a 5.5- an OK film with some positive notes and some negative ones.","Jul 9, 2007",5,/10
"So what's wrong with Transformers?... An easier question is what isn't wrong with Transformers. Let's see Shia Labeouf's performance is wonderfully appealing and he's starting to look more attractive. Megan Fox is pretty to look at. And the spfx are good the first time they happen. That's about it. Now what's wrong with it. I'm not a fan of the cartoon nor have I watched therefore I can not speak for that group of people. No story. Loud. Obnoxious. Dumb. Directionless. Boring. Bad Acting. Bad cinematography. Bad casting. Actually reduces your brain capacity after watching. Very little entertainment value. Painfully repetitive. Yep well that's about it. Transformers certainly isn't the worst film I've seen but it's definitely one of the worst. It's dreadfully loud and obnoxious. I left with a horrible headache and found the movie to be painfully stupid. I didn't really understand what was going on and really couldn't see anything because of the chaotic Blair Witch style cinematography. Except for those now ridiculous Michael Bay slow motion shots and pan outs. This is quite possibly the dorkiest film ever made and you have any bit of coolness to you, you'll run for the exits.

"Michael Bay. When you hear the name, the words ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" pop in your mind. Sure he has a bad reputation, but who could blame him? When he works, he's having fun, just like any other person would. So when he was announced that he was going to direct a live-action version of Transformers, the toy robot-cum-animated series, there was a serious debating issue over the internet.The critics couldn't be more wrong.Transformers is a huge crowd-pleaser. Undoubtedly Bay's best film to date. But this is due to his partnership with executive producer God... I mean Steven Spielberg, and manage to control a budget that is big but not as inflated as certain web-slingers and pirates we know. The special effects are amazing, the acting is good, the action scenes are spectacular, and plot holes are as abundant as craters on the Moon. Yet, this film turns out to satisfy almost everyone going in the theater: having a sh*tload of fun!!! When Sam Witwicky buys a new, or rather, old car, little does he know that he and everyone around him will be whisked away to a grand and epic adventure beyond anything imaginable. LaBeouf's acting in here is good, as he manages to show his funny side and heroic side. A I grew up with his show on Disney Channel, Even Stevens, from this film, I could tell Shia was on his way to the top. Among all the Disney Channel Graduates, he is the most successful of them all, and he will continue to be that way. After Indiana Jones IV, the name ""Shia LaBeouf"" will mean box-office gold.Supporting actors are good too. Megan Fox was cute as the hero's lover. Tyrese and Josh Duhamel were great as G.I. soldiers caught up in another war. It was nice to see Jon Voight taking a role that suits him UNLIKE Baby Geniuses 2. The only thing that bugged me a little was Rachael Taylor and Anthony Anderson's characters. I feel that their character's existence does not explain much of the plot.I was really please that the producers got original G1 voice actor Peter Cullen as the Autobots leader Optimus Prime. That was probably the best thing about the casting. Hugo Weaving was a good replacement for Frank Welker for the villain, Megatron. Thee Autobots are good, the Decepticons are evil. That's all you need to know.Overall, I believe Michael Bay has given us a true ""Summer Blockbuster"", one that will be remembered for a long time. It is supremely loyal to the original series, and then some. I recommend it with a big box of popcorn.8.15/10 Delton","Oct 13, 2007",6,/10

In the same time another car like that (more beautiful) is there and the old car is changing in that car. What about that. Another thing that i don t liked was when they decided to take the cube into the city. Bad idea.

I don't have kids, but if I did, I would never let them watch this. The film portrays everything militaristic in a disturbingly fetishistic light. American militaristic Propaganda. But its not done in a tongue in cheek way like the underrated and generally misunderstood Starship Troopers. Michael Bay is not nearly as smart Paul Verhoeven and no where near as talented.

"this is the best action movie of the year and in fact the best I've ever seen .so much action from start to finish and its funny too. its so entertaining and a sure fire hit! when the robots start fighting after a lot you think its over, but no they were just getting started for the ultimate grand finale. the robots crash through buildings and a lot of other stuff, and destroy pretty much all of New York. the girl that Shia Labeouf likes is so sexy, she too fine to be in school. If you like transformers or not you'll love this movie. If you a kid,adult,boy or girl it appeals to absolutely everyone. This film will have you talking and have felt like you went on a fast ride.","Aug 2, 2007",10,/10
"Transformers is thin on plot and coherence, but it's still a blast.The action sequences are absolutely breathtaking at times, even though the camera is so close you often can't tell what's happening. It doesn't matter though because the digital effects are so incredible and the action is so intensely done with lots of speed, explosions and great sound effects. Seeing this in the theater with full sound can give you shivers down your spine.The first part of the movie features the more logical part of the plot, even if it's just a typical and dry high school kid storyline. That's really what keeps it in the realm of logic. The dialogue isn't as bad here and everything makes more sense. It's when the robots show up that everything falls apart.The auto bots are more or less just there for the kids, which isn't a bad thing on its own. Unfortunately, they have some terrible dialogue and their characters are more clumsy and dimwitted than heroic. It's obvious that they're more just there to be cute and entertaining than actually be real characters. They don't really offer anything compelling, instead they're basically just stand ins there to blow up stuff and provide some slapstick relief. The decepticons aren't much better.The plot is equally kiddish. It revolves around this ancient artifact that all the robots are after. Fair enough, but it gets so silly you'll be shaking your head at it.It's still fun though. In all of its simplicity and childishness, you can be entertained. The characters are also likable enough (albeit pretty flat) so that you can care about them, especially Shia Lebouf. He does a great job providing an easily likable main character, and he does a good job with all the comedic bits.It's a fun movie despite how ridiculous and nonsensical it can get. The action will blow you away and you'll like the transformers, even if they are just marketing tools for the kids. Don't expect anything crafty or complex, just sit back and enjoy the fun.","May 19, 2008",7,/10
"A couple of weeks ago I was bragging about how great Transformers was going to be, but I was wrong. The movie was just a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger action movie. No offense to Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg but the movie was a not well put together movie. The acting was horrible, some of the characters were annoying, the action was sometimes impossible to see because of how much stuff was going on the shot and the sound effects were extremely and unnecessarily loud. Also the whole movie was basically a comedy that really wasn't funny. The only thing I can't complain about was that at least I understood the story, even though there were some holes and incomplete character plots. Another thing that bugs me is why did the military decide to go to LA to have the robots fight where there are millions of people. Maybe you can figure it out.Even though I read the reviews about Transformers being a bad acting movie, I went to go watch the movie just to see the action scenes, I knew that the movie was not going to be any good. I am surprised that Steven Spielberg would help produce a movie like this. And in my opinion the only two good movies that Michael Bay has directed has been The Rock and The Island. As for Shia LaBeouf this isn't his best movie. Also John Turturro and Jon Voight sadly did not give a good performance in the movie.The three reasons why I am giving the movie three stars is because first Megan Fox is really hot, second the visual effects were amazing, and third even though the action scenes were a mess I still found it to be amazing on how they finalized the visual effects all together. This movie just shows how teenagers like me, go to the movies to watch movie junk like Transformers and don't experience what good film-making is. If you plan to go see Transformers I don't blame you, I went to go see it too. But, in my opinion you should save your money and go see a better movie like Ratatouille, but make sure you go in the morning so that you don't have lowlife parents bringing their screaming one month old babies to the theater. I am ashame on how crappy Hollywood is becoming with their movies. As a person who looks forward into studying film-making this movie is not a good example of how the film-making business is influential.","Jul 3, 2007",3,/10
"Transformers Finally a non-sequel!!! It's not that this year's sequels weren't good, but you have to admit that the vast number of franchises was getting stale. In comes Transformers with as much hype to fill in the entire world's theatres, and whilst this film is not for girls, it is one hell of a ride for fans of the original animated series and even to those who didn't know who the hell Meagatron was!In Qatar the American military forces, are attacked by a mysterious and unknown force, which leaves many dead with the sole exceptions of Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and his team. Meanwhile, back in the ""normal"" world, luckless Sam gets his first car, which incidentally turns out to be an autobot with the name Bumblebee. Eager to impress high-school hottie Mikela, Sam offers her a ride, but when things start to go wrong and Sam is attacked by one of the Deceptions, Sam and Mikela must put aside their prejudices and work alongside the Autobots led by the legendary Optimus Prime in an epic battle against the Deceptions under the commands of the menacing Megatron.I wasn't expecting any superb acting turns from this movie, but I was surprised to find that the film sported many good performances. Shia LeBeouf is an excellent choice for the role of Sam WitWicky, giving a performance bustling with charisma and crackling with energy. He has been rightly tagged as Hollywood's next big thing! Megan Fox is a newcomer, but even though when she was on screen, her acting skills were the last thing I was thinking about. Still, her character is ruddy brilliant, and Michael Bay gad already used this technique with Scalett Johannsen on The Island. Josh Duhamel isn't bad either, even though his problems and inner conflict are hardly hinted at. Jon Voigt's character is unnecessary and is in my opinion miscast as his role should have gone to a younger, more menacing actor. But overall, this is a very good haul, with the young leads obviously standing out.The screenplay is decent, and the dialogue is classic Michael Bay. What bothers me is that when important topics are raised these are drained by an explosion or any other form of noisy distraction. Pity though! Also the film is unbelievably humorous, and whilst most of its humour is dark, the jokes centre on awkwardness and embarrassment instead of the usual slapstick humour. The film also goes around the usual boy meets girl fun, and this played quite well, with LeBeouf easily making us sympathize with him.The special effects are unprecedented, and this is because it is much more difficult to use special effects with robots which are huge and made up of a good many things, than with let's say Spiderman. The effects are put to good use, but they never take complete control. Megatron is obviously the film's tour-de-force and the Autobots are similarly good, even though the voice acting could've been far better. Still, their ridiculousness had me roaring with laughter! The final battle is epic, but it's a little to.busyto truly stand out. Mini battles happen within the big battle which causes confusion.Verdict If treated as a comedy, this film will go down in film history books, as an action movie, it is the mother of all, but as the best film of the year, it needs more drama to go down with the brilliant humour and action.","Aug 3, 2007",9,/10

"I'll admit that i as a child i never really watched transformers and being 21, it was on in the prime of my childhood. What this movie did was make me feel that something was missing from my childhood, that i regretted never watching it as a kid. The movie had everything, top acting, top comedy and action scenes you never thought could be made in this day and age. I highly recommend everyone to go watch this movie in the cinema as you will not appreciate it on a home TV otherwise.The transformers never looked out of place, they seemed to belong to the scenery in fact which is what a lot of modern day action epics seem to be flawed in.The comedy value in the movie was amazing as well, i haven't laughed so hard at times in actually comedy movies, and i never heard the audience laugh so loud either.As i mentioned before, i never saw the transformers as a child. If anyone mentioned that word to me all i could say to them is robots and optimus prime but i still understood the movie fully so absolutely anyone could watch and enjoy the marvel that is Transformers.Rarely do i buy dvds, but this is a sure one to get and if a get another opportunity to watch this movie in the cinema, i will happily do it.","Jul 31, 2007",10,/10
"All i know about Transformers is that it's a huge toy brand with a mass following that spawned a TV show and a film in the 80s. So, when i first heard that a live action film was going to be made i wasn't excited at all. I don't mean to offend any fans, but neither the toys or the cartoons had any effect on me during my childhood. I always found them ""silly"". However, with the release of trailers i knew Transformers the film was going to be one of the most visually stunning films and that it was aiming to have mass appeal.The film did not disappoint. It was realistic and original. However, it did leave me wanting more. Firstly, the cast was spectacular. Shia LaBeouf impresses the most out of everyone and the Transformers are great in design and personality. Not once during the film did the visual effects ""lose it"". They were truly flawless.The first half of the film is a charm. The humor is fantastic and the films story develops well. It's truly a crowd pleaser and i can even see my parents enjoying it. However, as the film progresses and more Transformers are introduced, less character development takes place. Hence, amongst the jaw dropping battle scenes in the second half of the film i felt hardly any emotion towards the Transformers and i kinda got out of touch from the film. Only Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are well fleshed characters that i came to care for. Furthermore, one aspect of the film that annoyed me is casting an Australian with a thick Australian accent in what is essentially an American role and film. To those who have seen the film, they may feel as i do, that her accent was a slight negative factor, too distracting and annoying.Despite the lack of Transformer character development the film is a spectacular beginning to what i hope will be a spectacular franchise. It was very refreshing to watch after a number of underwhelming and disappointing summer sequels. Unlike those other films, this film had heart and it delivered a strong message that is relevant to us all today. However, lets just hope with sequels that it continues on as well as it has begun. Maybe Spielberg who acted as Executive Producer could take over the directors chair.","Jun 27, 2007",7,/10

"This is again the strongest summer action sci-fi movie of the year , and I hope that Spielberg - Bay cooperation will continue as we need quality stuff that dreams are made of ! It is funny to see how important are certain things for young generation , as are the action Hasbro Transformers toys and figures . After seeing the movie , my younger brother immediately went to buy himself one of the toys ,soon the whole collection will be created , I am afraid ! In short , this is , thankfully , a film for boys , although the romance between two main characters is pretty believable , not to mention the music in the older Camarro with the sun in the background , mystical ! Again , the cheapest summer movie( believe it or not !) with incredible special effects, perhaps THE BEST EFFECTS EVER ( Oscar without competition ! ) , and the story that is a) not trying to find another artistic and deep - rooted traumas and meanings, thus making the whole business senseless and brainless b) is funny and simple and makes this what a summer flick is supposed to be : a brain relaxation and an eye candy ! Get behind the wheels of your GM vehicle and enjoy the ride !","Sep 25, 2007",7,/10
"Optimus Prime says ""Ooops, My Bad"" during a 25 minute long (I timed it because I was so bored in the theatre) sitcom gag of hide-my-robot-pals from my parents. Furthermore the film really isn't about Robots transforming and fighting their rival tribe. It's about: 1. A young kid trying to score with the class bimbo. 2. Computer analysts stealing government files and trying to crack a code while playing Dance Dance Revolution, telling the police not to step on grandma's carpet or she will get very, very angry, eating donuts and all the jokes that go along with eating donuts. 3. A wise-cracking Government inspector getting peed on and taking off his clothes. 4. How annoying it is to have to talk to an Indian guy when you dial long-distance. Perhaps if I would have known it was a comedy, I would have known what to expect. The robots take a back seat to a bunch of wisecracks. I went in with low expectations and was physically sickened by how bad this film was.","Jul 23, 2007",1,/10
"What is there to say about this movie? Simply stunning and one hell of an eye candy of a movie!Cant keep being critic to point of even saying this is bad movie because the truth is it isn't! Michael Bay with his crew managed to bring about something which most directors can't... AND thats deliver something which keeps to the old by sticking to the original formula which made it work in the 1st place with fresh new look.Anyone saying this movie isn't worth anything get LOST. By the way great TV show.... but back to seriousness at hand here.... Am glad Michael Bay has done this movie and hope for him to do more. I was one of them non believers and after watching the final trailer there was some hope in there that this movie was going to be worth watching. I watched, I loved! and reason being, kept the robots feeling like the cartoon an even including some old school lyrics by Optimus from old '84 movie. And Acting wasn't bad either so kept the movie epic, what else you wanted? This isn't 80s anymore and if you think everything can be done like films of old, think again! This movie shows an proves the technology we have now days for awesome special FX movies can go beyond still. And am glad there wasn't more over-the-top fights between robots AND more types of robots!! Why? Well, why throw EVERYTHING in the 1st movie? All i saying, Sequel ASAP! This movie is EPIC, nuff sayd Thank you","Jul 26, 2007",10,/10
"The thing that strikes you the most while watching the movie ""Transformers"" is not how spectacular its special effects are or how ferociously its action sequences come across on screen, but rather how very FUNNY so much of the movie manages to be. After having sat stone-faced through many of the alleged ""comedies"" foisted upon us in recent months - ""Evan Almighty,"" ""License to Wed,"" even ""Shrek the Third,"" to name just a few - I'm pleased to announce that I laughed quite a bit throughout the course of ""Transformers"" - and I do mean good-sized belly-laughs, not mere titters or snickers. Prime credit for that obviously goes to screenwriters, Roberto Orci and Ales Kurtzman, but I would be remiss if I didn't also acknowledge Shia LaBeouf's contributions in this regard. In this his first certified blockbuster, LaBeouf finally achieves the superstardom he's been steadily heading towards the past several years.As everyone already knows, ""Transformers"" is based on a phenomenally successful line of Hasbro toys as well as the animated series derived therefrom. Transformers are giant robots from outer space who have the ability to metamorphose into the shape of virtually any everyday mechanical device - cars, cell phones, boom boxes etc. - they so desire. In the film, the transformers have just arrived on earth in search of a mysterious box that has the power to create an army of such robots that, given unbridled freedom, would be able to take over the world. Some of the transformers have evil intentions while others have an affinity for mankind and do their best to keep us out of the clutches of the bad guys. LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a brainy, perpetually tongue-tied (especially when he's trying to impress the unreachable girl of his dreams) social outcast whose father agrees to help him buy a rundown Camaro that, unbeknownst to either of them, is actually a good transformer in disguise just waiting for Sam to become his owner.It goes without saying that, on a strictly technical level, the transformers have made a stunning transition to the live action format. There are brief moments when they appear a trifle fake, but director Michael Bay keeps the action moving along at such a dizzying pace, that we rarely have time to notice that flaw. I'm not one who normally goes in for Bay's cuisinart style of movie-making - near-subliminal quick cuts mixed in with endless explosions and rafter-rattling sound effects - but I think it works quite well in this instance. He's also blessed in having LaBeouf as his lead actor, for it is LaBeouf's non-threatening All-American Boy looks and wide-eyed innocence that give the movie the emotional grounding it needs to be more than just the lumbering mechanical creation it could easily have become without him. In fact, whenever he isn't on screen, the movie does, indeed, threaten to devolve into just the standard popcorn action movie filled with jaw-dropping special effects but minus a heart or soul (the transformers themselves are never very interesting as characters and they are stuck mouthing sappy platitudes whenever they do get a chance to speak). But LaBeouf brings to the movie the human dimension it needs to keep our interest.Kevin Dunn and Julie White are thoroughly delightful as Sam's well-meaning but utterly befuddled parents, while Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson also score high on the laughter meter. For purposes of gravitas, movie veterans Jon Voight and John Turturro are also along for the ride.And quite a ride it turns out to be, I must say. ""Transformers"" has pretty much everything a modern-day blockbuster needs to be successful. But it is the rare good humor with which the movie plays its hand that is so completely unexpected - and so very much appreciated in this quarter.","Jul 16, 2007",7,/10
"If you like watching things move around and explode, you'll absolutely love Tranformers. However if you also want a movie to have a basic storyline then maybe Tranformers is not for you.There is so incredibly little story or character development, even for a movie about killer robots from outer space. If they can afford all those CGI effects, surely they can afford better writers? What was with the whole backyard scene? It was completely pointless. Whatever happened to the power-struggle between Starscream and Megatron? I don't mind a few small plot holes, but why didn't the decepticons just buy the damn thing off of eBay and have it sent to them!? It makes the chases and the fighting all the more ridiculous when you think about that. And the all too obvious open door to a sequel was just laughable.Anyway, it's mainly an action movie and the first helicopter attack seemed promising, but after that it moves from one car chase or explosion to the next. There's no build-up or suspense, there's no dynamics, it just turns the volume to 10 for the rest of the movie. What also bugged me, was that most of the Transformers fighting scenes are obscured by bad camera angles. For example, during the highway scenes, it suddenly cuts to random bystanders, and the action is somewhere off in the distance. And the organic robot design make the fights even harder to follow. First there's a confusing transformation and then two huge piles of scrap metal fighting each other. It's hard to even distinguish an arm or a leg.The movie tries to offer some comic relief but the jokes are painfully unfunny. There's an obnoxious super hacker who lives with his grandma and plays videogames all day, a giant robot ""urinates"" on a government agent for no reason, masturbation jokes, fart jokes: all very tacky. I thought the whole Indian telephone operator scene was just awful.I could go on about the shameless product placement, the pro-military propaganda, the incredible overacting, the stereotyping, the clichés etc. but I won't. I can't believe there are so many positive reviews, this movie is horrible.","Jul 14, 2007",1,/10

"A seemingly unending war rages on between robots who are literally able to transform into most anything you can imagine (primarily cars and planes). The heroic Autobots and evil Decepticons take their war from the fledgling planet of Cybertron right to the middle of Earth. Now the fate of the galaxy and all mankind is left in the hands of Autobot Optimus Prime and his robotic soldiers. ""Transformers"" came about in 1984 and made a splash in the United States with a popular toy line and cartoon series. While definitely nostalgic and effective to a point, the concept is somewhat limited and simple-minded. This is what happens with this mainstream box office dominator which has cleaned up financially, but critically it needs a lube job. A wide range of actors have less personality and heart than the special effects-laden robots which are more reminiscent to those corny 1950s Asian monster entities than to 21st Century cinematic live animation. The film is too long, it lacks substance, it has no tone, it is short on brains, and its pacing is a total train-wreck. Even the visual effects and sound are annoying, distractive, and migraine-inducing. Director Michael Bay continues to make films that please audiences who just want to see lots of explosions. However, he fails to show any growth when it comes to mandatory cinematic elements like screenplay, characterization, storytelling, and even rudimentary aspects of cinematography and editing. Chaotic, loud, and ultimately pointless, ""Transformers"" was better left in the obscurity of its Japanese animated time capsule of the 1980s. 2.5 out of 5 stars.","Aug 3, 2007",,
"I tried to think something sensible to say about Transformers, but came into conclusion, that I really don't have anything else to say, but to say congratulations for the special effects team that worked with the movie.Michael Bay isn't a subtle director who makes important, world changing movies. He is a man, who helms big, loud, stupid, overly sentimental and far too serious movies and he does it with pride and he does it well. Transformers is the statement for his skill of taking an idea that could turn into a great piece of garbage and churn it into a pretty entertaining movie about extraterrestrial robots, teenagers and the possible annihilation of the human race. He hammers the movie together with a sledge hammer and despite he sometimes fails, like he did with the Island, Bay manages to deliver with the Transformers.So yeah, that's all I have to say about this.","Mar 7, 2010",6,/10

"I was a big fan of the original in the 80s, I was that age group that the toys/cartoons targeted. When at first I heard about this, I rolled my eyes and though of how bad it could be.I was very wrong. This is a good film. The story is there, the graphics are great and the lineage of the Transformers is nice. There are a handful of funny moments too. It's nice to see that this isn't one of those films where all of the good parts are represented in the theatrical trailer. That seems to be the case so often now a days.For me, watching the Autobots transform from the cars/trucks etc into the characters we grew up with in the 80's was a great part of the film. You look up at them and go whoa! I remember that from when I was a kid! Good Job Michael Bay!","Sep 25, 2008",10,/10
"Before you read the following review, I want you to be aware of something: I am a huge Transformers nerd. Not big enough to name myself after obscure Japanese Decepticons or anything, but still geeky enough to have amassed a sizable collection of merchandise and regularly cry myself to sleep muttering ""oh Megatron, nobody loves you but me."" Therefore it was with some trepidation that I approached the eagerly awaited live action movie, especially seeing as all the pre-release hype seemed to be focused on Megan Fox bending over a car bonnet. And that it was made by Michael Bay and the last time he made a film with ""tremendous respect for the source material,"" we got the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Thus it is with some relief that I can sit here and tell you that the best thing about Transformers is that isn't a complete disaster. In fact it's really very good and one of the strongest no-brain blockbusters to turn up in a summer that's been filled with them. However, it's not without its faults.Now given my little introduction above, you're probably thinking I'm going to spend the entire word limit complaining about the character designs but I'll try not to. This is an entirely new spin after all and moaning about how Ironhide doesn't look like Ironhide anymore isn't going to achieve anything, (did Frenzy really have to be an irritating gremlin with a comedy voice though?). However, what can't be denied is that the majority of the Transformers in this film have zero characterisation and consequently, in the huge mass of violence that closes the movie, it's sometimes difficult to tell who we are meant to be cheering for. In fact only Optimus Prime gets a decent depiction and even Bumblebee, for all his screen time, is robbed of significant development by being burdened with the irritating gimmick of talking through an in-car radio, effectively ruining any chance of a meaningful, ET-style friendship to develop between him and Sam (Shia Lebeouf).On the plus side though, Lebeouf is really good. In fact, he's probably the best thing about the entire film, high praise indeed considering he's been cast as the human foil for audiences to cling onto when all they really want is two hours of robots smacking the living daylights out of each other. As Sam, he is nerdish enough to convince you that he could slip under the school hottie's radar for five years but at the same time, possesses a charm and sense of humour to ensure he doesn't go walking around with a ""gee whizz, how cool"" demeanour whenever a car explodes.Furthermore, the Spielberg influence is rife and gives the film a welcome degree of comedy. Sam's attempt to hide five robots that are bigger than his house from his delightfully-odd parents is arguably, the highlight of the storyline. It gives the proceedings a very human element which is lacking in all the scenes where Sam doesn't appear - the attempts to humanise the soldiers in the generic military combat zone at the beginning for instance are horribly cheesy and serve only to let anyone who's seen more than five films know that they'll be dead within seconds.And then there's the action. Where would a Michael Bay film be without action? And Transformers delivers the goods but sadly, doesn't deliver them enough. Three scenes really stand out: the Decepticon helicopter Blackout's introductory rampage, Prime's highway duel with Bonecrusher and Starscream's mid-air scrap with the US air force. Each of these moments is a terrific jolt of adrenalin but by and large, the robot on robot combat is a let down. Credit that to Bay's love of wildly over the top camera movements and inability to stay still for a second, as Bumblebee's ruckus with Barricade, and Ironhide scrapping with Devastator become confusing spectacles where it isn't clear who is meant to be hitting who. Alongside this is the fact that for large portions of the film, the robots, especially the Decepticons, are conspicuously absent, to the extent where your mind starts to wander while waiting for the next fight.Aside from these few complaints however is the sense that they tried to make the scope a bit too grand. The majority of the story is told from Sam's point of view, but at time it veers off to show events from the perspective of the military and a team of code-breakers. This fractures the story development and in truth, the film would have been far better if they'd narrowed their focus a bit and concentrated solely on Sam.But like I said, the good news is that Bay, Spielberg et al haven't ruined the franchise. Indeed, despite the impression I might be giving, Transformers is a very enjoyable movie and I welcome the prospect of future sequels, its just that I was always going to be bit extra-critical of this film. There is an undeniable degree of childhood excitement to be had watching the first transformation sequence and seeing Optimus Prime act like Optimus Prime, while at the same time sounding like Optimus Prime is a pure nostalgic treat. When it comes to it, for all the plot holes and complaints I've picked up on, the only thing that's liable to ruin Transformers for anyone is the fact that the Decepticons are rarely on screen, especially Megatron and Starscream who only show up for about five minutes each. If you're not a geek, add another two stars to the score.","Aug 1, 2007",7,/10
"Wow... just wow. How can anyone say this was good? Far too much of this film was zoomed in so close that you couldn't even tell what was happening. In the fight scenes you couldn't tell Autobot from Decepticon. The movie focused FAR too much on the human side of things... it is after all supposed to be about TRANSFORMERS. The choice of music for each scene was possibly the worst I have ever witnessed. I think if a real director had made this movie it would have been much better. Terrible script, average acting, continuously disorienting screenplay, tragically bad music choices. The only redeeming features were the special effects and cinematography, and special effects can be taken for granted these days and should really only rate a mention when poor.","Jul 1, 2007",3,/10
"I've literally come to IMDb.COM after watching this movie. Transformers 2007 is now, easily, my number one all time movie. I'm going watch it again... I have never seen a film before where everything was incredible. Small pockets of humour, amazing special effects, government conspiracies, car chases and some totally kick ass fight scenes. I am going to buy this the instant it is released and watch it again and again... The girl is hot, the cars are hotter and Optimus Prime got some balls, eventually. I want everyone to forget about critics (just in case they slag it, i don't actually know what they are saying but they are usually bad mouthing good films) and at least go to the pictures to watch this fantastic movie.

"I grew up watching Transformers on and off. I knew who the good and bad guys were, but I never got the whole plot of the cartoon series. To me, it was just a cartoon with vehicles that can turn into robots and forever fighting. It was mostly dreary (to me). After all, what would you expect out of a girl who was clearly more interested in watching Tom and Jerry?Watching this movie found me in a theatre full of children that got me puzzling if they even knew that there was a cartoon called Transformers. The plot of the movie was entertaining, funny and mostly flawless. However, I guess most of the humour was lost on children too young to even understand the dialogue.The graphics were lovely, the cars lovelier still. The movie actually got me interested in wanting to know what comes next and rooting for the characters. To sum it up, I was kept at the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie.If there is to be a sequel, I look forward to it, minus the children.","Jul 2, 2007",7,/10
"Let me start off with this. I loved Transformers as a kid and I love a fun, mindless action movie (like Crank or Die Hard) This is one of the most overrated films ever made. The special effects look pretty good, but the action is poor, the acting is awful, the story is bland, and the humor is irritating.OK, so the logic holes are Gigantic. For example, Bernie Mac plays a car salesman who Sam (Shia Labeouf) tries to buy a car from. One of the cars is bumblebee. Bumblebee (somehow) blows up the windows of every other car. Sam takes Bumblebee home and neither he or his father question what the hell just happened.Megan Fox is hot, but she's a terrible actress. John Tutorro is great, but he's really chewing up the scenery here. Josh Duhemal and Tyrese Gibson aren't given much to do. Shia Labeouf is so-so.But we don't care about that stuff right? I mean this is an action movie. Too bad that there are barely any robot fights in a film called transformers. For instance, in one scene Shia Labeouf and Megan fox are running away from a decepticon. Bumblebee starts fighting it, but instead of focusing on Bumblebee fighting, we focus on those stupid teenagers running. Screw That. I wanna see robots fight. This film is more about the humans than the transformers.When the robot fights do happen, it's pretty poorly filmed and none of the fights are terribly engaging.We don't even meet Megatron for like 90 minutes and we don't meet optimus for like an hour. Lame. I don't care about a couple of stupid teenagers and their car.And the whole plot revolves around Ebay? That's a real cool idea for an action movie. ugh.And the ""humor"" is awful. The only funny scene in the whole movie was the doughnut joke. Everything else was just stupid.If you truly are a Transformers fan, don't waste your time. This film sucks","Jan 30, 2011",1,/10
"I don't know why people have bashed this film in reviews when the preview of this movie came out. I read all the time where some poster claims to be a moviefest buff and knows somebody to get to see advanced press screenings before the press screenings and they down play a movie like this simply because it doesn't follow up to traditional standards. I'm glad I don't take these kind of people seriously and check things out for myself.To be honest, I never planned on seeing the movie because I for one grew out of the Hasbro camp long ago but by mere opportunity I seen this today with my son due to be late for another movie.I must say that that I am happy that I've gotten my money's worth because there wasn't a dull moment for me. I don't know who created this offering or why but they did a great job on this one.If you like sci-fi, a little teen drama and non-stop action then this is the movie for you. The CGI FX in this is awesome and that's saying a lot since I am not an avid fan of CGI. Plus the movie had it's funny parts. Go see this one folks.","Jul 28, 2007",10,/10
"I don't hate blockbusters, but what I do hate is bad film making, especially ones that use flashy, state-of-the-art CGI to make up for a rubbish script. Transformers is a case of this, I think and that's just one of it's many flaws.Watching it again (in preparation for the sequel), my opinion has changed a lot from nearly two years ago when I was entertained by it. I had a feeling this was one of those disposable films that I'd see once and never touch it again, and I was right, cause it's bad, and here's why:Acting: Judging from what I saw, this wanted the robots to play second fiddle to what was mostly a human story. Shame the humans lack interest, cause all I saw wavered shockingly poor to mediocre acting and the most one-dimensional characterisation I've seen in a while, along with cheesy, cringe worthy dialogue.LaBeouf plays Sam, the main teen high-school boy in this, like deer caught in headlights. This constant panicky expression makes for a more weaker hero. Fox's character is our hero's crush, but she looks around 25 and dresses like a stripper. Her acting is very wooden and self-conscious, but since she's eye candy, she fulfils her purpose of being pretty to look at well, even if she looks nearly a decade older than her co-star. Duhamel and Gibson are bland as the two main soldiers - there's a particularly scene of unconvincing acting from Gibson in Qatar as Scorponok is tunnelling in the sand behind them. Turturro's manic and wacky performance is just unfunny and Voight on autopilot. Taylor ranges from mediocre to unbelievable and Anderson just plays a 'comic relief' stereotypical black man - a lot of the jokes fall flat and his character is annoying and unnecessary.Much of the only good, noteworthy acting comes from the voice-over acting for the robots. Cullen's gravely, authoritative tone, especially at the very end of the film gave me goosebumps and even made some of the worst and most clichéd lines sound genuine. Harnell's voice too is good.Cutting out the whole military sub-plots and the hackers would've concentrated the story on Sam and his family and the robots, which would've improved it slightly, but you're still left with that god-awful script.Plot: Yet another vital flaw - the plot is vague and undeveloped. The narrative is severely lacking and even the basics of it, about a Allspark cube are laughable, yet this is all presented quite seriously. Scenes to be taken seriously are quite unintentionally funny.So, it's 'plot', if it can be called that, is just a thin narrative that doesn't make much sense, as it hasn't been thoughtfully though from the start. I was bothered by the lack of a good villain in Megatron - we're only shown a small flashback of his apparent wickedness, but he doesn't come across as a strong enough, feared antagonist. It sure doesn't help that his little dialogue is as silly as they come: 'give me the cube!'.The origin of the robots could've been shown more in the opening. As a result of limiting what we know about the title characters themselves, there's no emotional investment in them much, and when one Autobot is killed, it doesn't have any impact. The same one-dimensional approach is used for the cardboard cutouts that are the humans.So, a superficial 'plot' and characters leave me cold. The particular scenes with sentimentality feel shoehorned in and the whole onanism part is so stupid and inappropriate. Add the silly romantic bits and it feels so contrived, I'm surprised that this script was green-lighted.Cinematography: Bay loves to pan the camera right to left, left to right, 360 degrees around someone, over used slow-mo, insert panning aerial shots and close ups that gradually come closer - very rarely does the camera stay still. Scenes lasting five to ten seconds mostly also have a quick cut editing technique throughout. Ironically enough, these film trailer-like scenes end up in an overlong film, with a self-indulgent tone, especially in big set pieces.The explosions and general action scenes are unwatchable and tiresome because of this approach. I hate watching a film shot in an ADD type way, especially when ineptly done. Yes, the CGI is photo-real and great, but those computer effects don't deserve a film as badly done as this.The main seven action scenes don't redeem the film and all share one thing in common - a lack of tension or suspense. That lack of restraint and diligence creates an air of impatience in me. The end climatic part ended on a very weak note.Overall: Only the CGI for the robots, really good voice acting for Prime and the lovable Bumblebee were it's few good points. Apart from that, the film is brainless, bloated, clichéd and is a tedious experience to endure. Even the humans are horribly written, the action sequences with the robots sound like pots clanging together (which is weird for such large and heavy cybernetic organisms) and are a chore to follow who's beating up who. Stupid panning shots, fast cut editing and bad, cheap jokes makes this one of the worst sci-fi action films I've seen, so far. There's no heart in it - just one long advert for cars, eBay and the Transformers toys. A film made primarily for lads mag reader, since it doesn't have anything to offer apart from visuals.There's nothing wrong with making a fun blockbuster, but at least get a good story , fully realised characters with normal non-panning pacing before you start principle photography. Kids making up stories while playing with their toys is more entertaining than all 2 hours 15 mins of this and probably more creative.","Jun 19, 2009",,
"What can be said about the Transformers that hasn't been said already? What haven't they been turned into? Surely you can't mention Transformers without the various cartoon series that have been created since the show and its beginning in 1984, or the annoying spin-offs from it. You can't deny they haven't been made into action figures, and you cannot forget the video games that have seen light on the PS2 and other systems, and of course, the Original Cartoon Movie cannot be forgotten. It seems like by now, Transformers have been recognized in several different forms of media, and are household names to America.Looking at Michael Bay, whose resume includes such horrid films as the Bad Boys movies, Armageddon (we all really like it because of the soundtrack, admit it) and the 3+ Hour Pearl Harbor (Which is probably the longest three hours anyone has sat through), it's too hard to say whether the reputation of the Transformers could be made better or tarnished by Bay and his direction of a long running cartoon show.However, Bay pulls off a movie that definitely does not sit on my top favorite movies of 2007 (His ranks lowest, against 1. Pirates 3, 2. Harry Potter 5 and 3. Ratatouille) but still makes a movie that I enjoyed watching in the theater, but I doubt I'll want to see again.Here's a brief summary: Sam Witwicky (Played Fantastically by Shia LeBeouf) is a junior in High School who gets what looks like a automobile that has something about it, something that the Dealer states (""A driver don't pick the cars. Cars pick the driver."") and soon gains a vehicle that looks like a nice way to pick up chicks (like Megan Fox's character, Mikaela), but has something more to it. It's an Autobot named Bumblebee, one of several seen in the movie.At the same time, in Qatar (Brush up on your geography for this one), several men fighting for the war (Played by Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson) get attacked by strange machines in the desert. Suddenly, the war turns to be battle between man and machine, but where do they come from? Are one of our allies (or Enemies) trying to take us out with special technology unlike any other seen before? As the movie advanced, it felt like it was going nowhere a bit too fast. A strange transmission that sounds like garbled talking on a shorting out walkie-talkie is the main focus for the most part, until we advance a bit more, and finally see some action.I will give Michael Bay this credit: He knows how to pace, to a point. His development on all the characters are significant enough to have time to explain them all, but it's a 2 hour, 24 minute movie. There must be a lot of fighting, right? Strangely enough, fighting doesn't occur enough.When a lot of money is being put into making a movie of this caliber, you'd expect a lot of fighting, especially since Transformers seem like they would be awesome fighters, but the movie has at least a maximum of 25 minutes of fighting, while the rest of the film is mostly character development that drags itself out to the point where it's not even character development anymore, it's just trying to extend the movie out until its large finale, but then even the fighting at the end is not enough. I craved for more.The audience that was there spent a lot of the movie in the bathroom or snack bar until the fight scenes came on, otherwise, a lot were talking and became bored. I was getting a bit annoyed with a movie this talked about and this big had less action than previously imagined.One thing about this movie that I enjoyed was the fact there the cast is having fun (sort of), little jokes and sight gags were pretty good, and the audience got a laugh when it was implied for you to laugh.I will say Michael Bay has made an okay movie. It's flaws are that it's a bit too long, and spends a lot of its time trying to move the plot, but tiptoes to the end instead of making it in bounds and leaps, and takes a long time to deliver action instead of granting us our wish of constant combat.As for the positives, the acting is well done, the characters have personalities (At least LaBeouf's and Fox's characters do) as well as the Autobots, and the film has a good way of recognizing when it's trying to be funny, while keeping in context of the T.V. Show.I give this movie a 7 out of 10.","Jul 27, 2007",7,/10
"That's a bold statement. The greatest summer blockbuster ever? No question. If you want to have fun at the movies, look no further. Transformers is a masterpiece in visual effects and its brilliant writing and direction. Michael Bay continues to show why he is one of the most bankable producers/directors in Hollywood with probably his best effort of his career. Transformers is one of my all time favorite movies, and the only movie that I would watch any day of the week. Whether it be the incredible action sequences, great jokes, the great and likable Shia LaBeouf, the gorgeous Megan Fox, the just flat out awesome Optimus Prime, or the downright evil Megatron, Transformers has something for every type of movie goer.Long ago, the dueling Autobots and Decepticons fought over the power source known as the Allspark, or simply, the cube. Now that the cube has found its way to Earth, the battling alien races have brought their struggle to our planet, and it appears that young lovable loser Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) holds the key to Earth's safety or destruction.First off, Transformers boasts what you could call spectacular special effects and action sequences. They are astonishingly real and well made. Nothing looks fake. The Transformers themselves are sometimes hard to distinguish because of the speed they are fighting at, but it's a non issue. I am ready to give Transformers the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. I've never been more stunned by visuals. Michael Bay really put a ton of effort into the film, and of course, his trademarks are present, such as the sun casting a bright light over the hero in the finale, but Bay has created a film that he can not only call his, but a film for everyone. This is why we go to the movies, to have experiences that leave us wowed, make us laugh, and stick with us for a long time. Michael Bay has guaranteed that this will happen.The cast is great. They do what they need to and don't take anything away from the movie, sometimes adding more. Shia LaBeouf has really blossomed into a bankable leading man. It's so great to see him really succeed, and seeing how likable and great he is in this movie, I can see why. Megan Fox, aside from being drop dead gorgeous, has her own moments where she and LaBeouf really play off each other well. I liked Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. Anthony Anderson was good, as was screen legend Jon Voight. I liked his character, who seemed really realistic. I didn't care for John Turturro, as he seemed really out of place, and he felt awkward in most scenes he was in. He tried to be funny in moments where it wasn't necessary.Ah, now the voice actors. All are cast great, especially the leading Autobot Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the especially vile Megatron (Hugo Weaving). Cullen has been the voice of Prime for years, and I wouldn't have it any other way. He gives a warm and kind voice that also does a great job of enforcing his power as the leader. Weaving has one of the best voices in show business, with this and V for Vendetta being the best examples. It's amazing how a man who was so kind and likable in V could come back with a voice full of menace and cruelty and downright scare the audience. Though he's animated, Megatron is one of the top bad guys of the 2000's.Transformers will never relent with the entertainment. It's got everything, including awkward teen romance parts, intense action, catchy dialog, a great soundtrack, and sometimes laugh out loud humor. I've never had this much fun at the movie theater and I really recommend that you catch it on DVD and watch it on the biggest TV with the best sound system you can. It's the best of the legendary 2007 summer. In a summer of sequels, the newbie, Transformers, stands clear above the rest. I love this movie and recommend it to everyone.10/10 --spy","Sep 19, 2007",10,/10
"A young teenager discovers his new, used Camaro is in actuality a robot from another planet. Said robot we eventually learn is getting ready for battle with some other automobile themed comrades against a team of deceptive evil alien robots also capable of transforming into machines with the Earth as their final battleground.Big, Dumb Comic Book Action Adventure brought to life. Is kept afloat by a likable lead cast, lots of explosions, and some cool giant robots. Overlooking the fact this has plot holes and a lack of credibility big enough to drive an Optimus Prime sized Mack truck through, it's entertaining enough in its popcorn summer blockbuster fashion.","Dec 30, 2007",6,/10
"Yeah, I know it was three words. But much like this fantasmagorical movie, you will definitely get more than you bargained for or paid for.There is something for everyone in this flick and all members of the human race will see themselves in at least one of the numerous characters. For a near 3 hour movie, nothing drags, every scene movies forward to the next and keeps you on the edge of the seat. My cool barometer, my 15 y/o daughter thought it was a shorter movie than Pirates which is roughly the same length.When an autobot gets his legs amputated, and he still rocks onward, I am sure every kid in a wheelchair feels like he wants to go kick some decepticon a$$. A the end of this movie the entire theater erupted in an impromptu raucous applause, the likes of which I have never seen in near 30 years of movie going.While it is rumored Transformers cost a whopping 155 million dollars, they will easily make it all back and then some. If a Transforer toy come out after this I for one will buy the damn thing..yup, and I'm 46 years young to boot.GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10
"I had no knowledge of the transformers before this beyond a few vague memories of toy cars that turn into robots. I hadn't even realised there were good robots and bad robots until I saw this.The movie starts off with an attack on a military base by an unknown robot thing that resembles a scorpion. The military are unsure whether anyone survived, which a few soldiers did. There is also an attack on the computer system, with the firewalls all being hacked within seconds. The military bring in a group of hackers to try to work out where a strange sound heard at the time originated from. Meanwhile Sam Witwicky has to write about an ancestor at school and tells the story of his grandfather, an explorer who lived the last years rambling about a monster in the ice and Sam is trying to flog a lot of his old belongings on EBay to buy a car. Sam's Dad takes him to buy a second hand car and he ends up with a beaten up yellow car he soon discovers can turn into a robot.To cut a long story short, one hacker works out where the signal comes from and Sam's car is joined by a group of Transformers who explain that their world was destroyed and new Transformers are made with ""The Cube"". Sam's grandfather found a frozen Megatron who was determined to create a new race of Transformers, the Decepticons. The small group, led by optimus Prime, are called Autobots and they have to stop Megatron from being released and finding the cube. Of course the military have Megatron in a big freezer, just waiting for the hacker Decepticons to defrost and let loose when they find out who Sam and where they can find their master.First, this movie looks great. The action scenes are spectacular with great effects and a great combination of people trying to destroy the Decepticons and the Autbots having their own battle with them. The plot, for me, was a bit bizarre but if you don't question it it's easy enough to follow. I don't know how much of this followed the original legend.As for the actors, it's funny how all the guys look geeky except the hunky soldier types and the girls, even the hacker girl, all look like they belong in a magazine. Hmmm, definitely a boy's movie this, even without all the fancy cars and robots.The movie was far funnier than I was expecting, although from what I know not everyone is a fan of the humour in it. I liked that the Autobots all had their own personality and that their leader was almost like a school teacher looking after a disruptive class for some of the time. The voice actors all did very well, with Optimus Prime especially sounding austere and frustrated at the correct times.All in all a good fun movie, but I won't be buying it. Definitely one for the kids with the big robots and the teenage boys with lots of hormone candy of both the female and machine varieties. I'd have no problems taking kids to see this although there is some mild swearing, but the nature of most of the action scenes are fine for kids, there's no blood, just bits of metal.","Jul 30, 2007",6,/10

All I have to say about this movie is I came out with an ear to ear grin on my face. I think it was a perfect adaptation of the original series. I don't think gogkiran-2 who gave it 4 stars has seen the original series anytime recently and how bad it really was. Was awesome when I was 6 but when I watched it again last month it was slightly painful. Third season very painful. I like in the movie how serious it was: the bad guys could aim and shoot and hit and when they got damaged it hurt. Cities could collapse under a fight from just two of them. Very much how it should be. Yes it was full of clichés and cheese but considering the source it still kicked butt! Awesome movie and an awesome time. Highly recommended.,"Sep 21, 2007",10,/10
"First things first, as even the title state, the movie is called Transformers, so by default the story is shallow. Now shallow is not that bad if its written good, but it is not the case. There are to many sidelines that are just thrown in the story and linked together without any apparent reason ( the blonde analyst chick with the Aussie accent and the black hacker would have been so much greater if they were just cut out of this movie, and there was just to much about parents - children relationship at the beginning, I mean masturbation a.k.a. happy hour? stepping on the grass, trash cans? come on......)Now, when you see Michael Bay as director on a movie poster, you pretty much know what to expect, and that is action at its finest. Given the fact that we have 2 giant robot factions fighting each other kind of hand to hand, Bay doesn't disappoints, and delivers some fine shot action. Basically, the robots are great and they fight accordingly.The actors are appropriate for this movie. Jon Voight brings some pedigree to the movie, but it shows that this role was accept to pay the rent rather than to claim critics. Shia LaBeouf ain't bad, but it could have been Justin Long in his place or any other young actor with a highscool kid face, it really doesn't matter. Megan Fox is a fox, plane and simple, she is hot. Besides the robots she is the only edge that this move has got. All the other actors are just annoying and mostly unnecessarily present, especially Anthony Anderson. No matter in what I see him, he is always an annoying loudmouth. Attitude and verbal diarrhea with a high volume. Fire him.In a nutshell, good action, great robots, one FINE girl.

"This movie had more character development than I usually would expect from Hollywood flicks these days and for that my pleasure viewing it was heightened. Though this is to be expected since it's based on a series that has been around for a while. My only main gripes are that the pacing towards the end of the movie seemed to be much too fast compared to the beginning. The vehicles in the movie looked real nice. The CGI was done incredibly well. Character interaction generally seemed more authentic than I was hoping for so that was a plus.Overall, it's enjoyable and at least worth renting. I suggest if you have a free day with nothing else better to do, pick it up. I give it a 7/10.","Nov 5, 2007",7,/10

"I finally got to see this after years of following the creation of it from the initial rumors to the announcement of Bay as director and so on. I was a very big Transformers fan in the 80s, and I'd consider playing with the toys to be a big part of my childhood. They were the last major toys I played with before puberty kicked in, so they have lingered as my favorites from back then.My feelings about the movie are mixed. I'll start with the good (which is always shorter because it's less interesting).It was the best Michael Bay movie I've seen. Granted, I've pretty much disliked everything else I've seen from him and I haven't seen everything. Armageddon remains the worst big-budget movie I've ever seen. But Transformers was a step up for Bay. The special effects were awesome and believable, and it was very cool to see the Transformers brought to life on screen. It's funny, I can remember saying after seeing Jurassic Park way back when digital effects were coming into their own that maybe they could make a live action Transformers, and lo and behold, here it is. The movie is visually arresting, and there are a couple of strong performances from Shia LeBouf and John Turturro. There's some humor and a good sense of fun with it.Now the negatives.For one, the robots didn't feel as much like individual characters as they did on the old cartoon. Their faces didn't look as much like faces, which is part of it. But they also looked too similar. The originals all looked quite a bit different. In robot form, they retained more of the look of the vehicles and other items they became. In the cartoon, you could see emotion on their faces and hear it in their voices. In the movie they were more like true robots. There also was no real portrayal of the relationships between the transformers. There was a bit of differentiation when the Autobots were introduced, but it wasn't too much. The Decepticons still all pretty much seemed the same.There were some regular Michael Bayisms that I didn't like either. Heroes are too heroic and bad guys are too bad, especially for a PG-13 movie. Granted, that's how it was in the source material initially, but over time, the Transformers cartoon became more nuanced, with characters rethinking their positions and switching sides and issues of insanity in Decepticon leadership making some Decepticons question what they were doing. The show became more sophisticated as it went. Perhaps it is understandable that the sophistication level dropped, but I had hoped the PG-13 rating would mean more adult themes. No, just a few more curse words.Another Michael Bayism I dislike is the glorification of violence. Now, I don't mind violent movies, but I don't like it when movies put a nice sheen on violence. If you're going to show violence, you should show its results. If you are going to show robots shooting up streets and crashing through buildings, you need to show some bodies. The original cartoon had most of its action happening in very isolated areas. The movie had a huge fight sequence in a major city and robots flying through buildings where it was actually shown that there were people working inside. A lot of people have a problem with violence in films. I have a problem not with violence but with a dishonest portrayal of it that hides its negative results.I also thought there were some lazy stretches of believability. The government trying to cover up what happened in the end by burying the bodies at sea was stupid because obviously people would know, seeing as how a city got ripped apart and there had to have been reporters capturing it. Also, the military leadership was way too honest with the public, with the Secretary of Defense telling people on air that they had no idea what had attacked them in the desert and all that.Yet another Michael Bayism is to depict military and political officials as simplistic, honest men who are purely heroic. Now, I think the portrayal of the soldiers themselves was actually pretty good, but the Sec Def is much more of a political position and I thought the character was basically too honest and straightforward.I wasn't too bothered by the physical differences between the original versions and new versions of the vehicle forms of the Transformers. The change in Bumblebee's car form worked for the movie and the old versions were very 1980s anyway. How can you make a movie now where all the vehicles look like they're from the 1980s? However, I didn't like that they changed the basic nature of some of the characters. Bonecrusher and Devastator were two separate characters. In the original, Devastator was formed by combining five robots into one, and one of them was Bonecrusher. It is also a sin that Megatron turns into a plane and not some kind of big ol' gun. He didn't look nearly enough like the original Megatron to me.Okay, I guess I've put enough effort into reviewing what was essentially a silly summer popcorn movie. It's just that it was a big part of my childhood, so I had a lot to say.","Jul 23, 2007",6,/10
"WARNING, SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN.Very much in the spirit of the original, and my observation is that the prime audience is people like myself who grew up on the Transformers. Almost everyone left the cinema with big grins on their faces (the only ones who didn't were the few ladies who had clearly been dragged by their significant other), I haven't seen such a contented cinema audience in such a long time.I was surprised at the amount of comedy in the film as well, but it was well done comedy that didn't detract from the overall experience. There was some excellent comedic timing so it all worked rather splendidly, and they knocked the comedy on the head at the mid point when things started to get serious.The CGI and action scenes are simply superb, second to none. The US armed forces in particular seem to have worked very hard with the cast and crew to make this a memorable film as well, I don't think I recall an action movie with such a large military involvement. That said there isn't an overuse of CG and it never comes across and being ladled on too thickly like a lot of recent films.The autobots are just delightful, they've been characterised wonderfully. There are a few snippets of dialogue that will make anyone who grew up on the Transformers have a nostalgic giggle of delight. Peter Cullen's voice acting really makes Prime stand head and shoulders above the rest, although Megatron is superbly voiced. Starscream is actually fairly menacing rather than being all whiny and nasal, one of the only critiques I can level is that some of the decepticons all seem a bit ""samey"", almost like Stormtrooper syndrome. When the action kicks off it's hard to tell who's who whereas the autobots are all bright and colourful so it's easy to tell.The movie ties up most of it's loose ends but sets the scene for the next film. My only major concern is that those who haven't really got an inkling about Transformers will miss a lot of the ""feeling"" of the film, but then I suppose you pay your money and take your chances.Incidentally there is a glimmer of a love story but it's all hinted at and never really gets pushed to center stage. Although the movie has to kick off by focusing on Sam the movie is all about the Transformers, they really do take center stage when the scene setting has all been done. No gripes from me to be honest. In fact the love story is quite often used as the butt of the jokes, which suits me fine. One of my main concerns was that there would be a major love story arc messing up the ass kickery.As a film I'd give it a definite 8.5-9 / 10. Because of the subject matter I'll plump for 10/10 because I'm hopelessly biased.","Jul 24, 2007",10,/10
"As anyone who knows me probably knows I am an avid and outspoken detractor of Michael Bay and all of his films. I've found them to be cheap exploitive and manipulative pieces of substandard film-making that appears to have garnered some attention due to his flashy style of directing. However, Transformers became one of the biggest movies of 2007 and, as such, I had to see the movie if only to have a merited opinion on the film. By the time the Autobots descended on Earth in the form of a meteor shower, one bit actor runs by the screen with a camera, yelling to it that it is ""a hundred times better than Armageddon,"" I sat in the theater and wondered to myself if the actor knew how many volumes of honesty he was just speaking.Transformers not only became the fun and exciting summer movie that I was waiting for all of 2007, but it proved to me that Michael Bay has it in him to make a movie that goes beyond exploitive and sociopathic tendencies, two underlying themes in all of his movies that I couldn't shake to the point where I couldn't enjoy them as passive fun. Here, the bitter angriness against the human race that is evident in all of his previous films has gone and we have a fun slice of juvenile entertainment that it seems that Bay has been waiting to make.For anyone who grew up watching Transformers every Saturday morning, the plot needs no explanation. Autobot transformers battle Decepticon transformers on earth in a bid to protect humanity. However, this Transformers focuses less on the robotic characters than in the American government, a small band of army soldiers and one hyper-testosteroned yet socially inept teenager and his overly hot love interest, all of which sport some very strong and obvious spray on tans.Sam Witwicky, played with youthful gusto by Shia LaBeouf, is given his first car, which happened to be a ""robot in disguise"" named Bumblebee, who was sent to protect Sam, who happens to be in possession of a map to find a key element for both sides of the transformers called the allspark. The autobots want to use the allspark to reignite their destroyed world while the decepticons want to use the device to create their own robotic army. Simple plot, not too hard to follow, but, hey, who needs to see existentialist character pieces in a movie about cars that become robots and fight each other? There are very cheesy moments and lines in the film, there are plot contrivances and there are some very over the top performances, but like I said earlier, this isn't a film that is meant to be scrutinized the way that a Scorcese or Bergman film was meant to be. So the best way to evaluate Transformers would be to judge the action and fun level. In both respects, the movie succeeds if only because it abandons the standard sociopathic Bay mentality and instead focuses on the entertainer that he has always strived to be. If I have a complaint with this film, it's that the camera needed to be pulled back more during some of the action sequences to get a better look at what was going on. Bay's style is very in your face, but there are points where I wanted to see more of the Transformer fights and get a chance to enjoy what I was watching.And before I finish the review here, I have to give credit to the amazing visual effects that this film was able to accomplish. So seamless, on both the big and the small screen, where the effects where interactive machines would all of the sudden transform into the gigantic robots that they were. The very first time a machine transforms into another machine, the effect is so seamless that the movie shows the capabilities that computer effects have come.Transformers is the fun summer film that hearkens back to a time when the blockbusters were entertaining and free spirited, much like Men in Black, Jurassic Park or The Mask. Not only that, but Michael Bay has also stood up to a very challenging task to me: making a movie that has actually made me excited to see his next film.","Oct 27, 2007",7,/10
"This entire film was a flashy commercial, start to finish. The biggest buyer of ad space--the US Army. At least half the movie was a blatant recruitment video, demonstrating myriad military systems working in seamless unison for the millions of children and young adults in attendance. Balderdash. Mountain Dew, Chevy, Pontiac, Hummer, Ford, Panasonic, and GMC are just a few of the other big spenders that were pounded into the minds of the audience.The ""plot,"" if you can call it that, was simply laughable. I can't remember the last time I saw a more cookie-cutteresque, formulaic flick. The whole thing seemed like one big mad-lib. If you've seen more than three movies in your life, you can guess the next ten minutes of the film at any given point. Forget spoilers--whatever you think is about to happen, you're probably right. And talk about a blatant open door to a sequel, which we can probably expect just about this time next year, just in time to promote all the 2009 model year cars, as well as a stream of other crap that's too useless to be sold on its own merits. I'm sure the CG artists have already broken ground on it. First order of business--produce at least 300 45-second, multi-angle, overly-dramatized, ""chunk-chunk-chunk"" sound-effect filled transformation scenes. That'll put them somewhere around half the number in this one.Oh, and make sure you bring all the willful suspension of disbelief you can muster, because you WILL need it if you're to make it through to the end. You couldn't count on one hand the monumental and ridiculously improbable coincidences upon which the threadbare plot depends, even if that hand was holding a calculator. My favorite--someone hotwires a brand new vehicle by opening the door, reaching under the steering column, immediately grabbing two freely dangling and apparently stripped wires and sparking them together. Holy Dukes of Hazzard. Do the makers of this film really believe that America is peopled by such feeble-minded idiots? To squeeze in more action and save the poor viewers from having to think too much, every formula character in the book was pulled out. All the usual suspects were in attendance: the hardcore marine guy, the ""you can't handle the truth""-secret government agency guy (times two!), the hot computer chick, the dorky hero, the embarrassing, out-of-touch parents, the muscle-headed jock and the girl who dates him only to realize she's been dating bad boys for too long, and my personal favorite, the technically inclined but non-threatening black guy. And yes, Megan Fox is slap-your-granny hot, but it's ruined when every other scene she's in shows her with her chin up, mouth open wide, faint glimmer of sweat across her forehead in an obviously forced attempt at looking sexy.This movie isn't a total wash, though. For those of you whose only desire in a film is to see big robots smash stuff (da-hyuck), boy is this the ticket for you! The action IS pretty non-stop, but unfortunately a lot of it is played too fast to really see what's going on--I suspect the CGers did this on purpose to eliminate cost and speed production. There are some decent comedic moments, but most of the jokes fall flat and some are downright inappropriate for my 5 and 7 year old. There was just enough character development for the robots to make you realize that, if they were real people, they would be MTV veejays (one of them break dances for God's sake) and were likely created in committee (think Poochie the dog from The Simpsons). And another thing--their faces were just plain creepy.I had such high hopes for this film, but in the back of my mind I knew it would be turned into an ad bonanza with little to no true tie to the original story. I'm sad to say I was right on the money.","Jul 13, 2007",1,/10

"Last night, my friend and I went to cinema for this film. I read many good reviews on IMDb before going there but I went without any expectation about Transformer because I didn't want to be disappointed by this movie as I was disappointed by Spiderman 3. We took a sit at the very center . After a bunch of advertising the movie finally started. At the very first scenes I felt ""oh oh, really really not bad, it's not gonna suck"" and it really really didn't I sat tight on the chair and stared on the screen from the beginning to the end of the film. It was good, very good. I'm not gonna tell you about what I saw 'cause I want you guy to be curious as hell . Instead, I'm gonna say how good it is.1. The movie scrolls fast enough for you to catch what's going on and not to be bored. Scenes go after scenes and things go after things logically and in an smooth order so that you always can follow what's on the screen. In addition, stupid actions, stupid talks, stupid situations are what you're NOT gonna find while watching Transformer.2. Special effect, it is so stunning. This is what I like the most in this movie. Trust me, this movie will give you an opportunity to see a dozen of beautiful mighty and giant robots. But these huge pals are not merely mechanism, they have feeling and mind and even purposes , so that audience don't have to see fights between bunch of pure metal guys and more importantly this make the movie not to be a cartoon for children. And more about special effect, I really enjoyed the fights in the film, they were made so cool, however, the camera angels in fighting scene seem so close and you'll hardly see who fighting who on the screen.3. Lots of funny stuff. Obviously, most of action films must have something something funny and this rule is like a golden key. However, where and when to put hilarious situations in is not so easy, if the crew did it wrong, the movie would be ridiculous somehow. Fortunately, Transformers really makes sense about when and where and how to make you laugh. This is another aspect to make you enjoy the film.These cool things form a awesome entertaining film which is worth the ticket.Go see it if you don't want to miss a good time","Jul 6, 2007",7,/10
"Please, do not go see this movie.If you are a fan of the Transformers television show, or the original movie, you will be overwhelmingly disappointed.The title of this movie should have been ""Sam Witwicky"" (the main character) because that was what the movie was about. It was not about the Transformers at all.THE BAD: -The first problem is that this movie was about humans, not transformers. In fact you don't really meet any transformers until 45 minutes into the movie, and when you do, they don't talk. The movie is about an awkward teenager, not Transformers. There are only a handful of transformers in the movie. (4 autobots, and about 5 decepticons)-You don't get to know the transformers at all (autobots, or decepticons) They are introduced, by name only, and they give you a 10 second explanation of their individual jobs. They don't really have any lines, you don't get to know their personalities, and you don't see much of them in general. (I understand that there was a tremendous amount of cost and effort put into creating the actual transformers, and live action people are easier to shoot.....but come on. The movie is supposed to be about the Transformers.) -obnoxious product placement (Chevy, GMC, and Burger King just to name a few). These were shameless plugs that got annoying after a while.-The ""comic relief."" It's an action movie, stop trying to make the audience laugh with stupid dialogue, and slap-stickey nonsense. It's frustrating when the writers are clearly trying to appeal to the 10-15 year old PG audience....-Character development. At the end of the film, you'll know more about Sam's parents than you know about most of the main characters. They do not develop characters at all, and furthermore they had a few characters that served no purpose at all.-Complete lack of nostalgia. If you're expecting to see some things that remind you of growing up with the Transformers TV show, you will be disappointed. Aside from the voice of O.P. nothing is similar.THE GOOD: -Best CGI/live action integration yet. This movie finally pulls off seamless CGI. It was beautiful. Just wait kids, now that they know how to do CGI properly, George Lucas will probably re-make Star Wars again...) -They got the original guy to do the voice of Optimus Prime. Awesome.SUMMARY: If you're out to see a mediocre action movie laden with poorly written dialogue, and bad ""humor,"" then go for it.If you're looking for some connection to a fantastic show from your childhood, don't waste your time.If you want to see how CGI should look from now on, take the time, but be prepared for an altogether awful movie.","Jul 8, 2007",3,/10
"I remember when this movie first came out. I was so blown away that when it was available outside of theaters, I watched it over and over. And over again. Repeatedly. You know how it goes, you say the lines while watching, because you've viewed it well over 7,253+ times.I'm an unapologetic diehard ""Bayformer."" The scope and magnitude of the fight scenes and explosions are a joy to behold and unparalleled in excellence. Every one, without exception, are awe inducing scenes of beauty and genius, thrilling my visual and auditory senses and giving me chills. It's a movie with excellent directing and delivery. Kinda weird for a girl to say that, huh?There are some movies that will always be my absolute all-time favorites, right up there with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. This is where I place Michael Bay's Transformers, alongside them, in a stratospheric category where other directors and writers can only dare to dream of reaching.Love love love the lore and the way it was adapted here.Acting spot on, bar none.Julie White (Judy) and Kevin Dunn (Ron) were absolutely perfect for their roles, and perfect with their lines, body language, all of it, no exceptions. No matter what Judy does wrong (and that's no small number), or how embarrassing she is, White keeps Judy unimpeachably adorable. The chemistry between White and Dunn as Sam's parents was flawless and seemingly effortless, a highlight, the proverbial icing on the cake, complementing each others' lines with ease. As the movies continued, I found myself being barely able to wait to see what kind of awkward situations they would get themselves into.John Turturro (Agent Simmons), though really REALLY annoying at first, goes on, though not too much less (perfectly) annoying, to be one of the heroes of the series. I became a huge fan of Turtorro because of his portrayal of Simmons.Josh Duhamel (Captain Lennox) and Tyrese Gibson (Sergeant Epps) were perfectly cast together, no-nonsense Lennox, and Gibson with the complementary perfectly delivered one-liner comedic relief. Loved these two in the movies.I'm not a Megan Fox fan at all, but I couldn't imagine anyone else as Mikaela after I watched the movie a few times. I think what got to me was how far she went to protect Bee.Last but not least, Shia LaBeouf. There is no other Sam. He was so hilariously extra in many of the scenes, but calm and calculating when he needed to be. This was done by LeBeouf, and not by the writing. He brought something to the table that no one else could have pulled off. Whatever he does or doesn't do in real life, love him or hate him, he's Sam Witwicky, and was truly beyond great at the role.Favorite line: ""I wish to stay with the boy."" Got me straight in the feels with a tear and a lump in my throat.And now I'm done with my review. I'm going to watch this movie for the 7,254th time. Despite all the naysayers, It's. Just. That. Good.","Jul 3, 2022",10,/10

"After Transformers was announced for the big screen, the Transformers fan base became a buzz about what it would be like. Would it trounce their childhoods like so many other movies have? Or would it be a carbon copy of the original series right down to the story and Boxformer design? Well, I am happy to announce that it was neither of those. Michael Bay has pulled off something truly special in this new film; he managed to imagine Transformers for a new generation while maintaining many of the elements that hardcore fans will eat up. Make no mistake about this, this is not your old G1 Transformers, but at the same time, it manages to pay homage to it in many ways that will make you smile.A burning question in your mind is how is the CGI? To put it as clearly as possible, they are gorgeous. Taking into account that Transformers, when compared to other action focused blockbusters such as Spider-man 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean, it had roughly half the budget, which makes Michael Bay's use of the CGI even more stunning. The CGI makes the Transformers come to life in this movie, complete with moving parts made even more amazing by the almost seamless interaction between themselves and humans. At times, you can really believe that the Transformers are really interacting with human beings. Perhaps one of the most stunning features of the CGI is the believable transformation sequences, which gets rid of the goofy inconsistency from the original film in which the Transformers could change into something that is drastically smaller than their robot forms. Now you can almost see how the Transformers change into a vehicle and back to their robot form piece by piece. The only unfortunate part of the visuals is that at times it appears that budget constraints were hidden through shaky and limited camera views of the Transformers. Luckily, for the most part, you don't notice this, and at times it even creates an exciting scene.What would these Transformers be without actors, including a competent voice cast? To put it clearly, it would be one drab movie. Thankfully, Transformers manages to have a great cast of both human actors and a brilliant voice cast. The main character, Sam (played by Shia Labeouf), is a surprisingly interesting character that we actually have fun getting to know. Labeouf really adds to the magic of this movie by his interaction, not only with other human characters but also with the Transformers that he interacts with in a believable and engaging way.Onto the Autobots and Decepticons. All I can say about them is that I was very impressed, but yet disappointed at the same time. Peter Cullen does an amazing job as Optimus, and the emotion you get from his voice work is top notch and I cannot imagine anyone doing it any better. The other Autobots had great voice castings, but sadly, they were underutilized and did not say much (though when they did it was usually good!). On the Decepticon side, Megatron and Frenzy did most of the speaking (Frenzy spoke in another language), with little dialog coming from everyone else. For those that were worried about Megatron's voice, don't be, because the voice fits perfectly with his new, almost frightening look and it plays well off of Peter Cullen. It is just too bad that he did not have more lines.Enough with the behind the scenes things like CGI and talent, what was the movie like? This movie is a thrill ride from beginning to end, and I can almost guarantee that there will be a moment where you will go ""Whoa"" (hopefully in a more dramatic voice than Neo in the Matrix). Michael Bay has crafted some of the most spectacular action scenes of all time, and shows that he has the artistic talent it takes when it comes to action, with some action sequences never before seen on the big screen. In fact, there is so much going on that you will miss some of it and you will probably have to go see the movie again. The robot battles are epic for the most part (despite a disappointing Megatron vs. Optimus final battle), and your adrenaline will be pumping, to say the least. To help provide some much needed change of pace, the movie has its share of humor, some of which is low brow, but at the same time it provides a fun laugh. What makes the movie so good is that it never takes itself too seriously, yet at the same time it manages to suck you into things with the visuals.This movie is one of the best action movies around and it is truly a great movie within the genre. This is due to a combination of characters, expertly shot action sequences, CGI, humorous dialog, and a roller-coaster ride when it comes to emotions. Hardcore fans of Transformers will find enough familiarities with the movie that they should appreciate it, while new fans will find an experience like no other one out there. This is a cartoon to movie adaptation done right, and Michael Bay should be applauded for accomplishing this. Transformers was not easy to adapt without getting into the realm of B movie territory, or on the flip side, making it into something that definitely is not Transformers. He managed to find a fine balance between these two sides of the fence and created a thrill ride that sucks the audience in and won't let go. I have no doubt the cheers I heard at the end of this film is not limited to my area. But that is true that for most who see this movie and are looking for a movie that is well made and above all else, fun. So make plans to see this film and ROLL OUT to your local movie theater right away!","Jul 12, 2007",10,/10
"I grew up with the Transformers and find the whole ""diehard"" nitpicking a bit ridiculous. The original cartoon was meant to be a tie-in to sell more toys, nothing more nothing less. Given that fact, all this pseudo gravitas created by the rabid following is funny to watch and listen to. If you take your Transformers THAT serious, stay home because this movie strives for nothing more than what we got with the early 80's cartoons.Effects are spectacular, explosions and action are top notch. But then again, that is no surprise, this is a Michael Bay movie. People really need to get off the hate Bay band-wagon and just understand and know summer means getting the blazes away from the real world and stepping into a cooled theater and enjoying some fun. Bay knows how to do that in spades and gives it to us here.The story is weak, holes through and through, but so what. The film succeeds in giving us exactly what we want from a Transformer film: robot's in action! If you have created some sort of alternate reality world where Transformers is about something more, again, stay home. There is comedic moment sprinkled all through the action. That does remove a sense of danger from the film, but then again, this wasn't supposed to be a rated R fest.My only disappointment with the film is the score. Normally with a Bay production we get a great anthem of score music. There really isn't much in the way of that in the film. We get some coolly placed rock music, but the score never really reaches out and grabs you. I had hoped for a variation on the Transformer theme, but what we get is a by the numbers score.This is another solid effort from Bay. A good way to get out of the heat of the summer and enjoy some fun.","Jul 6, 2007",7,/10
"Marvelous! Michael Bay and the entire special effects team - I am awed by Transformers. The CGI/special effects of this film are unsurpassed by a film of today. Kudos for a job well done! For starters, I have never watched the TV show, so I cannot compare the movie to what came before it. I just know a great movie when I see one, and this one is unequaled. The plot is respectable, the actors fit the parts, the film is fast paced, filled with action, and the humor is supreme.... I could go on and on, but if you want to be completely entertained, go to the theater now and see this film.There's only one thing not to love about this movie- the bad guys. LOL Who wants to love them anyway? We love to hate them, and this is exactly how you'll feel.Did I mention the special effects? Seriously, you will be blown away. I could have gone back into the theater and re-watched this film once again today just to see the special effects.I simply must own this on DVD. What's the release date? : )","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10
"when you think about what to expect walking into a movie like transformers, its basically what you get. There's no fancy dialogue or complex story lines, its just a fun movie with lots of action. The battle scenes are very cool and well done, and every time you see a Transformer move and fight, its a sight to be had.There is mild humor throughout the movie that seems to fit right in at the right point. Not sloppily done. The special effects of course are great and very exciting, i'm not sure if it was released in i-max but it should be. Im sure kids will love this movie, and it will become an instant kid classic.So when your thinking about a good movie to go out and see with your 12 or 13 year old child, this movie is perfect. Its lots of fun and it has lots of action. A nice little flavor blast for a worn out movie goer.7 from me.","Jul 7, 2007",7,/10

"I caught this movie on the 4th of July. I will definitely be waiting anxiously for it to come out on DVD to add it to my collection. I was thoroughly impressed with this film. They did a wonderful job of keeping it true to the cartoon incarnation while still giving it the modern feel and making it enjoyable for more than just the generation of us who used to watch it when we were young. I was blown away that it seemed to be over so fast. It did not feel like 2½ hours. I almost hope they don't do a sequel because they will have a very difficult time making it better than this one was. There are very few movies that I have seen that were able to give me goosebumps as many times as this one did, not out of fear but out of awe. This movie brought to life one of my favorite childhood memories in a way I could never have imagined myself.","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10

"The movie was better then I expected it to be. It showed why it's worth turning some cartoons into live action films. I thought it was a nice touch that they used the same voice for Optimus Prime, as I remember when I was a kid. I can't put my finger on it, but it was missing something? The fx were fantastic, and the pace was fast, but it was alittle thick on the jokes made by human reaction, to seeing the Transformers for the first time. It was like watching the reaction Godzilla would get, but one to many times. The relationship between the lead character and his car was alittle less caring then it should have been. The movie was however, a great way to set up a second film etc. I think Transformers will be a great franchise, now that the introductions to humanity are out of the way, and we can get to the actual stories. The battle scene between Prime, and Megatron didn't lack any action, but it did lack the emotion, there battles showed on the cartoon. All that said, it is worth a view. Maybe not waiting in line, but surly worth the 140 odd minutes.","Jul 6, 2007",7,/10
"The movie was absolutely amazing. I've been a long time fan of Transformers and I have been waiting so long for a motion picture of the series to come out. At first I thought that the movie would be a disappointment. I mean, how can the transforming and detail of the fight scenes and autobots/decepticons be replicated? After watching it, I was completely blown away. The cinematography and effects were flawless. I really enjoyed the plot line and Labeouf/Fox were a great on - screen pair.I am eager to see that the next two movies have the Dinobots. I don't think any new characters that were never in the series should be added, thought. It would be better to keep all the original characters.The small bits of comedy and romance are great too. Not too much of everything. The action is was FANTASTIC. The detail in how the transformations from machine to robot was so cool. Overall, this movie was THE BEST that I have ever seen in my life. Definitely on my top ten.I choose to Protect rather than Destroy. I choose the Autobots rather than the Decepticons. I want Jazz to be repaired in the second movie...LOL. Michael Bay should stay on the roster. He was great.See you in Transformers 2, Optimus Prime Bumblebee Jazz Ratchet Ironhide.","Jul 18, 2007",10,/10
"I watched Transformer yesterday (I am Swiss Italian and the movie opened here as world-premiere in Australia and Italy on Thursday, June 28th).The movie totally blew me away from the beginning to the end. There wasn't a moment where I felt bored (and hey, that's not easy for a 144' movie!). First of all I can easily say Transformers in one of the best movie of Michael Bay (among them I put The Rock, Bad Boys 2 and The Island).Not only action scenes are stunning but Bay also shows he can add first-rate humor to more quiet moments and dialogue sequences.You'll never look to a car or a truck the same way you did before after watching Transformers.Transformers will be a cult movie, that's for sure. My best scene? There is one moment in the movie which glorificate Cinema and made me feel exalted: toward the end, during the city battle, when one Autobot jumps in slow-motion over a screaming woman to avoid collision with some guided missiles: you can also hear great background music of Steve Jablonsky. That was awesome!!I am not a kid anymore but this movie really makes me feel happy and gratified. Ado","Jun 30, 2007",7,/10
"It is no doubt the best movie of year 2007. Maybe it is a bit subjective to draw a conclusion like this, but as a TF mania I was really shocked when I saw my dream of childhood was realized on the screen. Though I own some delicate TF toys but it was really a different feeling to see them speaking moving and fighting like human being. The Optimus Prime in this movie was so cute that I am now considering that the figure of OP in 80's cartoon was a little countrified. Thank you Michael Bay and thank you Stephen Spielberg, you did not let me down after anxiety waiting of more than one year. Now the only thing for me to do is just waiting for the coming of it's DVD set.","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10

"I cannot understand how IMDb could give Transformers an 8.2 rating. Sorry, but this movie does not deserve that kind of credit. When I went to see the movie on July 4, I was not expecting to set eyes upon a freakish mess of bad acting, boring CGI, AND ridiculously laughable dialog. Transformers is a perfect example of what not to do while making a movie. I must say, Michael Bay has absolutely no artistic eye whatsoever, and it sickens me to think that a preschooler fan of Transformers could have just as well pieced this pile of crap together. Also, the voice acting of the Transformers was abysmal, and the dialog was cheesy. In some of the scenes, I just sat in my chair--staring at the screen in disbelief. This may have been one of the worst films I have ever viewed. Because the camera angles and filming is so jerky throughout the entire movie, not only was I confused, but I thought I would start experiencing photosensitive seizures! My advice: do not listen to any of the good reviews on this piece of sh*t. I you're gonna see it, wait till it comes out on DVD. Even then, you'll find it to be a waste of money and time.","Jul 8, 2007",1,/10
"Transformers is a walk down nostalgia lane for some of the 20-30 Generation who grew up when these toys exploded onto the market. Now, decades later, the series has come back again in real time.And it has been worth the wait.The plot basically revolves around a boy and a girl who buys a Camaro unbeknowst that it has in fact got the ability to turn into a robot. The robot, Bumblebee, protects them as the boy holds the key to finding the Allspark, a powerful energy source that the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, want. Unfortunately, there are others who want it too, namely the evil Decipticons, led by Megatron, who begin to pursue, wiping out lots of Earth's communication in order to prepare for a full-scale assault.The plot is not original by any means of the imagination, and parallels can be seen with a lot of other Michael Bay films, particularly in the build up. However the transformers are simply awesome. The effects are truly incredible and you really get caught up as you see the Autobots 'roll out', or the Decepticons lay waste to, well basically everything. The script also manages to fill in a good sense of humour which is sometimes a little hit-and-miss but all the same it's there.This is a truly cool movie, with some great lines and some awesome special effects that are perhaps the most stunning since Jurassic Park wowed us a decade ago. With two sequels to go, I just hope they can keep it up.","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10
"Director Michael Bay will never win any awards for subtlety with his industrial-strength, testosterone-heavy popcorn movies. His prevalent use of quick cuts and hand-held shots, compounded by car chases, explosions and other CGI-saturated effects, are all accounted for in this juvenile-oriented 2007 action picture, but I have to admit that there is a welcome sense of humor in the screenplay by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci that manages to bring this one a cut above Bay's previous endeavors like The Island. Humor is a smart approach in tackling potentially unfamiliar terrain such as Hasbro's Transformers franchise, which had its heyday in the 1980's, before much of the film's audience was born. Yet, at the same time, there is a need to remain true to the spirit of the original premise without changing it in order to pacify baby boomers who would not accept anything less than the myth. In meeting both those objectives, the film meets expectations as an intermittently entertaining summer film.The convoluted story has to do with two warring factions of shape-changing robots - the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons - who both depend on a monolithic entity known as the Cube for sustaining their races. Just how it does it is beyond my comprehension, as do most of the plot details having to do with the Transformers and their planet Cybertron. What make marginally more sense is the main storyline around an awkward, huckstering teenager named Sam Witwicky, who is the descendant of an explorer whose glasses hold the key to the Cube. Sam wants a car badly and gets a beat-up Camaro which naturally turns out to be an Autobot. He also wants Mikaela, a girl who seems way out of his league until her mechanical skills and checkered past come to the fore. While this boy-meets-car-and-girl story is simmering, there are other subplots involving an army unit in the Middle East battling the Decepticons, a computer hacker who frustrates the Secretary of Defense with her complex yet undeniable deductive reasoning, and a group of X-Files-type agents, led by an overbearing zealot, who try to take Sam and Mikaela into custody.There doesn't seem to be great priority placed on resolving the various plot lines, except for the first one and only after twenty minutes of quick-action destruction held mostly in medium shots in an assumed attempt to exaggerate the parameters of the action. Oddly, the climax has more of a benumbing effect since it's difficult to tell the scope of the action with much of it feeling clunky and repetitive until the exhausting finish. Before that, many scenes come across as inexplicable, over-explained or just too drawn out to enjoy fully, for example, the comically clumsy Autobots hiding around Sam's parents' house. Emphasizing the derivative nature of Bay's approach here are snatches of film classics like The Terminator and especially King Kong used throughout, and the influence of executive producer Steven Spielberg can be felt in Sam's responsibility-driven storyline.Bay and the screenwriters deserve credit for humanizing the robots just enough to make them compelling to the viewer, though honestly not enough to empathize that much with their fates. It's not for lack of trying, as for example, Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus Prime, provides stentorian fervor and palpable dignity to the role. The human performances are in line with a comic-book-style franchise. Shia LaBeouf has the most screen time as Sam. The young actor makes Sam a likable reluctant hero, though he's fairly limited beyond his constant look of amazement. The real scene stealers are John Turturro as the unctuous agent, Anthony Anderson as a squealing hacker and recent Tony winner Julie White as Sam's overprotective mother. Barely registering is Josh Duhamel as the heroic head of the army unit and Megan Fox in form-fitting wear as Mikaela. All in all, it's pretty clear that the movie defies logic and relies heavily on sensory overload to sustain itself. The unexpected comedy elements are what make it better than at least what I expected.","Aug 2, 2007",6,/10
"For some Michael Bay can do no wrong. For others, he's the anti-Christ in cinema today. I'm nowhere near the former, though maybe not exactly the latter either. He does what he does and his films make money (with the exception of the Island, ironically since that film is somewhat more watchable than most). So he's a safe bet for the studios to do what he does, which are big, noisy, shiny, and completely empty-headed popcorn action pictures where the special effects triumph overwhelmingly over any human presence. This has never been more relevant a criticism than in Transformers, even if it might not an abomination like Pearl Harbor, or like Armageddon where its awfulness dawns on the viewer after a first somehow impressive viewing.Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I wasn't a ""fan"" of the transformers by much when I was a kid (which, of course, is the best time to become a fan- they're cars that turn into fighting alien robots after all), and never watched the animated movie. So it wasn't a priority to seek out a film version directed by Michael Bay. After finally seeing the movie, it's a reasonable conclusion that it has either found its audience or never will. For those who might love a big, clunky, overlong and densely-plotted flick where the humans are given dumb-ass dialog in lieu of overpowering visual/special FX that moves at the speed of delirious light, it hits the nail on the head. For those who want, er, substance, look elsewhere. It's a film based upon a *toyline*, after all.So, saying that it *is* empty-headed and silly may almost be a plus for some. And, in a sense, for Bay this has now become his forte. And indeed, needless to say, when one turns off their logic centers of the cerebral cortex and tries the 'go-with-the-flow' nature of the action sequences, of those giant alien robots fighting ridiculously with other robots all over some cube, it almost is kind of fun. Almost. But as soon as one is stuck with the human beings, characters like Shia Labouf's character, it's a little torturous when it's clear that Bay can't direct actors (it's not that Labouf is even not talented, as evidenced in the latest Indiana Jones picture). And there are a lot of scenes with these silly humans, far more silly than those with the robots, who work on a guilty pleasure level of excitement even for a viewer as reluctant to appreciate the finer nature of the movie's appeal.Here's the bottom line, folks. It's a huge fantasy movie that has no real discernible plot, that often invokes ""the world wide web"" and ""ebay"" like they're sacred objects. It relies on dialog that any other filmmaker (well, maybe not Spielberg, who produced the movie) would find mostly laughable. It's cinematography is shiny, like an overpriced Christmas tree. It's got hot new young talents like Megan Fox, used mostly for eye candy. And Bay even tries to throw in ""real"" actors, like Jon Voight and, for a few cool moments, John Tuturro. And the work put into designing the robots by the VFX animators is commendable. Transformers, for me, isn't a total disaster, but a sign of the times, of marketing and packaging for a young and seemingly hungry crowd for loud, stupid action to lumber along at a frantic, uneven pace. In short, it's Michael Bay, as clear as alien-robot-transformer crystals.","Jun 10, 2008",4,/10
"Okay, that was kinda lame...Anywho, in my particular tradition of knowing that you already know what the movie is about I will spare you all yet another long and drawn out rehashing of what the movie was about and tell you all what I thought...Besides, that's what the plot/synopsis link is for...Moving on... I liked it... I liked a lot to tell you the truth.Many people knock Michael Bay. I really don't understand why. Before I even knew who Bay was, I have enjoyed his movies...See, when it comes to taking a cartoon and/or comic book and making it into a large scale movie there is a little thing that takes place called dramatic license. Way to many fan boys simply can't comprehend it, and usually whine about stupid things like ""Oh Megatron didn't look like Megatron"", or ""Soundwave didn't look like Soundwave"", or ""There was no All-Spark"", or ""Bumble-Bee wasn't a Camaro, and was a yellow bug instead"", and let's not forget ""it didn't even sound like Starscream"", or how about ""Devestator wasn't a tank, he was a Constructacon"".Yeah, well robots don't bend like the do in cartoons either...Some dramatic license can be bad, like the debacle that was Spider-Man III, but don't get me started on that one... At least not here...Either way, to answer all those gripes, Megatron would have looked absolutely ridiculous as a handgun/cannon. When was the last time you actually saw/owned a boom box? The all spark didn't replace energon, it was something entirely different, and you have to admit a Volkswagen bug, at least in this case, has no menacing bad @$$ qualities as say a Chevy Camaro...Although they did kinda over do the whole GMC plug...A whiny tenor voiced Starscream would have been annoying in five minutes, and as far as Devesator went, well if you are really so upset over that then there really isn't much that can be said that isn't painfully obvious...Okay, so how was the movie? The movie was good. It was of course action packed. Eye Candy GALORE! But then again for this type of movie, you don't really go for deep meaningful character development, or in depth philosophical enlightenment...That's like going to see Star Wars for the dialog. No one in their right mind would want to see Star Wars for the god-awful dialogue that Lucas somehow managed to cobble together. You go because you want to see epic Light Saber Battles. Same difference here.We want to see massive robots kicking the tar out of each other, making that cool ""eh ah oo"" sound that they make when they transform.At times the camera's were a little too in your face. A little too fast perhaps as well. At times it was somewhat hard to comprehend the action; you knew it was going on, but at the same time it looked jumbled and messy.Another critique I have, and this is going to sound odd, is the choice of voicing for Optimus Prime. I know, I know, using Peter Cullen because he was the original was like a dream of dampness to many, but at the same time Optimus sounded a bit old, and understandably so. I personally felt that Hugo Weaving who voiced Megatron would have sounded perfect for this Optimus Prime. But that's just me.Megatron, in this movie almost acted, sounded, and just a little bit even looked more like Galvatron then anything else... Which was kinda cool.Which in that case, what they could've done would have been to call up Leonard Nimoy (who still has a great voice, and sounds much as he did when he voiced Galvatron) and had him voice Megatron and have Hugo Weaving do Optimus. At least that way the bad guy would be gravely and hard while the good guy would be a bit more smoother... But again, nothing that would make me change my opinion of the film...In the end, it was a pretty cool movie with lot's of pretty colors, and well done cgi, (and maybe perhaps some left over Episode One sound effects). Had a simple to the point story, and left me with happy thoughts......doom doom dooooom the end...October 21, 2007*The DVD Review*So ""x"" amount of time has passed and the movie that was in theaters in now finally on film. i, having enjoyed this enough to actually buy it on DVD, decided that perhaps it would be an interesting thing to write about any other thoughts that may have come up in my second viewing of this film.Movies often times seem different the second time around.My general reaction is still pretty much the same. it's a pretty good flick. the gmc plugging was just as annoying, and the movies effects and action sequences were more then enough for me to forget about it.I made a comment above that i would like to retract however, and that was about optimus prime sounding a bit too old. in my second viewing of this film i found nothing that sounded dated whatsoever. peter Cullen was a good choice to rehash optimus. i still think that they could have easily gotten away with using Leonard nimoy as mega tron, but perhaps that will be something for the sequels...One last thing that i can say before i sign off, is that the choice of music was too distracting. battle for honor and humanity, by tomoyasu hotei (i think i spelled that right, but just in case the ""kill bill"" theme), and the linkin park end song are simply to popular to be used effectively for a movie. soundtracks ought to have original music for the movie, or at the very least music that isn't all that popular.","Jul 11, 2007",9,/10
"""Independence Day"" meets ""Terminator"".Seriously Director Michael Bay delivers a high-caliber, catastrophic action movie of man and machine. Like most action movies attempting to cover so much ground, there are issues the dialogue can be aloof, character development is minimal, and the world of suspended disbelief eventually begins to unravel. But with so much stellar action, this is entirely forgivable. Plus a cast of welcome familiars lead by rising star Shia ""Even Stevens"" LaBeouf and supported by Jon ""Midnight Cowboy"" Voight, Bernie ""Mr. 3000"" Mac, and John ""Don't F*ck with the Jesus"" Turturro.www.manwithavan.blogspot.com","Nov 20, 2007",,

"Transformers is simply amazing. It is entertaining, fun, and the special effects are mind-blowing, even for this age when people take them for granted in every movie.Of course, all the critics would find many reasons why this film would be bad. They always do that. Regardless, people like it, and that is the main thing. Unlike some other animation/comics-based films, Transformers actually leave the old shell behind and focuses more on making a good entertainment rather than satisfying the die-hard fan's desires for boxy, classic characters. The pacing and editing is also unusual for this kind of movies, resulting in a very realistic environment.Shia LaBoeuf is simply great as the main character, and stands out the most, whilst Megan Fox, playing the role of protagonist's dream girl, is only trying to look hot instead of acting, sometimes making me wonder if anybody would notice the difference if a poster would be put in her place with voice-over. Her lines are pathetic, but a good (or any) actor talent should have dealt with that. She just doesn't have it.Overall, a great entertainment. I was very satisfied. This wouldn't have worked without Michael Bay, which made the movie into something more than one would expect from just hearing the name. 9.5/10==================================================================== ==================================================================== ====================================================================After a rewatch 08/07/17' of revisiting this first Transformers after watching Age of Extinction, this film stacks up and looks a lot better in comparison. Overall, this film isn't technical on a story and plot scale but it does entertain, and the run time doesn't feel as overly long since it is an enjoyment. Rated a 9 in comparison to the other Transformers film as one feels this is the clear cut best film of the franchise. It is a shame how far the franchise has came since this film 10 years ago. Where as now that the Transformers franchise has had 5 films, many people today are revisiting this film and tending to like it more due to nostalgia and the current state of the series with Mark Wahlberg. Where as back when this was released, it received a lot of backlash from critics and some fans but now it is considered 'great/enjoyable' and people are missing Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox.","Aug 8, 2010",9,/10
"There are a number of good things about Transformers the movie. Good special effects, some funny dialog, and mostly good acting from the cast. Unfortunately there is so much product placement it nearly ruins what would otherwise be a decent summer blockbuster.The biggest violation of all is that they changed most of the autobots from the original forms. Why does this happen? Because the movie was sponsored by GM. So forget seeing Bumblebee as a VW, and forget Jazz being a Porsche. Now instead you have a new Camaro and Solstice respectively. A freakin Solstice! The product placement doesn't stop there either. Many scenes will have a giant billboards behind them, and sometimes someone will just blurt out a product name.That being said, there are some positives. The special effects for instance were quite good, although sometimes it's hard to tell what's happening. Most of the actors put in pretty good performances as well, with Shia LaBeouf being the stand out. Megan Fox is also pretty easy to look at, and she puts in a solid effort so no harm done there. John Voight on the other hand is border-line terrible as the secretary of defense, but he was probably just getting paid. He was WAY better in Zoolander.So if you are 14, have low expectations, are a big fat comic book nerd, or you just want to see cool robots with lots of stuff blowing up, then you'll find a lot to like in Transformers.Otherwise with so much blatant product placement it's hard movie to recommend.Lastly I need a final WTF! for the absence of Thundercracker and Skywarp. Oh well I'm sure they will be in the sequel.","Jul 5, 2007",6,/10

"The ""Transformers"" concept is of course Japanese, but the origin predates the animated television show that originally aired in the U. S. from 1984 to 1987. The idea actually goes back to the post WWII ""Godzilla"" series. The Japanese were able to turn the big green fellow into a franchise by producing a series of sequels with titles like: ""Godzilla vs ???"" (Mothra, Biallante, Cosmic Monster, King Ghidorah, Magalon, The Smog Monster, etc. etc.). Japanese producers had discovered a universal appeal in combat between a somewhat good monster/ alien and a clearly bad one. Arnold the Barbarian's ""Terminator"" sequels also picked up on this can't miss idea.Director Michael Bay has latched onto this idea as a way to arrest his career decline. Normally repeated disasters on the scale of ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Armageddon"" would result in banishment from Hollywood and a subsequent career making educational films in Des Moines. But somehow Bay was able to convince them to use him for this project. Apparently having crashed and burned (spectacularly) in many of his prior efforts, gave Bay a fair degree of perspective and he is able to have a lot of self-reflexive fun with ""Transformers""; a goofy film with a lot of stuff that blows up it neat ways and does not take itself nearly as seriously as the original series. In fact it should appeal to ""Godziilla"" fans who find this quasi-parody quality endearing. In place of Godzilla and Mothra et al the film features Computer Generated Transformer toys that contort and expand from something normal into robot monsters. The head monster, who speaks with the voice of Earthquake McGoon, is a bad boy named Megatron. He is the most fearsome of the evil Decepticons robots, who are at odds with the nice robots (Transformers). Both brands of robots fled the doomed planet Cybertron and came to Earth. There is a fairly explicit reason for their choosing Earth (called the Allspark) but for it is not important that casual viewers fully understand the details. Initially ""Transformers"" is a teen movie, with the familiar loser teen boy (Sam played by Shia LaBeouf) lusting after the hot girl (Mikaela-not the one on ""Star Search"" but Megan Fox who played snobby Carla in ""Confessions of Teenage Drama Queen"") who does not know that he exists. Fox has aged noticeably since ""Drama Queen"" and is fading uncomfortably fast, but she still looks good enough that scorching your eyeballs is a real possibility.In an attempt of improve Sam's social standing at school (and to advance the storyline), his Dad gets him a Camaro which turns out to be a Transformer named Bumblebee. Having a transforming car causes Mikaela to notice Sam at about the time the film itself transforms from teen movie to battling robot Sci-Fi. Enter the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight) , the armed forces or at least Sgt. Lennox (John Duhamel) and Tech Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and a secret agent (Coen Brothers favorite John Turturro). Like the ""Godzilla"" franchise the best efforts of the military make little impression on the robot monsters. Bay builds up the suspense level as things move toward an epic battle between the Transformers and the Decepticons that will decide the fate of the world. Unfortunately the wheels start to fall off the film at this point as it goes into the ""exercise in excess"" mode of stuff like ""Ultraviolet"" and King Kong"". The Industrial Light and Magic effects are not at fault as their digital creations are first class. There is plenty of attention to detail and the movements and battle sequences are individually excellent. The problem is that the whole is considerably less than the sum of its parts. A situation that is only tolerable if you begin viewing things from the self-parody angle; which I think was actually Bay's intention all along. As Roger Ebbert notes: ""The mechanical battle goes on and on and on and on, with robots banging into each other and crashing into buildings, and buildings falling into the street, and the military firing, and jets sweeping overhead, and Megatron and the good hero, Optimus Prime, duking it out, and the soundtrack sawing away at thrilling music, and enough is enough.""It's really time for these CGI dominated movies to mature and start choreographing their scenes to be more than just eye candy. A logical fight strategy would be nice, something that makes sense and is not just random violence. The ""Transformers"" violence looks like it was lifted from old scripted bouts of ""Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling""; with the combatants often down but never out. The failure to incorporate logic distances the audience from the action and makes it impossible to build any real suspense. For this reason alone, the film would have benefited from some serious action scene trimming and a more logical assembly in the editing room. Computer animation has become far cheaper than actually staging live-action sequences but audiences are increasingly discounting these scenes-viewer thrills don't happen when viewers are wise enough to see it as animation. Current audiences are finding it increasingly difficult to suspend disbelief. The same thing occurred in the 1960's when audiences began recognizing the projected backgrounds used for scenes shot in the studio. This started a trend toward shooting films on location with only television shows still using the sound stages. But this excess is the film's only real fault and since it comes at the end most of the viewing experience is quite enjoyable. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.","Jul 15, 2007",7,/10
"I recently read a comment here on IMDb that said this movie is in no way meant for kids and that everyone should see it no matter how old they are. For example, another guy said: When I saw the trailer of the film I thought that Transformers was going to be another silly action movie without a story but I was wrong. Oh, God! He was wrong! And I was dumb enough to fall for this. IT IS A SILLY ACTION MOVIE WITHOUT A STORY! Let's make one thing clear. I have nothing against cartoons turn blockbusters. But this is something completely different. Apart from good FX that bore you to death after so many repetitions, this flick is a mindless showcase of bad script, horrible acting and stumping plot which glorifies US Army and supposedly gang-ho government keen on keeping top secrets for the benefit of the nation. From scene one you wish the main character dies a horrifying death and you imagine him ending up in Hostel 3, but unfortunately this is not a torture-porn or a slasher where you can hope someone would perform medieval on his a*s. This aggravating actor who, by the way, carbon copied his role in Disturbia, then finds himself a peer in a pretentious, ""popular"", vain high-school girl who keeps delivering lines of a four year old and at one point agrees to sit in his lap because he said he has the only seatbelt and safety comes first. And yet, she tells him he's a smooth talker!? Are American girls really that stupid or is it what Hollywood want them to be? Shia is one bad actor who repeats himself and have seen too many sitcoms as a kid, and his acting is made even worse by lame directing. You even find yourself embarrassed by his acting. The two then make a hero couple who start getting on your nerves and every moment you wish these two wannabe actors at least get squashed by a giant robot's foot and get it over with. Except the ticket price, there is absolutely nothing here that will keep you in your seat throughout this video/audio torture, for the CGI FX are pointless if your intelligence is being constantly insulted by this no-brainer. The small Decepticons mumble like Gremlins or spiders in Eight legged freaks, which is totally inappropriate sound effect for a robot, as it is for a spider. I don't know which car company sponsored this disaster, maybe all of them did, along with eBay and US Army, but I found that TV commercial with the same robot-to-car transformation much more entertaining and fulfilling. I know Jon Voight sank low lately, but John Turturro was one of my favorite character actors. I just hope this extremely high rating is not a result of a mass voting by dumbed-down adults who suffered an incurable brain damage, but by neglected kids poisoned and brainwashed by anime. This should be banned for people over 10 outside Japan.","Nov 2, 2007",1,/10

"I happened to watch this film on China's release date, but the mandarine dubbed version appears to be cheesy, most of time I could not distinguish the talking between Autorots and Decepticon...Fortunately they didn't talk too much! Plot is simple and easier to follow, anyhow special effects are really the CPU of this movie.Actually I'd rather to say it is largely a value-added product origin ed from its primary comics. It's a good idea to bring humen with these E.T. robots together, as a good complement to original ones.Another good thing is it is a zero-violence and zero-sex film for general audience, so that Chinese film bureau wouldn't censor any part of this film, so that we can watch this film in full-length, Viva La~ I give it 7 out of 10, and it is largely due to its special effects, not plot though.","Jul 11, 2007",7,/10
"There seems to be only two ways to go with 'Transformers'- either you hate the film, or you love it. I happen to hate it. With a vengeance. I suppose it's because the film COULD have been so much more. We have a decent, blockbuster idea- giant robots bent on destroying the world- and we also have... there is also... huh. That's all. But anyway, if all the other things were better, like the clunky screenplay, the mindless direction, and the never-more-annoying Shia, this COULD have gone somewhere. The biggest problem I have with the film is that it has no brain. It is just one big explosion/sound effect/giant ILM robot after the next. I like big action sequences as much as the next person, but not all the way through a 144 minute film. The actual 'Transformers' are quite hard to tell apart. Director Michael Bay obviously thought that all the visual effects would distract us from what the screenwriter hoped we would think is a plot. (Ooo! Shiny!)The humor relies heavily on cheap jokes. The first is when Sam gets his pants pulled off of him by a robot. Anticipated audience reaction: HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!!! LOOK!!! BOXERS! Another scene is when the kid is being chased by his car and takes off down the street on his mom's bike, which is pink. Anticipated audience reaction: He's a guy, and- get this- he's riding on a PINK BIKE!!! Oh, the HILARITY! My sides are splitting! Oh, STOP!!! PLEASE!! NO MORE!!!!There are also quite a few crude jokes in this film that just don't seem to fit. One of the transformers pees on a human. Note to whoever came up with that: Having a transformer pee on a human does not heighten our level of respect or fear of said transformer.All in all, this is a film with minimal story, head-pounding action sequences and stupid jokes. If you REALLY want to see this film, I recommend watching it late at night with the sound turned right down. Don't try and follow the story because there isn't one. Just sit back and play with your iPhone until the effects/explosions come on.","Sep 29, 2009",1,/10
"After the ultimate failure with the dub of the so called ""Unicron Trilogy"" (Armada, Energon & Cybertron) it looked like that Transformers was going downhill completely. But...Our darkest hour had come to light ^_^ I heard at around late 2003 that there were plans to make a live action movie of the Transformers, at first it was considered a rumour around some time in 2004 but thankfully...It happened.After waiting for several few years of waiting for a Movie of TF's to be made, watching trailers and TV spots and waiting and waiting for the movie to hit the big screen. Finally in 2007, the movie came! I was just speechless at what I saw...it was a freakin masterpiece and brought back the true spirit of the Transformers into this epic movie! Also, with much pleading from the fans, Peter Cullen (The voice of Generation one Optimus Prime) came back to play the role of Optimus prime which saved this movie from completely going down the toilet.Still, there were some problems that die-hard TF fans had problems coping with. The designs were kinda more alien and some people hated them, mainly Megatron's design...Never the less, the film pretty much got people loving and hating it.Myself I loved it! Wonderful acting from both Machine and human (Even though the humans pretty much dominated the roles of the TFs in this movie) Dare I say it, Thank you Micheal Bay for making all this possible, Perhaps you don't suck being a director after all.Bottom line...Great, Fantastic, Wonderful Movie! a real treat for Transformers fans and even on those who are getting started on Transformers!

"This film is the fight between two gangs of robotic creatures for the mysterious energy reserve called The Cube.The special effects are so amazing. Action happens so fast that it is almost impossible to keep up with everything that happens. The transformation of robots is so seamless and realistic. It is such an impressive job to have several robots transforming on a busy street, with the army shooting at them and people escaping in all directions. Apart from the visual feast, the story has a human touch as well, as shown by the emotions of robots. It has a gripping story, and it unfolds little by little at the right pace. This film simply redefines what a mega-budget blockbuster looks like.","Aug 6, 2007",,
"Michael Bay is by no means a director for whom I anticipate each movie of his. The man doesn't do subtlety and he doesn't do intelligent storytelling either. However, you cannot say he doesn't have both artistic vision and deft skill at shooting a film. Sure the guy likes to blow things up, but being able to consistently make work with the amount of preparation and choreography that is necessary, the guy needs some credit. When the idea of a live action Transformers movie was being bandied about with Steven Spielberg's name attached, I will admit I was intrigued while also perplexed by the directing choice. It was only when Spielberg went to the producing side and brought Bay on to helm the action that I finally started to get excited. I knew absolutely nothing about the mythology besides remembering that the toys were cool, but something about Bay, whom I will admit to not being the biggest fan of, just seemed the right fit. After finally experiencing the phenomenon, I will say that I don't think anyone could have done it better, even if the film itself could have been elevated a tad higher.Truthfully, no one is going to see this movie with the hopes of watching a wonderfully written script and emotional progression leading to a top-notch conclusion that both satisfies and ignites conversation. Come on, this is a story about aliens coming to Earth for their ""lifespark"" in order to take over the universe. You've got the Decepticons led by Megatron looking to destroy and you have Optimus Prime's Autobots attempting to thwart their attempts. This is all about the effects and the carnage with the slight story playing second fiddle only to allow for more explosions. On this level, the film is very successful and a great time at the theatre. You can't ask for better special effects or fight scenes. The ""transforming"" is just awesome to behold and never gets tired as the film goes on, the integration of robots with humans is quite flawless, and the animation bringing the two worlds together is pop art at its best.The real stars here are the Transformers themselves and you really can't fault anything about them. With that said, this movie doesn't happen without its multitude of humans to play off of. For the most part they do an admirable job in keeping the audience's interest enough to not mind waiting until the next big effects sequence happens. Shia LaBeouf uses his sarcastic, nice guy persona to good use like always. I believe he just plays himself in most things, but even if he does, it works. Surprisingly I was impressed by Josh Duhamel who I really look upon as not an actor, but his small role is effectively played, as well as his army compatriot portrayed by the underrated Tyrese Gibson. Heck even Megan Fox manages to be a little more than just eye candy and Jon Voight entertains once you get past the horrid Southern accent.Where the film fails for me is in the campy overtones and corny jokes sprinkled in everywhere. I understand the fight scenes are so big and serious that Bay and company felt they needed some levity to counteract them, but really now. Some of these jokes are so bad and some of these characters are so one-dimensionally hammy that I was shaking my head hoping they would be crushed during the fights. I love both Anthony Anderson and John Turturro, but here they are utterly terrible. The facial reactions are so broad you'd think they are doing silent film and the words and actions of their characters are literally cringe-worthy. People have told me that the camp was prevalent in the original cartoons, so I will cut it some slack. I just think it was so heavy-handed and against the rest of the film that it stuck out like a sore thumb. The quips from LaBeouf worked as did the ones from Amaury Nolasco playing off the army ""heavys"" he is with. Bay needs to stick to explosions and realize that he doesn't have the chops to try and make a comedy as well. His pacing in some ""funny"" scenes is unforgivable. When the Autobots are destroying LaBeouf's yard, it was laughable the first five minutes. By minute twenty-five you just start yawning.Despite this shortcoming, though, I will say that Transformers is a great experience. You will be blown away by the special effects and computer animation. There is no way you can't be. The live action integration is effective and even the story manages to root itself in enough reality to be somewhat plausible working in a world where alien invaders have come to Earth. A popcorn summer flick through and through, you won't go wrong checking this one out for either a good time or to hop on the nostalgia train of that amazing decade of the 80's.","Jul 4, 2007",7,/10
"If you are an action-lover, don't miss this movie. If you don't expect too much from this movie, you'll be surprised. If you expect a lot from ""Transformers"", all the more you'll be surprised. It's action from beginning to end. Sometimes, you may feel a little bit lost in all the fights, and don't even recognize the good guys from the bad ones, but don't lose your mind, it's just temporary, and the next moment - everything will be clear (in most cases). ""Transformers"" are definitely not a movie only for kids. It will catch you and hold you till you get a part of the plot. It's amazing finding yourself out keeping your fingers crossed.

Sure it is about as long as Spiderman 3, but there is far more action. The acting was pretty good and there were some funny moments in this movie. The story is pretty straightforward, and it doesn't stray from the plot. The visuals in Transformers were some of the best I have seen so far, and the cinematography was pretty capturing.

I am so happy after all of the disappointing summer movies we've had so far (Pirates 3, Spiderman 3) that they finally gave us a good one. This movie is even better than the trailer makes it out to be! I know there are a small minority of people who are bashing this film for being cheesy and having lame dialogue, but give me a break! Its a summer action flick! Almost every summer blockbuster is like that. The summer movies are the ones that we shut off our brains and get blown away by the special effects and hardcore action. Michael Bay has never really been one for sophisticated dialogue (but it doesn't matter!) and as far as the cheese factor goes... IT WAS MADE FROM A SERIES OF CHILDREN'S TOYS!!! What did you expect!? These movies aren't about academy awards! Transformers is straight up entertaining. Which is what summer blockbusters are all about. It has great action throughout and offers plenty of laughs. Thankfully, it doesn't take itself too seriously, the people who made Transformers knew it was a cheesy idea and they had fun with it. This is the movie of the summer that you can't miss!!! 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (The new Die Hard movie was really good too, but Transformers is definitely better)","Jul 7, 2007",10,/10

"OK, this is why the world is going no where in the way of cinema.I have been called a fan boy or an art film elitist, but no thats not the case at all. The producers of Transformers clearly just took the naming rights of a cherished childhood cartoon and neglected to do anything with it nostalgia wise, while somehow not being able to make a single new convincing story.Now when i first came into the theater i was expecting the Citizen Kane of giant robot movies, but there wasn't even any fan service, John Turturro makes what is sure to be a regrettable cameo for such a talented actor, I assume they where trying to add some credibility to a cast of what would otherwise be b-list actors. (Sans Bernie Mac whose cameo is negliable at best) The ad placement in this movie made me borderline ill, and the fact there was little to no fan service from a past series that had such a giant following and tons of material to choose from made me damn near dry heave This is the kind of movies that are the reasons good films are dying, from the sub par acting to the nonsensical shallow plot, to the cliché dialog the whole thing reeks of Micheal Bay, and mediocrity which any one who takes movie making as an art form opposed to a circus should know by now are synonyms when it comes to film making.I can only recommend this movie to drunken frat boys, and children that don't know any better, aside from that demographic STAY AWAY!","Dec 18, 2009",1,/10

"You know, when I saw this movie in theaters, me and siblings thought it was an awesome movie. We still think it's an awesome movie.After seeing Michel Bay's other work, I think that it's pretty safe to say that this is his best work. I mean the effects are awesome, the robots are awesome, the mythology is just so engaging(it's no wonder this alone attracting Bay's attention), and the leading actor is very well done. But like the bad director he is, this movie has some flaws. The only big one that I have noticed was the story's continuity. I mean, some minor characters simply disappear from the storyline with no explanation about what happened to them in the end. I can name at least three supporting characters who we have no idea what happens to them if you pay attention.But despite this and other flaws I'm sure people have noticed, the movie still holds together and provides us with great entertainment. Whatever else you think of films done by Michel Bay, Transformers definitely is worth your time, energy, and money. A box-office success that is worth contributing to.","Oct 2, 2010",7,/10

"The graphics was awesome, I love the setting and the entire story as a whole. It was a mix of endless humor, laughs, action, drama, and an excellent story all wrapped up in one.. I did not fall asleep in the cinema this time for a change. It was everything I expected in a movie. The movie is rather sentimental for me because it was my sons favorite cartoon. One of my sons has pass away a few years ago and the movie brought back fond memories of him. The only thing missing was the original theme song ""Transformers"", which I thought would have played a the end of the movie during the credits. I will go back and see it again because the first time I cried through out the entire movie in remembrance of my beloved son Ansil. I wish he was here to see it. Great movie, great entertainment. Thumbs up for all who worked hard on putting it together!!!!!","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10
"Excuse the horrid joke above, I couldn't resist. I have never been a fan of Transformers, I never even had the toys as a kid, but I decided to see this on the basis of being a Linkin Park fan. I wanted to like it, but feared I wouldn't have the option. I was anticipating utter rubbish. I was expecting an ultra-predictable plot, annoying actors, glaring plot holes, cringe-worthy dialog and, of course, an abundance of mindless action. Only the last of these was present.True, as far as the storyline and script go, it's not exactly The Godfather, but it's not dumb enough to damage the fun. I know I may be overusing the ""pleastly surprised"" line, but I was pleasantly surprised by Shia LaBeouf. He managed to be a perfectly convincing nerd, and while he and the other characters are blatant stereotypes, one can identify with Sam throughout. The humor comes constantly and in decent quality.I haven't even mentioned the Transformers themselves. They do look very impressive, particularly when changing. The scenes of combat and destruction are downright kick-ass, notably when a roller-blading Decepticon smashes a bus in half. The overblown budget shows in every action sequence, and is matched only by the use of state-of-the art US military hardware.So, I recommend this movie without hesitation. Don't think of it as a movie for children, consider it entertainment for one's inner child.","Jan 23, 2010",,
"If you fail to service your mortgage, the bank might repossess your house. I know it works that way. I don't need to see that on screen. Even though it would come with great benefits, because it would deter people from over-indebting themselves. Transformers is the extreme opposite. Sentient cars is the opposite of real life sense. Morphing from robots into useless cars makes even less sense. And coming from a home planet where everyone morphs from cars into robots into cars, makes the least sense. When, as a viewer, I am promised Transformers, then I am guaranteed no lessons. Crusades, Dinosaurs and the 80s (sequels) just work. Really, Transformers is a cunning project to meticulously remove all obstacles - sense.","Feb 21, 2024",7,/10
"Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky was excellent. Peter Cullen as the voice of Optimus Prime was brilliant. Mark Ryan as the voice of Bumblebee was cool. Anthony Anderson as Glen Whitmann was Hilarius. Michal Bay did excellent of directing this film. Whats funny that there was a robot in the movie peeing on a man. Whats not very nice that the officers take Sam Witwicky and her girl friend Mikaela Banes. Whats stupid when some woman sitting on a chair was holding her middle finger up. This story is about hero robots there name where Optimis Prime, Autobot jazz, Starscream, and more those where called Transformers. Go see this movie it is excellent even the family will like this film.","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10
"Well, definitely not ""aweful"" as few have added before. The problem's that the comic relief actually disrupts the harmony of all the serious ""human"" message that the movie has to offer. But we must also consider the movie was rated 12 in most of the countries, so obviously it was made keeping young viewers in mind.Autobots exhibiting ""human"" emotions like anger and the fact that ""pride"", ""status"", ""authority"" have a similar meaning to them as us, gives them a human edge and an opportunity to interact and assimilate with mankind.Their transformation could've been made better. For example a 10 wheeled truck is not an apt tactical state for a battle.Good captivating action, but a little seriousness could have been added.","Nov 16, 2007",7,/10
"I never did like watching Transformers as a little kid, but back then everybody knew what Transformers is. I wasn't particularly looking forward to this movie, nor was I blown away by its trailers. I was thinking that this is just another CGI movie with cheesy plots and lots of fighting. Boy was I wrong. It is the best movie I've watched so far for this year! The movie started off slowly, with lots of curious humans wondering what the heck was invading earth. Later, we all will learn what the Autobots and Decepticons are, and what their mission is. It wasn't all thrown at you in one go, but the plot was slowly revealed to you, making it an enjoyable watch, as far as plot goes.There are funny times, when you laugh out loud. But it wasn't too cheesy. And there are times when you want to cry out for your favourite robot. The cast was excellent, making you believe in them and want to sit with them throughout the movie.Overall, an excellent storyline, extremely good CGI, some nice action scenes (even for the girls), with cute casts to go along. Its been a while since I voted a 10 for any movie.","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10
"I have been a huge transformers fan for as long as I can remember. I was a little skeptic going to see this movie, one because it is rated PG-13 even though the Transformers Movie 1986 was PG and the fact that Michael Bay directed, more known for his action sequences and emphasis on effects(which worked for this) not storyline. The storyline could have been better, should of focused more on the transformer characters rather then the humans. The one reason I gave this a 6 is because of the language. I took my 9 yr old to see it even though it is pg13 transformers is suppose to be for everybody there toy & TV series market does target kids 5+. I don't mind the occasional S..t here or there with him, he knows the difference between right/wrong. But having a transformer ""frenzy"" say it that kind of crossed the line and with the corny bumble bee air freshener with Bee-och. There was way to much sexual references, talking about masturbation and throwing in Mother .... than a sound effect. Come on if you are going to put a Hasbro name in the credits then make it PG and no need for the sexual references. Look at Star Wars the greatest original trilogy of all time. Lucas never put any of that crap into his movies and transformers to me should be in the same class of movies. If I wanted bad language, sex & cars then I would go see bad boys. The performance from Shia LaBeouf was excellent he played a good spike.","Jul 5, 2007",6,/10
"I'm a big sci-fi movie fan, so this was a must-see movie. However, the cartoon-like effects and ""everybody is a teenager"" cast was a little too much for me. This was an excellent idea for a movie, but ended up being more like a 2.5 hour Saturday morning cartoon.The movie has a fantastic storyline. It's basically about alien robots that are at war with each other and are simultaneously searching for a lost artifact of their civilization. How cool is that? Unfortunately, it wasn't executed very well. Aside from minor plot-hole issues and endless brand-name product placement (more than I've ever seen in any movie), there were two main problems.First, all the critical roles are teenagers. Literally. I'm not just talking about the actors, but rather the literal ages of the characters in the movie. The top code-crackers at the Dept. of Defense are teenagers ... the critical characters calling the shots for all of mankind are teenagers ... the Transformers all prefer to communicate with teenagers. You get the picture. Sorry - it's just a little too crazy.Secondly, the effects were not very good. Much of the time, the Transformer scenes looked like cartoons. I would have gladly settled for fewer, but more realistic, special effects. I was willing to let it go in the beginning, but then the cartoon effects became so common-place that it became really annoying.If you're in the teenage demographic and a very forgiving sci-fi fan, you may really like this movie. For everyone else, this may end up being a let-down. Keep your expectations minimal.","Jul 13, 2007",4,/10
"Ever since the 1998 blockbuster Armageddon and the 2001 blockbuster Pearl Harbor comes the movie that gives so much damage and destruction between the Autobots and the Decepticons. The movie stars Shia Labeouf, Megan Fox, Peter Cullen (voice of Optimus Prime), Hugo Weaving (voice of Megatron) Tyrese Gibson, Anthony Anderson, Josh Duhamel, Rachel Taylor, etc.The plot is so hard to explain, but I will say this is the best movie I've seen in the summer. The fights are always awesome, they were never boring, the models of the robots looked great, and everything in the movie are excellent. The final battle where they take place in the city kept me on the edge of my seat for awesomeness throughout the whole movie!!!I also like *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, which it was a box office success, and considered the best sequel ever, but however, nominated and won by the those stupid, idiotic, brain dead people of the Raspberry Awards (opposite version of the Academy Awards), but it was very sad to see Transformers 2 win Worst Picture. I cried a bit when that happened. But as a movie, its a must see, but as for the people of the Golden Raspberry Awards, YOU SUCK!!! Everyone as an opinion, but those Raspberry Award people just blew it completely. I hate you. *(Don't trust Wikipedia on the negative reception for that movie, It will ruin it)After that serious rant I made, this movie and the sequel are masterpieces. One of the best movies ever.Transformers gets 10 stars","Mar 9, 2010",10,/10
"The original TV show was back in the 80s. This came out in 2007. It was unexpected that they would make a live-action movie (and then go on to make two sequels). I saw this before I watched the original show - I was 12 when I saw this movie. But although they aren't equals, this movie is really good! It should've won an academy award just because, to the adults, it brought back the 80s. Still, what made this movie not be a ripoff was that it had an entirely different plot than the show did (no Energon, all about the Allspark). It was directed in a well- executed manner. Acting was okay. Fight scenes were...intense. The plot was fine. So overall, why 7 stars? Because I didn't know squat about Transformers before I saw this. Now, I have a huge collection of the figures. It started a new obsession for me. That's how much I liked it. It's a good movie. But if you're really a huge fan of the original cartoon, you probably will think it's a ripoff.","Dec 22, 2011",6,/10
"Whenever I hear about a movie getting so much hype and attention, I have a feeling it is going to be bad. I figure the vast majority of the country is made up of idiots, so I will probably be wasting my time seeing a movie that has been so highly promoted as ""the best action movie ever and so awesome"". With that said, since we are Netflix members I decided to go ahead and add it to my list. It just came in and we made the mistake of actually watching it. My husband got up halfway through the movie and did not return. I decided to stick it out, hoping it might get better. But congratulations American citizens, you did not let me down! I can continue feeling as I do about you. The only thing I am going to ask about this over-the-top unbelievable plot line is: If Shia's grandfather went to the Arctic Circle and died, how in the world could he have passed on his ""secret map glasses""? Does anyone else have a problem with that?!","Oct 24, 2007",1,/10
"This is what a fun, entertaining, over-the-top, two hours (2:24) at the movies should be like. Bombastic? Yes. Cheesy? Of course. This movie is based on a cartoon and a bunch of toys - it's FUN. Shia La Beouf is great. The rest of the cast is very good. Who cares about the goofs (they are always fun to detect anyways). The soundtrack is powerful, and the rest of the audio is superb. The humor is lighthearted, and yet the battle scenes are wicked. Every time the robots transform I could hear gasps from the audience. The sound they make during their transforming has elements from the cartoon, just like the transporters in the Star Trek movies resembled the TV Series. Very cool. See it. Enjoy it. Laugh and cheer with it.","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10
"First he turns one of the worst atrocities in American history, into a love story. And an all out puss-fest.Michael Bay, why must you destroy the story of Transformers? I give you props for the amazing CGI. But your major flaw was changing the look and the storyline. The Transformers are way too detailed, and have way too many parts to actually distinguish which Robot is which (Decepticons). The battles are amazing, but it's extremely hard to tell who exactly is doing what to whom. The other flaw, is the weak-ass-ed storyline. The cartoon had the humans as mainly insignificant creatures. Caught between the waring factions. The majority of the film is based around Sam Witwicky. I understand the need for this, but give me a break Bay. Can't you put your ego and talentless mind aside for one minute, and just make an all out slug-fest? This should have been a CGI infested movie of WAR between two robot armies.There were plot holes galore as well. The product placement was insane. Almost to the point of annoyance. An XBOX 360 comes to life? A mountain dew vending machine? A Cadillac comes to life and attacks a girls head? Where did these things go to? Why did the cube turn them, and essentially make them evil?I'm in awe, that someone would find this script to have been green-lit. One can only hope Spielberg isn't losing his touch, and finds something as mediocre to use for the next Indiana Jones film.If only I could remember more....I was so dumbed down by the experience, aside from the general eye candy that I can barely remember who I am. Christopher Nolan has more talent in his pubic hair. Thanks Michael Bay. You've turned one of my favorite shows from the 80's into another Michael Bay, Nancy boy film...Way to get the story wrong.","Jul 10, 2007",,
"I grew up watching during the weekends Transformres, I also ,like any 10 to 12 year old boy Transformers' toys and I put then to fight.So I will give you my point of view to the first Transformers movie ,which came out in 2007. The reason why ,I start with this and not the most recent one is the fact that ,the first of this Franchise is the best and by best I mean most tolerable to watch ,because the next three are treason against the Cybetronians as a whole. To start with the good part the CGI are almost perfect and the voices of Optimus and Megatron are amazing. And now the bad part. Firstly everyone here acts awfully indeed and the worst were by fact Megan Fox and Shia Lebouf ,their characters are so stereotypical that the supporting cast seems to play OK, and that no easy feet. Next the action is fully of unfocused scenes, sake camera and too many stupid one liners. Thridly and by far the most significant reason , why I have negative feeling for this movie is the fact the the Tranformers are not the MAIN characters in THEIR OWN MOVIE. To add insult to injure this flick nominated for 3 Oscar. WHO? This has no explanation apart for the effects part. The last complain is the ending which although is not horrible, I felt it rushed when I saw again the movie. The funny thing is that , when I was in my teens and Isaw for the first time I like it ,but when after a year when I saw it again one year later ,was a nostalgia killer ,for a time I end up hating the Transformers. If someone is to blame is the Paramount and Micheal Bay, the later has more blame because he made of Franchise out of it and thanks to the previous mentioned acclaim ,his ego went berserk. As a result of that, the following flicks were even worse. First Tranformer ,then Teenage Mutant Nintza Turtles and in 2017milk to it will come out a Power Ranger movie ,it is official, Hollyhood is set on milking to death our childhood.","Apr 22, 2016",6,/10

"Since the original Star Wars took home loads of cash about thirty years ago there have been tons of directors trying of create the next great action blockbuster. ""Transformers"" is a noble effort in that tradition but ultimately falls a little short.Say what you will but I think that Michael Bay is as talented a director as you will find in action movies today. Bay and the film's editors know what it takes to make a movie that rolls forward with locomotive force. The visual effects are impressive as well, though I can't recall anything that was particularly breathtaking.The acting is pretty good, which is no surprise since Bay's pictures usually attract talented actors looking for a big payday. Special mention should go to Shia LaBeouf, who is magnetic in the lead human role. Unfortunately, a sometimes goofy script means that talented individuals like John Turturro get saddled with some especially corny lines. Luckily, the script is, for the most part, at least superficially serious. However, it is undeniably aimed at a teen audience, so expect a boy-meets-girl subplot and photogenic teens in several of the key roles.The main problem with the picture is that it is difficult to present a story that is in any way plausible without veering too far from the original concept. That being said, the movie moves at such a pace that you don't have time to consider any of the flaws in the 'scientific' explanations. Nevertheless, the screenwriters deserve credit for producing a story that is semi-plausible yet still true to the TV show that fans grew up with.So, if you're looking for an enjoyable action flick then I can't imagine you being disappointed with this. However, when it's over you may realize that there is nothing beneath the shiny, metal surface.","Jan 5, 2008",7,/10
"I have no idea what the kids who watched the transformers TV show were looking for, but they certainly missed an exciting movie while they were bitching about how Michael Bay ruined their kiddy show.This was one hell of a sound and visual experience that showed special effects at their finest.No, there was no acting to speak of, except for Megan Fox, who one hot babe and someone to look for in the future. It was fun, however to see old favorites like John Turturro, Anthony Anderson, and a really funny Bernie Mac.This is one of those movies you just sit back and enjoy.","May 16, 2008",8,/10

"Optimus Prime: Sorry, my bad.No, it is I who is sorry, Optimus Prime, for I do not accept your apology. You can hardly be held accountable for the two-hour plus mess that is TRANSFORMERS, 2007's tent pole original blockbuster, but my anger needs to be directed somewhere. Seeing as how director Michael Bay is not standing here in front of me, you my fictional friend will have to do. It could have all been so simple. You had a pretty solid cartoon back in the 80's. The Autobots and Decepticons had their crews in check and their goals set. Both teams found themselves here on Earth. The Decepticons were bent on bleeding the world of its energy to bring back to your home planet somewhere so that they could rule while you were here to stop them and protect us simple humans at the same time. They would plot and you would plan and battles would go on with very little involvement on the part of the human race. Why then, in your live action feature film debut, do we see no trace of you but instead a few unpopular Decepticons and a ton of one-liner jokester humans for the first half of this film? Could your agent not negotiate you some more screen time?The Transformers from the cartoon series had personality, ranging from a corny sense of humour to loyalty to caring. The movie machines, well, they have names and that's about it. Gone are the neurosis and power struggles, replaced by supposed strength and stature. Standing and looking pretty for our enjoyment only takes us so far. Without squabbling between Megatron and Starscream to scoff at, we're left to seek out personality from the human faction of this ensemble. Unfortunately, like any ""good"" action movie, actual colour in a character or a performance is entirely optional. Army boys anxiously await their return to their loved ones at home; high school jocks mock the dorks to look good for their girls; and those same girls can twist their hips just right to catch the setting sun against their bare stomachs. With such reusable filler characters, no actor actually has to try to craft depth into the fold. Luckily, the ""IT"" boy himself, Shia LaBeouf, is young enough and hungry enough to not forsake his own talents to the point of banality. As Sam Witwicki, TRANSFORMERS' central human character, LaBeouf is charming, shy and earnest. His performance shines like the brightest piece in a sea of scrap metal and solidifies his face as one that will be seen for many years to come.Why do I find myself going on and on about people in a review for a movie about machines? Perhaps this is because TRANSFORMERS treats the Transformers like an afterthought most of the time. Granted, they are very elaborate and exquisite constructions but how can they be seen as anything but secondary when some of the most popular Transformers don't make an appearance until the last third of the film? And as beautiful as the talented folks at Industrial Light and Magic made these reincarnations, they are a bit too complex for their own good. Watching all the metal pieces swerve in and around while the machines transform made me think of the toys I had as a boy. If they were ever that complicated to transform, I doubt I would have played with them for as long as I did. The abundance of detail gets even messier when the Transformers start to rumble with each other. Through what he believes to be fancy camera work, Bay over uses close-up's and quick editing to turn his machines into metal monstrosities that are at times near impossible to distinguish from one another. You can't tell who's who until the metallic mess breaks apart and one machine stands while another has fallen. There's an awful lot of fighting but it's also a lot of not being able to tell who's winning.It is pointed out to me time and time again that big budget action movies require a good chunk of our brains to be shut off in order to be enjoyed. Are we not tired yet of filmmakers giving us the bare minimum and the same old conventions while expecting us to fall over ourselves at the sight of awesome movie magic? TRANSFORMERS is not horrible because it is a special effects driven action film. It is horrible because it took the enormous potential to be a cheeky, geeky visual wonder and diminished that by dumbing it down to a mess of gunfire, product placement and hollowed-out, clunky machines. While it can be fun to relax our minds and enjoy the good times, it is not acceptable to dangle a shiny piece of metal before our eyes to distract us from seeing that that's all you got.","Jul 5, 2007",3,/10
"The characters have the same names as the original cartoon from the 80's but some look different in both robot and vehicle form. this, however, shouldn't spoil the film for 80's Trannsformers fans. I suppose they have updated some of the vehicles to be more modern, after all this film is being paired with massive marketing and merchandising schemes which will be aimed at today's young kids and teens. The film itself was excellent. The opening sequence is a blinder and there is somewhat of a wait to see Prime, which in my opinion is the main Transformer. The special effects are slick and very impressive. The transformers transforming are great to watch ( just like the Citroen ads)but I do think they should have included the transforming noise from the original cartoon! Prime sounds like the original, which is good, and they have kept some of the original phrases, like, ""Autobots move out!""... although I was a bit disappointed not to hear, ""Autobots Transform!"". The storyline is pretty good. It is kept simple and easy to follow which is good as the film isn't one that is supposed to provoke much thought, but to be action packed and entertaining - which it definitely is. They have included a certain element of humour, which surprisingly goes down very well as the timing is spot on. If you grew up with the cartoon I think you will really enjoy this adaptation, even though it slightly strays from the original characters, and I think todays kids will love this too. I would definitely recommend it. This will undoubtedly be my favourite film of the year.","Jul 30, 2007",10,/10
"When I first saw the trailer to this, I didn't know what to think but the premise was something new to me on the big screen so was sort of hyped for this movie. I don't know if it's because it's the first time I seen robots in great CGI beating the crap out of each other or something, but I had a entertaining time with this movie. The plot isn't anything amazing but it's passable and the build up was decent as well and the final battle in this flick was just awesome to watch. The human elements in this movie is pretty weak but it's bearable and it's alright to some degree. I didn't really like the clichés in this movie though. About the boy with the heart of gold that gets the hottest girl in school by doing something heroic. The humor in this is alright, not great but didn't bother me all that much although it felt a bit cheap. I know a lot of Transfomers fan will bash on this movie, but I will give my honest opinion. This movie was actually a quite entertaining movie, a good popcorn flick that the whole family will have a good time with. I kinda dislike it when people say ""it's the type of movie you will have to shut your brain off while watching in order to enjoy it"" that usually means the story is a complete mess. In this case though it didn't get to the point of me getting so annoyed with it that I just wanted to see action every minute. Megan Fox is going to be exposed a lot more after this and I will just say it's not because of her acting. As for Shia LaBeouf, he was alright. Maybe it's because this is his first time being in this franchise, but didn't get all that tired of his character or was very annoyed by him. Overall this is a pretty darn good popcorn flick that just might be worth your time. It would have been better if some of the human bullcrap that was just there for humor and parts that was pointless to the story besides the action was cut out since the movie seemed a bit longer than it should be. But that is just a few negatives in my opinion. I give this movie a 7.8 for being entertaining, it would have been better if the robots at least got some more development cause you really don't care who gets destroyed. This movie is a pleasant surprise.7.8/10","Jul 2, 2011",7,/10

"This is literally one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was skeptical when the initial announcement to produce this movie was made, and I was especially skeptical with all the hype surrounding the release. However, this is one of the few cases where the movie not only lives up to the hype, but surpasses it. Even non-transformer fans will enjoy this movie. I was especially impressed with the special effects. It really seemed like there were robots acting alongside the actors and actresses. Michael Bay did a great job in conveying emotion into all of the characters in their mannerisms and appearance. You bonded with the Autobots and feared the Decepticons.","Jul 5, 2007",10,/10
This movie was very attracting to me and I thought that it will be some new kind of movies . Theme also was interesting . After watching this movie impressions are maybe a bit worse than expecting but movie is quite good . Some people would say that it is too much graphic and effects . I also agree but I think that behind this is very interesting story . Movie has also exciting parts which maybe disappointed me but I am glad because I watched it . Cast wasn't so impressing . Shia LeBouf is actually not my favorite actor and I don't like his performances . He was quite good and sometimes better than I expected . Megan Fox wasn't so impressing . I told this no matter on her beauty . I think that she can be also some visually good appearance . There are many other actors which were pretty solid .

I was completely wrong, the first sequence alone was amazing. Not only did this movie have nice action scenes, the funny parts were actually.. well, funny! The best word to describe this movie is ""EPIC"". I remember the first time Optimus Prime came on screen the entire theater I was in started clapping and cheering. The movie was excellent. I highly recommend this movie and if you don't like this movie, don't bother watching movies at all because you're an idiot.","Jul 13, 2007",10,/10
"I got to see Transformers....not to be confused with Transformers: The Movie, the 1986 animated film that leaves a couple of continuity mistakes with this recent flick (as does the original show and comics). headed by Michael Bay as director and Steven Spielberg as exec. producer, this recent summer blockbuster is a modern day ""rebuilding"", if you will, of the 80's cartoon many of my generation loved as a child (and still do today, in some cases). some changes have been made to bring this concept in the real world, yet the general love for the Transformers remains intact. even if the intentions were higher than the result.Transformers' storyline follows around a teenage boy (Shia LaBeouf) leading a normal teenage lifestyle while trying to woo the girl of his dreams (Megan Fox), or, more likely, his fantasies. his dad buys him a car from a used car dealer (a small cameo by Bernie Mac). the car he ends up getting turns out to be a giant robot, which engages in a battle with another robot. eventually, more robots land on Earth and meet up with the boy to find a pair of glasses that may hold the key to the planet's future. the leader, Optimus Prime (brought to life once again by Peter Cullen) explains that there are two races of robotic beings: the benevolent, heroic Autobots and the evil, destructive Decepticons. Prime explains that the source of all their power comes from a cube called the AllSpark, and that the Decepticons plan to use it to conquer everything. meanwhile, the Decepticons have already crept into disguise amongst the human world and are seeking to release their tyrannical leader, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving, of V For Vendetta, The Matrix, and The Lord Of The Rings).and so and so forth continues into some of the most eye-popping CGI action scenes we've seen to date. seriously, the special digital effects for Spider-Man 3, Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End, and Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer combined don't even hold a candle to the sheer amazing attention to detail put forth in Transformers. I still revel in the fact that we've brought cinematic technology into reality as far as we probably can since seeing this movie so many days ago. i'd always wondered what real-life version of my favorite cartoons would look like, but i'd never have believed that it was going to be like this. the characters are also as interesting to watch as the CGI that brings them to life. the Autobots (namely Optimus Prime and Ironhide) have some really great characterization, and the Decepticons (or rather, Megatron and StarScream) act just as one would imagine them. one by one, the action scenes blast you out of the seat. there's also some really good humor here, as well as some fine voice acting. and trust me, it could have been bad. don't complain about Frank Welker not doing a voice-over. what might be most appealing to some fans is the dialog that parallels the mood and memorable moments of the original cartoons and movie. overall, the best features about this film are the CGI wonders and the tiny details they put into the film. what's really excellent though, is the film's instrumental score. i'm not sure who wrote or composed it, but it's nigh perfect in compliance with the movie's atmosphere.but, like every other movie, it has it's bad points. where Transformers really suffers is strangely enough in it's concept execution. now, i'm not saying that this wasn't a good movie. I think it's a great movie. it's just that this is a realistic version of a 1980's cartoon about cars and jets and other machines that turned into giant robots with laser pistols. it's not exactly the kind of flick you'd think was a surefire thing. because of this, everyone is going to go into this movie - hardcore fans, casual fans, newcomers, nostalgics, people who couldn't give a sh*t about anything Transformers-related before this movie - with something different in their minds. not necessarily expectations, but more of what they want this movie to be. in turn, this mind frame is going to cause of a lot of disappointment for a lot of people, in various ways. for me, Transformers was a little too ""open"". it leaves lots and lots of space for the already-in-production two sequels, but I don't think that that's such a good thing. sure, it means more robotic butt-kickery, but do we really need another good-movie-turned-franchise to wear down into the ground until there's nothing left? weren't Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, X-Men, and Jurassic Park enough? another bad point about Transformers is the human acting. sometimes it's very good, sometimes it's too cheesy for it's own good. sometimes we get some good characterization, sometimes we get a throwaway character with no substance or value to the film (i'm thinking directly of the pointless jab at George W. Bush and Jon Voight's all-commanding Secretary of Defense). overall, the acting is inconsistent. Shia's very good, and fun to watch, but Fox provides nothing more than a tantalizing body to drool over. there are some minor annoyances of mine, but I won't go into them since they'll probably be mine alone and don't really take away from the film. except for the fact that the movie ends with Shia making out with Megan on top of Bumblebee, who's pretty much his best friend by the end of the movie. way to let your pal in on the action, there, kid. cue Prime's excellent ending speech.basically, Transformers is a fun ride, well-worth the admission price (or possibly even two or three) and by far one of the best films of the summer. a welcome change from all the lackluster disappointments of other summer blockbusters this year, and without a doubt one of Michael Bay's best.","Jan 16, 2010",7,/10
"How did this movie end up so bad? In theory its a movie that couldn't fail.. yet somehow they manage to make it not just dumb (which can be fine in an action flick) but incredibly BORING as well.It bears an uncanny resemblance to Herbie: Fully Loaded in terms of its casting, the sophistication of it's plot, and the style of movie making. Its basically a lightweight teen comedy.. which happens to have a few big robots that show up occasionally to do clownish comedy.The lead character is reasonably funny, in a lightweight kinda way. Its just that the jokes go on.. and on... and on... after about 20 minutes you are severely hoping he'll get annihilated by the decepticons.Unfortunately for the audience.. the decepticons don't really even show up for about 90 minutes.. apart from a crazy, comedy, mini decepticon which acts kinda like a hyperactive jar jar binks.Even more criminally, the Autobots aren't in the movie much either. Probably their largest amount of screen time is an ENDLESS comedy skit where they bumble around the back garden, treading on fountains, getting peed on by dogs and trying to hide from the kid's parents. (who are also kinda funny.. but seem to think they are in an American Pie movie).The special effects are pretty sweet, but not quite as amazing as they are made out to be. The integration with the real world is usually pretty good. But the little jar-jar robot looks like some reject SFX from 5 years ago.The action sequences are huge... with lots of explosions and destruction. But they aren't very coherent. Part of the problem is the new designs for the robots.. when they are in motion they look like an indistinct pile of garbage. Trying to see what is actually going on when two indistinct shapes are flipping around and fighting in amongst all the explosions, and with all the bad editing, is pretty hard.Which must be why they mostly ignore the autobots and concentrate on showing us the US army shooting at stuff, and running in slow motion. (its a great advert for the army... plus yahoo, pontiac, and all the other blatant product placement).The action sequences just don't measure up in terms of excitement, pacing and coherence to recent movies like Die Hard 4.0.The film gets 4 points for Optimus Prime. He still rocks. His voice is cool. He's not actually in the movie much.. but when he is he usually rocks. Unfortunately it then loses 2 for making him say ""my bad"".Also.. what happened to the cute blonde hacker, and her comedy sidekick (yet another one)??? They just disappeared from the story.I'm not exactly sure what happened to Michael Bay.. he made one of the best action movies ever in The Rock.. and every subsequent film has been worse. This one actually makes Armageddon look like a good movie. OK popcorn flick.. but as is, its pretty terrible. 2/10","Aug 12, 2007",2,/10
I don't see how they could've done any better than what they did. The movie was absolutely incredible. All the original elements were there and of course some new ones they had to incorporate. Definitely a must see. Lots of great moments and funny lines. The actors did a wonderful job except for Megan Fox...she just seemed like she was there taking up space and to look good which of course she did. Although she did redeem herself a bit in one sequence w/ Bumble Bee...I was very happy to see that. I know all the males in the room were oogling her. The special effects were wonderful...and as always I.L.M. exceeded themselves yet again. Go see it...even if you're not a Transformers fan...you won't be disappointed in the least bit.,"Jul 7, 2007",10,/10
This is a fine instalment and beginning to the franchise for all viewers to watch. It could have been a lot better if the crew had put in some extra effort. The storyline was a bit straightforward. There were some parts that were that obvious that they did not have any real surprises. The cast selection was alright. They connected nicely to the storyline. This instalment reveals to viewers the true nature of choosing sides and loyalty. I would know which side I would pick. This instalment also reveals to viewers the true power and reality of what everyone is really made of in difficult times. I do not know what I am really made of. This is an alright instalment and start to the franchise for everyone to watch.,"Nov 18, 2023",6,/10

"After seeing this movie I felt I had to share my opinions. I have read all the "" OH MY GOD this is the best thing since sliced bread!!!!"" reviews as well as the "" Michael Bay should be hung from the tallest tree possible for what he has done to the Transformers!!"" ones.While I'm not quite in the gushing pile, I am very far from the ""it sucks"" bunch.Right from the get go this movie broke into an action sequence that is just utterly amazing and well choreographed. Michael Bay does action very well and this movie played to his strengths.As a junkie of the old 80's cartoon and being something of a Transformers geek (I am married and do have kids) I held them in an icon stature and initially felt that the designs of the robots should have followed the toy line and cartoon closer. BOY WAS I WRONG.... The character designs were excellent and worked well for the movie and were totally believable.This movie delivered on so many levels for me. From the action sequences to the little touches of comedy such as Iron Hide commenting on wanting to shoot Sam's parents because they were annoying. I think the nay sayers are saying so because this movie didn't fit in with their narrow closed minded expectations of what should have been.My only true complaint was some of the overtly sexual innuendo and unneeded references to male self gratification which made for some very delicate explanations to my seven year old.Overall, this is an excellent summer movie and well worth seeing during the summer of sequels.","Sep 6, 2007",7,/10
"Until this day, i absolutely despised the auto-bots, and loved the decepticons, they are cooler looking, have better names, and are more powerful (i like to believe so) than the auto-bots. This movie made my beliefs the opposite. I've never seen the decepticons so.....so.....like killing machines, without any other emotion, they just wanted to kill people. And then comes Optimus around the corner, with the heroic music and poof.....i was stunned....i then realized, he is the hero, he is the main character of the transformers and he is meant to be liked, i liked to be the rebellious kid who had different opinions than others, but today on, protect and serve (transformers freak mode...off)","Jul 3, 2007",8,/10
"For starters... I am a ""Transformers G1"" fan and I love those good old 80s TV series. Because I think they were great! So expect a ranting that is kinda mix of Christian Bale and Lewis Black.Now! Let's start with the people who came up with the retarded idea for this film and those guys are Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and John Rogers. They are the ""writers""... who ruined our childhood by their idea and thanks to Bay this idea was produced on big screen. The producers of this film said that they are a G1 fans and they wanted to make the same film. Well... they lied. The idea was to give us robots who don't talk at all... Have they even seen a G1 cartoon? Than Orci and Kurtzman come up with the idea that robots should talk, but they're will not be the focus of the film... And that's ladies and gentlemen... the Hollywood. They should rename it - No-idea-wood. So, take the original idea, turn it to a dump and hand it to Michael Bay.Which leads us to Bay himself. This guy is unbelievable. Who just keep making expensive films that looks like giant commercials. His camera angles, plot holes... incredible! How come that this guy exist in the world of cinema? Explosions? Son of a... OK, we expect explosions in Transformers film, so... good for Bay. But, not good for us. Bay is really an expert to irritate audiences and ruin his own films. I guess what? He did ruined our childhoods. The G1 cartoons are cool even today. They were the best! Now, Bay's directing of the film... nothing but dumb plot holes, for one moment, it is a middle of the day, the next second - night. Who turned off the lights?! Shallow, irritating (human) characters, they seemed lost in the film. I mean, look at the actors, they looked so uninterested so... without emotions. I am not saying that most of them were bad actors, but they really looked kinda... ""Oh, we are here, we are payed"". I think that the only good thing is music score by Steve Jablonsky. And there are few more. We'll be back later on that...Actors: Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky (the name Sam... was it that hard to give him a real name - 'Spike'! His name is Spike!). Shia is not bad actor, but he seemed pretty irritating on some occasions, he is more like to be a future comedian in sweet, romantic comedies, or action comedies. Megan Fox as Mikaela. Megan was there just to look hot and sexy, for that's all she is... hot and sexy. To attract moviegoers that find leading actress pretty. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson... nothing special in their performances. Rachel Taylor, well she is not bad as an actress, but... she was here for cuteness too. Anthony Anderson was here for comic relief, but no luck, he was loud and irritating. Jon Voight and John Tururro? Two greatest actors in the film, they did this for the money. When you see Turturro as a g-man, you know that it's not gonna be serious. His character was designed as another comic relief, but... no luck. Kevin Dunn as Ron Witwicky, he was good (but they didn't address him to his G1 nickname 'Sparkplug', and he is not an engineer...) Julie White as Judy Witwicky, she was awesome! (but alas... Spike didn't have a mother in G1). We also had Bernie Mac in some of his last film roles...Now, the robots. As Bay stated ""he didn't want to make a stupid robot film"" and ""he didn't want for robots to look like some funny boxes from the cartoon"". If you don't want to make a stupid film about robots... don't do it at all! Let's start with the design of the robots. Well, I can't argue with that, the design is good, it's very rational in many ways, rather to look like ""boxes"", but if you ask me, you could put ""box robots"" in the film, but the movie crew who works on design, on concept idea, they were to lazy to even try and test how would it look. But, the robots didn't look that bad. The wrong thing about them is their character. In G1, the robots were important, they were the focus. But, here, robots comes second. The autobots are heroic and decepticons are evil and that's it. They don't talk much, they didn't really give some stronger personality, instead, they are retards. Bumblebee for example, he is mute and he could communicate through the sounds and radio and that's a sacrilege! Bumblebee is one of the most famous autobots, if not even more famous than Optimus himself. Megatron for example is just evil and that's it. He wasn't that long on screen, he came out of nowhere and that's it ""I'm evil and I am megatron!"". Optimus was OK, just like we expected, so Peter Cullen (the voice of Optimus who did the voice in G1 cartoon), he was Optimus again and he was good. Hugo Weaving voiced Megatron. Hugo is a brilliant actor, but he was given to little to make something out of it. Decepticons are speaking in cybertronian language... what a waste of time and idea. Keep talking in English! Why don't autobots talk in their own language? Because it makes decepticons more menacing. Face it, robots look good outside, but inside - retards. The only transformer that I like is Bonecrusher, he looked cool and he had a cool, evil personality, alas... he was there very short. And that's your film... ruined forever with this piece of crap. Bay also did a sequel, because no one touches his ""baby"", well maybe it's your baby, but it's not your original idea. I give it 6 out of 10 because it is entertaining.","Oct 15, 2012",6,/10
"My wife and I walked out after 40 minutes. This was a huge disappointment to me. When I first heard they had made a movie our of a bad 20 year old cartoon (and toy) I dismissed it but when i saw the ratings on IMDb for my demo(Males over 45 rated 7.3) I figured this would be a Pirates of the Caribean pleasant surprise. it wasn't. And here's the thing: I like almost any movie with Sci Fi, Robots, or military action and this had all three. Yet it was offensively boring. Am i completely out of touch or have the super reliable IMDb ratings lost their way? there have been plenty of times when I liked a movie a lot more or a lot less than my peers, but never a case where I give a movie a 1 then got a 7.3 from everyone else.The transformers CGI was cartoonish. The comedy was silly and not funny. The plot was non-existent. Maybe it got better after the 40 minutes i saw (there were 100 minutes to go) but I can't imagine it would've saved my opinion. I'm not a movie snob. I loved comedies like spaceballs, Austin powers, and Waynes world. I ate up Sci Fi like I Robot, Solyaris, blade runner, etc. All of these had a plot or well written comedy. what am I missing here? One or two other films this year were much worse (in my opinion) than their ratings. Rattatouille comes to mind as one of the only Pixar offerings I didn't love and somehow it got a 8.3 from my demo (I'd give it a 4 or 5). Please someone tell me have I lost my mind?","Aug 5, 2007",1,/10
"Transformer fans rejoice! Lovers of awesome action packed spectacle rejoice! Michael Bay has delivered us one hell of a cinematic roller coaster ride. This Transfan just had the pleasure of seeing a sneak preview of the new film that starts everywhere on July 3 (although there are some early showings on July 2 at 8PM and midnight) and I walked out of the movie theater with a great big smile on my face.Even the fact that it was pouring down rain and my car was a football field away from the entrance to the movie theater couldn't dampen my parade after this movie. This film delivers the goods on all accounts and delivers them in a big way! The action is fantastic, the special effects are perfect, and surprisingly enough (in such an action special effects driven feature) the actors all turn in great performances that add that extra special touch to the film. Also, the humor works very well and is satisfying and natural instead of silly and forced. Transformer fans will be pleased and yet people who don't have a clue who Optimus Prime or Megatron are will enjoy this ride, too judging by the enthusiastic reaction of my friend who knew nothing going into the film other than that it was a movie that featured giant transforming robots.About the only small complaint that I can offer is that they did such a great job with setting up the story and bringing the Transformers into the picture that they wind up having too little time in the epic finale to develop any of the Decepticon characters to the degree that lovers of the comic and show will remember. However, I'm sure that this will be rectified in the sequel that is hinted at by the movie's final minutes.Go see this movie as soon as you can on the big screen! You'll have a blast.So far this has been the best time at the movies all year for yours truly.What a great movie! Thank you, Michael Bay.","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"Transformers (2007) ***Perhaps its the kid in me. Perhaps its the kid I was; back when I adored the Transformers cartoons and toys. Whatever it is, its not because Michael Bay knows how to craft beautiful art. It might be though because Michael Bay finally kicked the paint can with enough force and accuracy that when it hit the canvas it made some pretty neat patterns. Yes, Transformers has faults and plot holes that an Autobot could fall through. Yes its over stuffed and overblown. Yes its far too long and filled with more product placements than you see during the super bowl. Yes 90% of the dialogue is cheesy and no Michael Bay still cannot direct humans to save his own life. But I'll admit, when I was enjoying Transformers, I enjoyed the hell out of it.Michael Bay, who has arguably directed some of the most awful movies in the world (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) and my choice for the worst (Bad Boys II), has finally done something right. Its too bad that he realized it at some point and kept running a few miles past the finish line with it. The movie starts out with some traditionally cheesy moments and gung ho join the army because we're awesome junk. No big surprise, Bay stuffs in the greatness of the US Army wherever he can. However he does poke some fun at Bush and the US Government's lies. Too bad its regarding Aliens and nothing actually significant. But even the staunch member of the opposition that I am, I was able to ignore it most of the time. When there is humans on screen, when they work its because of one reason only, Shia LaBeouf (Well John Turturro has his moments). He is showing himself to be a great actor, even in the middle of otherwise mediocrity. The movie works because of the Transformers and LaBeouf, and the completely over the top and silly action sequences of which there are many. The CGI is great, but Bay who seemingly realized this flaunts it to the point of exhaustion and tedium. And because of that, Transformers just about overstays its welcome. So much time is put into the final fight, that it feels like they were unsure where to go from there and how to actually end the fight itself, which seems to come quickly considering how long the fight lasts. But for all its faults, Transformers is far and away Bay's best movie. Though if there is a sequel i would much rather see someone else direct. If you go into this with low expectations and in the mood to see popcorn movies at there most buttery, then I think you'll feel you didn't waste your money... well that kid inside you will feel that way.3/4","Jul 6, 2007",7,/10
"I don't understand and it's impossible for me to understand why this movie is being so much well rated by people. This is a crap that only Michael Bay is possible to offer. It's a movie only for Americans taste and it's funny only for that audience because the movie is full of those ""american jokes"", jokes that 95% of rest of world population would not even move a facial muscle for it.Michael Bay is well known for horrible blockbusters like The Rock, Armageddon and one of the worst flops of history: Pearl Harbor. I kinda liked The Island, but I totally hated Transformers.It's sad being sit by almost 2 hours and 30 minutes of horrible acting (exception of Shia, he's a very nice boy), terrible script, awful plot and those wannabe-funny robots.Those robots are a shame. The robots on the animated series were fun because, you know, it was ANIMATED. Now, there's no reason for those robots that came from a totally different world to have hip hop manners, feel pain, have fighting techniques or just scream during a hunt: I CAN SMELL YOU. Where in the world those robots would do that? Oh, I know... Hollywood.That movie is for kids only. If adults like it, it will be just for the visual effects and for some remembering of their childhood and not for being a very interesting or funny movie.I'm completely disappointed. When the movie ended I was just wanting my money back.","Aug 19, 2007",1,/10
"I'm a Projectionist from new Zealand i just got to see the movie on the mega screen with three hundred and ninety nine others and all i can say is when the credits started to roll most of the crowd applauded and cheered i've worked at the movies two years and have never seen that. the movie itself (keeping in mind i am not a big transformers fan, and i see a few movies a week so I'm kind of jaded) was just BRILLIANT, bay keeps things moving at a blistering pace, slowly revealing the auto bots and decepticons peace by piece ensuring each set piece out does the last. the action and special effects are mind blowing for a movie with this budget (this is what spider-man 3's colossal budget should have delivered) and will honestly leave you breathless. really all i can find wrong with it was some of the humour was slightly young for me (i'm 18) but i could hear most of the audience laughing.

"the main protagonist cant act, Mitchael bay shouldn't direct, its not like the show or the original, and its boring. The jokes aren't funny its like Jamie Kennedy and the whole movie just gets confusing a little and a hefty dose of cheese seems to have been added to the movie, but most of it can't be laughed off. One particular scene was reminiscent of the fighter jet in the movie Stealth downloading songs off the internet. A few loose ends in the thin story probably suggest a sequel is coming - but how can anyone have a problem with that! It has its laughs (even if some are cheap) but the 2.5 hours go slow; I'm sure most people will leave the cinema on a low note.

"Growing up on the ""Transformers"" I knew I would see this movie and I pretty much got what I thought I would get. The thing about a movie directed by Michael Bay is you know what your going to get just like you know what your going to get when you see a movie directed by Martin Scorsese or Tarantino. First off, even though I am not a huge fan of big Summer blockbusters and movies loaded with CGI, I must admit that this movie has some of the most awe inspiring action sequences I have ever seen on film. I must hand it to Michael Bay for being a master of the visual but god is his storytelling really bad. I just could care less if the characters in all of his movies died. The writing is so corny with all the usual lame one liners and cameos by the usual suspects like Bernie Mac. Even with all the flaws I looked the other way because the robots looked so great. My main problem with the film was that they could have made it so much more authentic to the cartoon. Basically taking the best elements of each. For example, in the original show the transformers get most of the dialogue. In the movie the Decepticons barely talk to each other at all. What the hell is that ? Starscream and Megatron don't even resemble the original characters at all but I must admit Optimus Prime is very cool except for him having lips. They even got the original voice which was a nice touch. I am actually hoping for a sequel because I am hoping they will fix some of the problems that kept this from being one of my favorite action movies ever. To capture the true flavor of the original the movie must be a little darker at least for me. It's about a civil war for god sakes ! Of course I know that Hollywood will always compromise quality for money. I know they have to sell toys and market to kids and adults. Overall, I got what I expected and the action scenes made up for the lame dialogue and story. I finally found a Michael Bay movie that I can watch. It's a miracle.","Jul 5, 2007",8,/10
"The beginning of a long-derided franchise, which only in the age of non-stop cookie cutter Marvel films is beginning to look like a unique auteurist vision. Bay's Transformers is a ridiculous film, stupid and sometimes meandering, yet it also has more impressive visual effects and sound design than nearly all the blockbusters released today and action scenes as only Bay could make them, with the climax especially so over the top it eventually just wears you down. This is not the kind of movie that you want to watch all in one sitting. (None of the Transformers movies are; they're a bit like Zack Snyder films in this regard).The plot concerns Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky, a teenager who, after buying his first car, finds out that it is capable of transforming into a giant alien robot to 'guard' him from the evil Decepticons. The reasons why he needs to be guarded are ridiculous, but at least they get the plot moving. Which unfolds at a loopy pace, padded out by tentative, quasi-parody Spielbergian stuff (at one point LaBeouf is riding a little girly bike through the streets, yelling that his possessed car is trying to kill him...are Bay and Spielberg making fun of the iconic bike-riding scenes from 80s movies like ET?). There is a lot of comedy in the first half of the film, some of which works particularly when Shia LaBeouf's character is involved. What doesn't work are the myriad of Roland Emmerich-esque subplots thrown in to pad out the runtime. We have researchers, hackers, government men, scenes set in the Middle East, all of which have minimal impact on the story. The humor in these scenes falls flat most of the time, except for when they show the Secretary of Defense running the country while the President of the USA does nothing-this originally would play well as a swipe at George Bush but in the age of Joe Biden it seems ever more pertinent. (Speaking of Bush, there is a way the film could be vaguely read as a Bush/War on Terror allegory, with the Autobots standing in for the USA and the humans as the Middle Easterners. For once I wish the writers would have elaborated on certain political parallels).Finally after around an hour the true stars of the film appear: all the Transformers. The effects used to bring them to life are among the best Hollywood has done, maybe even on par with Davy Jones from the POTC series. But what Bay does next is somewhat baffling. The plot requires the Transformers to get a pair of glasses (?) from Witwicky, so they travel to his home and initiate a slapstick sequence: trying to stay hidden and not destroy everything. Wow. Giant robot heroes from outer space and in their first scenes Bay presents them as a bunch of oversized cybernetic Jerry Lewises.Some words must also be said for the way Witwicky's parents are depicted. These two are so aggressively stupid, so absolutely devoid of anything resembling human intelligence that they come close to derailing the entire movie. I loathed every second they appeared on the screen. It's just Bay's usual tawdry, off-kilter 'humor', but they're so misguided that it's a mystery why Spielberg or even the hack writers didn't get him to tone the idiocy down. Heck, they even dialed it up for the sequel.Overall it's certainly a strange film but nonetheless worth a watch despite itself. There's a kinetic force that Bay brings to his films, even when he sacrifices continuity on the altar of style. Looking back, it certainly predicates the CGI gloop that Hollywood keeps force feeding us now, but has far more personality and is refreshingly free of turgid franchise teasing. It would only be several sequels later when he would be reduced to Marvel movie levels.","Nov 20, 2022",6,/10
"What was promised for the movie?Stunning special effects: YES. That is what will impress you most.For Transformers fans maybe it will be something more, but for all the others - just VERY good action movie.Of course its plot is not something special, but you won't be worried about that and you won't be bored. It does not try to advance as sci-fi movie, it is more spectacle of high technological graphics. Maybe you won't find it as epical as LoTR, but there was nothing more technological before!About Michael Bay: Blockbusters are his forte, he deserves it ;)The film won't disappoint anyone who values drive and action in movies.","Aug 13, 2008",8,/10
"This film manages to capture the attention of the viewer.The film has an entertaining story that works, the performances are compelling, the special effects are good, the editing is good, although there are times when it is not possible to see clearly what is happening. Despite having a not so complex story, I feel that there is a good development of it, just as the humor works very well.The film manages to entertain and despite being predictable, it manages to be enjoyable.","Nov 17, 2021",7,/10
i can't believe the current rating is 8 out of 10! 8 out of 10?!?! 8 out of every ten minutes i wanted to leave the theater! the best way i could sum up the movie was to take a crap and hope the turd transformed into a refund! two key things missing in the viewing experience of the movie -mute button -fast forward button the dialog killed the entire movie. action might have been good had i not been labotomized by the horrible script NEVER will i ever watch a michael bay movie again. i should have learned this lesson after Miami vice. but the joys of watching transformers as a child plus my love of his movie heat seems to have blinded me once again.,"Jul 16, 2007",1,/10
"This was without a doubt the most fun I've ever had on a shoot. Michael Bay was intense to work with and extremely professional. Watching a true master at work was spectacular and I was really blessed to have the opportunity. The movie, of course, was nothing short of incredible. Having been there for a good part of the shooting I wasn't prepared for the final result when I saw it for the first time at the San Diego premier. The sequels will undoubtedly be just as good.It was extremely well written and the screen play was well thought out and executed. The plot line was fluid and held my attention the entire time. It held mostly true to the original series with just a few minor and necessary changes, as will any movie adaptation. All in all, it's one of those movies you can watch over and over.","Sep 10, 2008",9,/10
"Sure, the sexism and racism were there from the beginning, and the film is much too grown up for the kids who would most appreciate how childish it all is.

"Mr Spielberg can be happy and content now, at last he has produced one of the worst films of all movie history...I was never a fan of the original cartoon nor the toys but I was curious to see the movie after watching the trailer, and yes I did enjoy seeing the robots,but even that is not enough to sustain 2 hours and a half of an awful script, awful casting, awful music and preposterous, absurd and ridiculous situations.I will never be able to see another film by Michael Bay or its main actor. It makes me remember fondly Snakes on a plane.","Jul 6, 2007",1,/10

"If you're a general fan of PG-13 sci-fi thrillers, this movie is very entertaining thanks to its visuals and non-stop action. Another positive side of this movie is the humor abundance.If you're a fan of the animated series (G1/G2) though, you'll notice some alterations compared to the original concepts. They might be awkward and unpleasant to the classic series fans like me. Here are some of the movie's details I couldn't agree with.First, there is the all spark cube that gives life to technology. I'm OK with the life giving part, but to technology? Any kind? That's ridiculous. Next, the cube was lost in the universe, and it had to fall down EXACTLY on Earth, as if there could be no other planets out there in the whole universe. Megatron rushed to find it but crash landed in the polar region of Earth. (Ummm, no spacecraft for Megatron was available at that time? Hello, it's Cybertron technology; they're supposedly advanced.) And he froze in the ice, of course, like a human without a fur coat. Then an attack on the army is stricken by a military chopper shaped decepticon, who happens to be piloted by a holographic image of a man with a mustache. I think the same holo-pilot with a mustache sits in the police car decepticon later on. Why was such holographic imagery ultimately needed? Especially, with a mustache. For protection against humans? Autobots soon arrive on Earth, again just like Megatron, without an apparent spacecraft, but as if meteorites instead. Their method of acquiring an ""alternate shape mode"" is rather magical than scientifically possible by any complex and rationally explainable theory. By scanning a nearby vehicle, their new shape is instantly changed. It's weird, but in cartoons, Megatron had to manually reshape his sports car team in order to turn them into transformable robots. The same goes with Alpha Trion fixing Orion Pax and Ariel, and not waving some magical Harry Potter stick over them to heal them. But here, in the movie, it's done so effortlessly. I never thought that Megatron would accept to be nearly indistinguishable from his ""buddy"" Starscream, but he was decided to be another jet instead of his ultimate weapon shape. And finally, back to the all spark. Its ability to give life to any kind of technology is probably the most idiotic idea a writer could come up with for this movie. The cube first turned a mobile phone into a psychotic weeny bot with on-board micro weaponry, then later it accidentally sparked a phone booth into another transformer with a readily loaded arsenal. It might as well transform a microwave oven into a robot that pops corn, or worse - a toilet seat that shoots you know what.","Dec 30, 2007",7,/10
"Ignore everyone that rates this movie low in rating, all they do is complain about the idea of cars turning into robots. What's wrong with you, if you're going to complain about it then don't watch it, that's what transformers is, an amazing sci-if and action about a young man with his girlfriend finding cars that turn into robots. But it's an amazing movie, all of them are, all of it is action and sci-fi, it shows all of a boys life, starting with him in school and how he met his girlfriend and going from that to meeting the evil and the good, what an exciting movie. 10/10 all the way.","Jul 3, 2017",10,/10
"I waited a week before heading to see the Transformers. I have to give it 6 out of 10. First because it was freaking hard to actually enjoy the fighting scenes because they were so out of focus ( The movie was clear and sharp until the fighting scenes) They moved to fast and from one side of the screen to the other. As a fan I could not appreciate the action at all. Secondly, the plot was really bad, nothing to do with what we grew up (I understand is a new era but at least make the story interesting) And finally too many dumb ass jokes, what was the director thinking? Would had rather waited to see on DVD than to waste money in the theater. Just another average movie, this summer has really been a let down. Hopefully for the sequel they improve the plot and make it a more part of the story than just fancy graphics.","Jul 21, 2007",6,/10
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Geeky Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) lives with his parents and has an impossible crush on a pretty girl at his school named Mikaela (Megan Fox.) But it's not all bad as his father is treating him to his first ever car- unfortunately it's a seemingly junky old Volkswagon. But unbeknownst to Sam, it's just one of the Autobots- good 'transformers', lead by Optimus Prime, that have landed on earth for a showdown with the bad 'transformers'- the decepticons, lead by the evil Megatron, for a showdown that has been brewing for centuries.As soon as I saw those Citroen car adverts with the car that transforms into a dancing robot, I sat there and thought 'if they can do that for an advert, they could surely make a live action movie of the Transformers', most likely my favourite boyhood kids show. Sure, many people cynically shrugged it off as a cheap marketing gimmick to sell toys, but I loved watching the TV shows and collecting the clever toys that transformed into robots from fire engines, cars, tanks, and many other things. And now many years later it's finally here...Unfortunately it's a very flawed film with more going against it than going for it. It gets better towards the end (getting a trend for Summer blockbusters???) but for the first half we have to endure a clunky script, with banal dialogue and a flimsy story that gives hardly any explanation for who's doing what to whom. If Michael Bay's going to make a habit of making these big films that stretch well over two hours (i.e. this, Bad Boys II) then he needs to at least give the script and the plot a bit more zest and vitality than this.You have to wait a while for them, but when the Autobots do arrive on the scene, they're quite a sight to behold. Optimus Prime is very impressive, colourful and transforms marvellously. They also do Jazz, Ironhide, Bumblebee and another one. They surpassed themselves there, as it must have taken a lot of hard work just to bring Optimus to life so brilliantly. The Decepticons are less impressive, though. They're all very grey and all look rather samey. There's not much depth in the Autobots, either, but they're especially lifeless. I mean, Starscream was such a major part of the TV show, and it was always a big part of the story watching the power struggle between him and Megatron for leadership of the Decepticons. Here he's just an insignificant support character who stands there and lets Megatron berate him (""...you disappoint me as always Starscream!!!"") which the TV Starscream would never have took.The writers have put a lot of emphasis on humour, too. Not a bad thing, of course, but it does get in the way of the story a little sometimes. It's mostly to do with crude sexual inneuendo as well. The 12A certificate wasn't all down to the violence! It could have been worse, I suppose, but for a large part of it, this just felt like a rather soulless and careless long awaited live action version of a show I used to really love. **","Jul 29, 2007",4,/10
"...sigh. First of all, let me preface...I can't stand Micheal Bay. I've been dreading this movie since it was first announced, mainly because as a child of the 80's, I had a good idea of what was going to happen to one of my dearest childhood franchises.Luckily, I was wrong. Aside from some pacing issues in the middle of the film, I actually found it quite enjoyable. So much so, I actually want to see it again. I was even delightfully surprised that they managed to have to robots talk and communicate without making the film completely absurd.Overall, It was a fantastic film, and as long as they can maintain this quality, I look forward to a sequel.Now I can worry about G.I.

"I honestly think i should've been paid to watch this film. The whole thing was the most OTT, product-placement-obsessed, playboy-meets-nerd piece of ""film"" i've ever seen. The CGI was good, yes, but the camera's obsession with being ""in the action"" and being involved in the effects the Transformers have on the mise-en-scene was just so...bloody...annoying. ""Ok...here comes a fight...might be worth the dialogue aimed at 2 year olds, the crap jokes and the apparent pointless-ness of the Transformers themselves so far, what with the bad ones who look all the same doing anything remotely significant and the humans blowing the crap out of the supposedly indestructible metal aliens...oh, no wait.

"The movie is full of sexual dialogue from the main character who is underage. There is also a middle-aged man (about 40) who makes an inappropriate sexual comment towards an underage child, calling her hot while looking at her up and down. It is sick. The producers adds in the most unhinged, perverted dialogue I have ever seen. The main characters are in high school, they do not talk like that. Stop sexualizing underage children and normalizing it. It is disgusting and abhorrent. The way high schoolers and underage kids are portrayed in this movie is disturbing. They are kids, not sexual objects. What is wrong with this movie and the producers? This type of content does not deserve praise, it deserves to be shunned and called out. Please do not watch this with your children. Please be safe and keep your children away from this type of content.","Mar 24, 2024",,
"Every horny mans dream when you look at Megan Fox but with robots. Nowhere near a masterpiece but who really cares..... all the people wanted to see were fighting robots and that's what you get along with corny jokes and stupid innuendos ( Michael Bay's vision). Though a little average, it does have a plot, Optimus and his soldiers must rescue a cube in order to keep Megatron from resurrecting some robot building or something to that nature. Though the jokes are corny and childish, the script is far fetched( but its science fiction so who cares) the acting is terrible and the action scenes stole the movie, this is just one of those mindless movies where you just fire up your stereo ( subs are a must for this, if you only have 1, GET 5 MORE), sit back, throw your brain out the window and enter retard mode because once you see the action in this film, you will scream MEGATRONNN!!!!!!!!","Jun 24, 2010",6,/10
"Unlike the following several, this one has legendary humor. Along with the 1986 film, this is an outstanding masterpiece. Unlike some of the subsequent films, this one features some well-written human characters that are both interesting and entertaining. The photography is superb and the film appears to be really stylish. The narrative revolves on a teenage boy and his car works surprisingly well and feels like many of the more classic Steven Spielberg films such as Jurassic Park or E. T. The dialogue is really good and Glen is very relatable. I think that the way they portray the Decepticons in this movie as absolute hulking unstoppable beasts that you need to work together to defeat was really cool. The designs for the transformers are menacing and aesthetically pleasing. All in all there's a lot more than meets the eye to this film!","Aug 31, 2021",10,/10
"One of Orson Welles last film roles was The Transformers Movie, an animated film in 1986. It was regarded as a low point to go out on. However in the cinematic world the name Transformers have been transformed thanks to Michael Bay kick starting the franchise and the original is the best so far.Direction wise this has all the Bay trademarks, swirling photography, stirring music and pumping action scenes with state of the art CGI. There is even some sly digs at the all powerful government agencies abusing the extent of their powers.The plot is straightforward. Shia Labeouf is a nerd who buys a car that transforms to a robot, his grandfather once made a discovery and now two gangs of robots are beating the hell out of each other. The autobots led by Optimus Prime are the good guys. The bad guys are the Decepticons and they are after the cube of power called the All Spark. The film is not as flimsy and indulgent as the sequels. There is plenty of action, explosions and humour in this one and it all blends well to be a good popcorn film.","Mar 12, 2015",7,/10
"because it was so entertaining. I finally saw Transformers and it was much better than I thought it would be. The special effects were awesome. The robots looked real, as though taking up space. I also loved how they incorporated lots of humor. That's what made the movie for me. From the songs the car picks to play with Sam and Mikaela, to the sector 7 agent, and Anthony Anderson. To many funny scenes to name. Humor plus action makes for great film, especially if it has a long running time. This movie used the same formula that made Spiderman so great.I liked the lead actors in this. In a action movie, you usually don't really care for them, but Shia and Megan work great in this. It's been a while since I've seen a 2 plus hour movie that didn't seem like it was way too long. One criticism I had was at times, it was just too loud, a signature of Michael Bay films. Tone down the hard rock music.FINAL VERDICT: Great action flick. Check it out.","May 14, 2008",9,/10
Overall the first Transformers film is a pretty good movie. The acting is pretty decent there's a cool concept and seeing robots battle it out is pretty fun. I really don't have anything bad to say or anything great to say about the film. It's just a fun movie to watch!,"Jun 25, 2020",7,/10
"That's right. The chick was gorgeous, and she (and of course the director) showed her assets quite well. Look, I am not a womanizer but when this is deliberately shown I of course cannot stop noticing it. In a nutshell this movie was written by teenagers for teenagers.Silly, nonsense talk, mom and dad trying hard to look stupid on screen,over-trusting secretary of state who gives the power to the teenagers, secret robots buried under the Hoover dam (because of the thousands of tons of concrete as explained), the over-powerful US tactical aviation able to destroy the alien robots, etc, etc. Well, probably I am grown up (30) and can't and won't see such movies. I know that I will be probably nailed for my review, but hey, I am prepared to take it. This is what I characterize as a money making product with good present value of its discounted cash flows. Nothing else.","Aug 11, 2007",1,/10
"As a non-Transformer fan...a non-viewer of the cartoons, a non-reader of the comics, and a non-collector of the toys...I wasn't planning to see the movie until recently. The stylish trailer shots of giant robots in battle got me interested. I also had an inkling that Michael Bay would give this one his all, because after The Island he would know his career couldn't afford another flop. And after seeing Pirates 3 and Spidey 3 not live up to expectations, I figured the law of averages was in favor of Transformers being the best sci-fi action epic of the year.I was not disappointed. In fact I was pleasantly surprised at how successful the movie was with its human characters and how much humor it found at all levels of its story. It is so, so difficult for a sci-fi film like this to pull off real genuine, gut-busting humor without descending into camp or disrespect. Part of that is because the filmmakers have to be really brave to try for laughs when they're already afraid the audience will laugh at unconvincing effects or unbelievable story lines. This movie goes on a short list with Superman, Ghostbusters, and Men in Black as one of the funniest sci-fi action films ever made. Shia LaBeouf in both comedic and dramatic scenes was a wonderful asset here. My faith in Spielberg having made the right choice casting him in Indy 4 was given real credence here.If the movie had one major weakness it was that the villains don't get the development the humans and heroes do. Aside from Scorponok's awesome desert battle and perhaps a bit too much of the little Gremlin-bot's antics we don't get to see the villains display much personality. I think Megatron had less screen time than the Gremlin-bot. That weakens the drama of the final battle because it seems like the Autobots are just fighting mindless machines, ones that we don't quite understand the full capabilities and motivations of. I think we needed more scenes of the Decepticons planning and plotting together to parallel the scenes of the Autobots meeting and introducing each other. And we needed at least one scene where Megatron demonstrates a seriously bad-ass show of force BEFORE he starts fighting the good guys, a la Magneto's bridge attack in X3 or just about everything General Zod does in Superman 2 before the Metropolis battle. Speaking of missed opportunities, I'm not sure why you take us to a major national landmark in a movie like this unless you intend to blow it up.Other than the whole enterprise sort of unraveling in a final battle that is more dramatically and visually choppy than anything that came before it, this movie was full of pure entertainment. I loved the Herbie-esquire chemistry between Bumblebee and the kids. I had fun with the Christine-esquire suspense when the cars began showing their threatening side and all of the zippy car chases that followed. I enjoyed Optimus Prime's heroic Jor-el-esquire speeches about the good in humanity. I thought Voight as the Rumsfeld character and Turturro as the shadow government guy added solid acting presence and weight to the movie. I liked the human comedy of Shia's romantic and family problems, the geeky in-joke computer references, and the giant robot-slapstick comedy, which I still think was perhaps the movie's most impressive and unlikely achievement. And I thought the transformation effects had all the necessary cool factor. One bad moment, I didn't like the explanation for the origin of earth's technology. That was unnecessary plot overkill and too Terminator-esquire. And Bernie Mac's cameo only served to illustrate how much better the movie's subtler and more unexpected attempts at comedy were.I think this movie will deservedly earn its place as the #1 box-office smash of the year, besting Spider-Man 3's $335 million gross. It may also have earned a special place in cinema history for crediting both a ""Product Placement Coordinator"" and a ""Military Adviser,"" in that order. Now I look forward to a sequel where I hope the robots, especially the villains, earn more screen time, dialogue, and character development. I think we're ready for that now that we humans have made a successful transition into the robot world by virtue of this introductory movie. For now, I'll be eyeing up those Transformers movie toys a lot closer while contemplating the potential of a post-Christmas clearance sale...and I'll keep watching the skis, uh, skies, uh, highways....","Jul 6, 2007",8,/10
"I had some interest in hearing that there was going to be a live Transformers film and I wanted to sit down and watch it. I heard Peter Cullen would return as Optimus Prime but after watching the film I felt that was the only redeeming factor. That and the special effects. What went wrong? Michael Bay put in a bunch of corny jokes and went overboard on the special effects. There was little story and I'm not sure the sequels were needed. But this was decent for last decade and while it changed a lot it had its moments. If you're a TF fan and liked the original cartoon, stick with that. If you like Michael Bay, try it. If you want something true to the original, steer clear. A lot has changed in the past decades.","Jul 2, 2018",6,/10

If you're ever wondering how to identify a Michael Bay movie just watch for people entering or exiting military aircraft in slow motion with way-too-dramatic music piped in.I'm pretty sure this will hold the title of worst adaptation of an 80's cartoon ever made....until John Woo's ""The Snorks"" comes out.

"What is easily the best non sequel movie of the summer. Transformers is the most action packed, fun thrill ride of a movie I have seen in many years. I saw an 11:40 pm screening of this movie at the Arclight Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, with a sold out crowd.This movie is better than I could have ever imagined. I have always enjoyed Bay's flair for flash and trash, this guy should have directed Miami Vice. He knows cars, and car chases better than anyone today. and this movie is no different. Action scenes so packed you have to see it again just to grasp it all. Great pacing between a national security storyline and a boy and his car, woven perfectly together.The movie is fun, over the top and funny in all the right places. Megan Fox is the resident hot chick and the entire movie plays to the inner teenager in all of us. My only regret is my 2 year old son is not old enough to view this with me.The first movie I'll be seeing a second time in the theater!best movies thus far:Transformers Die Hard 4 Knocked Up Pirates 3 Spidy 3","Jul 5, 2007",9,/10
"Transformers (2007) *** (out of 4) Bay's action blockbuster pretty much delivers everything you'd expect from this type of film. A teen (Shia LaBeouf) doesn't realize that he's actually got a connection to a couple alien races who are about to come to Earth and do battle. The good guy Autobots need the help of the teen so that they can locate a certain device that will allow them to defeat their rivals the Decepticons. I personally can't understand all the heat that Bay takes because the man isn't trying to deliver CITIZEN KANE type films but instead he wants to make popcorn movies that are loud and feature plenty of explosions and I really can't think of anyone who does it better. I've hated some of his films but on the whole I've enjoyed many and that includes this film, which is about as silly as you can get but who cares? The main reason to watch a film like this is for the action scenes and Bay certainly knows how to deliver. Right from the start we're introduced to some loud explosions and they never really let up through the 142-minute running time. The special effects are mighty impressive with the robots constantly changing form and I must say that they really looked great. The most impressive thing is that they're able to take this CGI creations and make them look real. I'm not really a fan of CGI because I feel it often times looks so fake that it takes you away from the real stuff on the screen but that never happens here as Bay knows how to mix the fake CGI with the real actors and action. One of the most impressive scenes is at the end when the robots, the Army, various government agents and of course our hero teen are all battling in the streets from the ground to the top of the sky-scrappers and this entire sequence just contains one thrill after another. The earlier action scenes are all impressive as well including one bit where LaBeouf and his love interest (Megan Fox) find themselves being chased through the streets not knowing what they've got themselves involved in. LaBeouf is always hit and miss with me but I think he served this character well as he had no problems playing the ""dork"" early on and he was also quite believable as the action hero. Fox certainly can't act but she's not here to win an Oscar. She's here to look hot and she does that just fine. The supporting cast has a lot of familiar faces including Bernie Mac, Jon Voight, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. I think the movie could have been better had Bay gotten rid of some of the supporting characters and I'd say the entire bit with the platoon could have been left on the editing room floor. I also think some of the rather obnoxious comedy could have been left out including the bits with the parents who are constantly embarrassing their son. Outside of those things, TRANSFORMERS is a pretty impressive action flick that knows it's an action flick and it doesn't try to be anything else. There's plenty of buildings that explode and get ripped apart and it's this type of action that fans want and Bay delivers more than enough for one film.","May 29, 2011",,

"Seeing the previews I wasn't sure I would like the film beyond the effects. The effects looked amazing, and they truly were. However the film was actually a lot of fun. No wonder Michael Bay did Victoria Secret commercials, the man knows what is hot. The cars, the chick, the shots, the music, all very hot.The first half of the movie is actually really good. It's got great comedy, great acting, great music, and great mix of stories. It's paced well, shot well and contagious. The second half left a bit to be desired. The dialogue between Optimus and Sam was a bit lame and too filled with positive messages for kids, as was the dialogue between Optimus and Megatron. They could have gotten the same message across in less cheese. In addition, the fight sequences between the robots were not nearly as cool as everyone wants them to be. While the effects are good and life-like, the coverage of the fights left a lot to be desired. Not only was it hard to see the actual fight, the fighting wasn't even that cool. You know you're not alone in this when in the beginning the whole audience is cheering, and by the end you hear the odd ""whoo"" and that's it. With that said, we all clapped at the end because it really was a cool film with great characters that you want to watch.

"From the moment i saw the teaser trailers, and noticed Micheal Bay (Pearl Harbour & The Island director), I was going to see this movie indefinitely. Plus, executive produced by Stephen Spielberg which influenced me more. I was anticipating this would be a real blockbuster.I questioned myself whether it might be quite a let down, due to over excessive amounts of money put into it. But was i sure wrong! From start to finish i was entertained! Terrific acting from Shia LaBeouf who has been doing great with his career (Disturbia is his next summer blockbuster) and also the wonderful Megan Fox, who, in which many gentleman will agree, is a girl you would drop everything to look at her.The special effects were excellent, the best I've seen yet, especially the transformation of the robots (which are the main point about the transformers franchise). The only let down, is that there isn't much emphasis on the characters. Sure, it does start off as a steady drama and does show the life of Sam Witwicky, which escalates when he meets hot chick Mikaela Banes who is most obviously infatuated by her. But yes the balance of personality of the characters and the action is just too bias. Near to the end you kind of think, ""what's going on?"" you get a bit confused with all the quick action, you're just overfed with action, and sometimes does get rather annoying. There are some quirky, witty and humorous moments in the film which gives it a more happier tone to the movie.All in all this is one great film, and i recommend it to all! Well done Spielberg and Bay!","Aug 17, 2007",7,/10
"Loved the movie. Great visual effects, but some scenes are too close. fight scenes between transformers too close to see it, and you get lost on who is who, or who gets hit.If you want to make a statement that they are big, but zoom out to recognize a fight, at least make some cars nearby for people to compare. Also I want to put this in FAQ's but too cheap to pay for membership. *spoiler*When they have a test of the AllSpark's power with the nokia... Whouldn't the machine that gets touched with the power of the AllSpark that relays the energy to the nokia get turned into a transformer also???*end spoiler*","Aug 9, 2008",9,/10

"This is written from the point of view of someone who was never interested in Transformers, and watched the movie because it had a high rating on IMDb.If you don't like comic books, you will hate this movie. Sure, there are pretty girls, but they are acting as if robots are humans. The acting in this movie is a huge letdown. It's as if Disney has made one single movie that combines the terrible features of all of their movies, added robots, and released it.If you enjoy comic books, Transformers type stuff, you may be interested to see how it is depicted in a film once more, but don't get too excited.If you liked The Matrix, this movie may not be for you, the robots look just like robots, yet the movie asks you to look at them as humans, and this is what bugs me. They have cheesy deep voices, and this film is full of over-used robot humor.After seeing this film, I almost feel like everyone in the movie was a robot, they all acted as if they had no emotions whatsoever, and no touch with humanity. Even the main character is so see-through that it makes the whole film feel like a joke to me.Towards the end there are so many inconsistencies that it would take a lot of alcohol not to notice them. Just an example (NOT A SPOILER): A main character states something to the effect of ""if those were our planes they wouldn't fly lower than the buildings"". 5 minutes later, their planes are flying just a couple hundred feet over the ground in a big city.It's things like this that could easily be fixed, but absolutely ruin the movie for all of us. It's almost as if the director never actually watched the movie all the way through, or didn't care enough to fix any of the problems.Sorry Transformers fans, I respect your passion, but this movie was still terrible.","Dec 25, 2007",1,/10
I thought the film was great action flick it was something I have been waiting for all summer. It gave a good setup for Autobot city to be built in the next movie and for Megatron to return and build his underwater base. It also opens up possibilities of the dinobots being built in the next film along with devastator.The movie had a good running time of 2 hours and 24 minutes but I keep wondering if their is a lot more that was cut from this film that would of really flush out character and story development. Does anyone know how long the original cut of this film ran and what was cut out?,"Jul 7, 2007",10,/10

"What can I say? Okay me me rephrase that, what can I say nice? The actors aren't bad. The CGI looks okay...in the trailer.Soulless unfunny big screen live action disaster based on the cartoon series. Michael Bay rapes the American public once again.This is awful.How bad? My dad fell asleep and I kept moaning this is awful this is awful.I think one reviewer claimed something about this being a sign of the Apocalypse. I believe him. This is proof that most people want form over content and bread and circus' over anything meaningful.The plot is something like the Decepticons trying to find a cosmic cube or spark or something so they can rule the world. The Autobots- who mostly don't show up until an hour in are also trying to find it but to protect man kind. I don't know, I don't care.Don't get me wrong this is well made trash. It looks good, even if the CGI is never fully integrated into the film. Yet again we have these cool looking effects that seem unconnected with the people. Why are effects getting worse and worse? 200 million dollars and you can tell that the transformers are not with the people.The problems mostly lie in the script. First off the movie is wildly silly, even the parts that are not suppose to be ""funny"". What can I say its so over the top as to be laughable. The comedy is dumb in a TV sitcom sort of way.Then again this is coming from a TV cartoon so it makes perfect sense. Worse a good many of the actors mug and play their roles for laughs for much of the early parts of the film so that when it comes time to be serious you don't believe them. There is no tension because you don't believe there is any real danger...or anything that is connected to reality. I never once believed this was real-or possible. No one acted nor did the plot spin out in anything other than the sort of reality found on second rate TV shows or movies.I think the choices to play to the fans and keep things close to the TV show-using some of the voices hurt the believability of much of the film. Sure the scorpion thing looks cool and a few others seem plausible, but Optimus Prime just looks really stupid when placed in the real world.and yet its well made. On some technical level this is a ""good"" movie. Not good enough to recommend it...but good on some scale of proficiency.I'm at a loss for words-really.What a waste this is. Its just an incredibly stupid movie.","Aug 26, 2007",3,/10
"Being 35 years old, I spent many of hours with my eyes planted on the cartoon series. Before going to see this movie I was VERY worried that this was going to be another blown opportunity at making a movie based on one of my childhood shows, of which there are many horrible examples! I'm not easy to please.First of all, one must realize that there will ALWAYS be some discrepancies between the old shows and a new movie. Also we must remember that no one is going to make a movie unless there is a chance at making money. You just cannot judge a movie if you're determined to nitpick before you view it. A lot of the negativity is coming from people that expect perfection and go into a movie looking for reasons to be dissatisfied.People have complained about everything from the high velocity twisting when transforming to the paint jobs. I mean c'mon, get over it! It's a modern interpretation of the old show, ITS NOT THE CARTOON SERIES.Overall I thought the movie was great. It was packed with high action graphics and humor. The first battle scene was awesome! The cameras were set a bit too close on some scenes, either to put the images more in your face or to hide imperfections. The characters (robot) personalities were not entirely true to the old show but extremely close. The heroic and self sacrificing nature of autobots was left intact as well as the dark nature of the decepticons. A few of them got wasted but remember this is Transformers, anyone can come back, and the movie definitely left room for the future.I left feeling extremely pleased with the movie. To see it in this modern form was a real pleasure. I can confidently say that Hollywood managed to avoid crushing another one of my childhood joys. It is one of the best movie remakes I've seen and I'm glad they did it. I look forward to taking my kids to see it so they can share in the same story that I loved as a kid.Go see it! At the very least, it's worth the ticket price.","Jul 5, 2007",9,/10
"When I went to see Transformers I was expecting the worst.Another film based on a cartoon series! And it was for the kids, so the Transformers have been all good, and the evil Decepticons were simply evil. And Michael Bay as a director, most of his movies are pretty bad to my mind (Armageddon, Pear Harbor, Bad Boys, The Island). Perfect ingredients for another cinema-disaster.But I liked the Transformer-cartoons, so I had to watch.What a surprise. The main theme is not really about the robots, but about a teenager and his (of course) problems with first love. This theme is told with a lot of humor and irony, making it bearable and in fact entertaining.The robots add to the fun and deliver the action, otherwise no one would watch the film. Very good effects and a nicely dry tone of storytelling make this good fun too.So it is not a great movie. But it is entertaining and worth the money. If, and only if you like brainless teenage-sci fi-a lot of things getting blown up-movies.","Dec 31, 2007",6,/10

"While no one will mistake Michael Bay for making something intelligent or well-acted, they were at least watchable the whole way through. But Bay, the God of summer action movies' (Jerry Bruckheimer) favorite director, has made his weakest film yet. The first half of the movie is so dumb it's nearly unwatchable (maybe its because Bruckheimer isn't producing...). The dialogue is bad, the characters do stupid things, and stuff sometimes just doesn't make sense. Fortunately, however, the movie gets better around the 45 minute mark. It's not smarter, but it's actually entertaining. This is especially crazy since Steven Spielberg is an executive producer. Then again, he ""sold out"" a while ago, and is now more of a producer than a director.The story is completely absurd, but hey, it's a sci-fi movie, so of course it's going to be. Anyway, there are two warring alien races who are machines, the Autobots (the good guys) and the Decepticons (the bad guys). They bring their battle to earth because there's an all-powerful box called the Allspark there, and it could either bring peace, or destroy humanity and give the Decepticons control of the universe.The acting is okay, I guess, but no one is developed at all. Half the people are only memorable because we know their faces from other movies. Shia LeBeouf is immensely likable, so we care about seeing him through the movie. He's no different here than in any other movie he's been in, but he has an irresistible charm that does the job. Surprisingly, Megan Fox is not around just for good looks. She can act, and nearly steals every scene she's in. Jon Voight is awful, however. It's one of the worst performances he's ever given. Josh Duhamel is adequate, but not memorable. Jon Turturro is fun to watch as the of-the-wall secret agent. Tyrese Gibson is completely wasted in this movie.I really hate the Shaky Cam technique. For those of you who don't know, it's where the camera moves around a lot during an action scene so you can't get a good look at what's going on. Used effectively, it can heighten the suspense. ""The Descent"" is a case in point. The technique heightened the claustrophobia because it heightened the sense of being trapped in the dark and fighting monsters the characters couldn't see. But in ""Transformers,"" there's no use for it. Michael Bay used it probably because it is the trend, and, taking a note from Jerry Bruckheimer, he's never one to pass up on something that has already made money before.However, Bay is not a versatile director. He's good for filming action scenes, but not much else. He can't keep the material straight, and that's a problem because there are a lot of things going on simultaneously. With Bay's inadequate direction, characters come and go as the story demands it, and the rules that the film established are broken repeatedly and new ones are made. It's a mess.However, I'd be lying if I said ""Transformers"" is a terrible movie. It's no masterpiece (it's not even especially good). But it's watchable.Will I see the sequel? I guess, if I have nothing better to do. Because the film left me with that thought, I'll be generous with its rating.","Jun 11, 2009",6,/10
"Firstly, I'm no Transformers fan. I have absolutely no idea what the Transformers universe was based on or what the cartoons were about. I cannot, therefore, relate this movie to the cartoons.I have, however, heard of Transformers when I was a kid from commercials and watching some cartoons here and there. When I heard about the coming of this film, I honestly thought it would be sort of corny.......BOY was I WRONG! This film brought back the sensation of ""Damn those humans have nnnoooo idea what they're dealing with!!"" just as it was brought in with the ""Aliens"" movie. The CGI was astoundingly realistic. I don't think I've ever seen graphics so convincing since ""The Matrix"". The transformations the Transformers undertook was incredible. They seamlessly transform from vehicles to their full forms. And during combat, these transformations brought the bullet-time moments as was in ""The Matrix"". For those familiar with ""Armageddon"", they'll feel the same feelings when watching this film.....The only thing I really didn't like with this film is that the BIG brawl between the Autobots and the Decepticons took place in a city.....which gives a really uncomfortable claustrophobic feel considering these Transformers are large and need some room. Had the setting been more larger, I'm sure the audience would've appreciated the fights more. However, this downside is replaced with lots of damage and explosions that appeal to the eye.Other than that, ""Transformers"" is a terrific film. Its the kind of film that I could watch more than once. I honestly don't know why some people gave this film horrible reviews but.......after all, not all movies taste good to others.....at least, I certainly enjoyed this one!!!","Jul 16, 2008",9,/10
"Transformers is brought by the director Michael Bay. He is well known for Bad Boys, The Rock This film tends to lead to a direction of mindlessly entertainment and enjoyment. As we've come to expect, robot's destructions and combats, we do get these aspects in veritable satisfaction. Michael Bay is well known for chaotic, blotchy destruction that gets convoluted or diverting. Either way, this film embraces these that makes the yet the best Transformers film out of the series.Transformers follows a young teenage boy who wants to buy his first car ever. Meanwhile, a conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons intensify as they strive to retrieve 'The Cube' that can transform any material into a biological metal being. Sam (Shia LaBeouf) perchance buys a car that tends to be a transformer as he gets yanked into a situation that can redeem the human race with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). As the plot is simple enough, it is equitable for this type of film. Audiences do not bother about the plot being splendidly the prime. Most of the audiences crave great and astonishing robot actions. We fulfill these aspects from the film. Evenly, the visuals are marvelous. The CGI is flawless as it is the fundamental requirement and it looks precisely realistic. The sound is spotlessly well crafted. There is a gracious finish to the sound as the immaculately designed cars transform into frantic robots. However, the characters are very poorly scripted and executed. They are notably unrealistic and sometimes facedly annoying. Although frenetic robot actions are stunning and frigid to look at, flat characters still bother the film to a negative sideward. Shia LaBeouf is surprisingly tolerable as the teenage boy who is mentally junior. Megan Fox is usual, she is adequate but faulty at some acting. The acting is just adequate or exceptional in terms of big action flicks like this. Overall, Transformers is the film you may or may not have expected the outcome to be. It may entertain you or find the movie to be boring and disappointing. In my opinion, I was still entertained through all the years and gave chances for the sequels to be superior enough. As fans have said, 'Michael Bay, you still suck but we still love you.'Grade: B","Aug 2, 2017",7,/10
"If you keep brain this movie is not worth watching. I am a big fan of movies like Terminator 2, and Matrix series and Star Wars. But this one is meaningless crap. Just a lot of visual and computer graphics added meticulously. But this movie is meant for only children below the age of 10. The beginning is awful that there was a cube which contained all the powers of the universe. And bad robots escaping from the far galaxy. And how hundreds of years ago the code was entered into the mountaineers grandfather specs. These are all very childish these stories are not going to impress any one any more, as there was time for Spider man and Superman. But Spiderman and Superman are also finished because something in the comics and imagination gives you more pleasure than watching it in the complete reality (Except something like Jurassic Park).","Nov 16, 2007",1,/10

"I just can't understand how this movie can get 8,4 (this is the score it has after more than 10,000 votes; I guess it will get lower later). Of course the movie has been released only some days ago; there must be studio guys who want to sell their product. But I guess there are also fans who enjoyed this movie very much. Good for them. I don't say I hated it but I really can't understand the hype. This movie consists of three types of scenes: Teen movie - these parts do work (even if the girl is too hot for being believable); nothing special but okay (while the humor is really not that great). 6/10 spectacular non-action sequences - they are the best part, maybe 10/10. The robots look really great, the effects are superb, the story is alright (yes you have to suspend belief to enjoy seeing the size differences when transforming - not only the transformers but the cube as well - but if you can't suspend your belief when watching a movie about giant robots you are helpless). These scenes really show Spielberg is the producer. action sequences - they are totally Michael Bay. But not his finest (like The Rock) but his most maniac. Yes, the movie is fast, spectacular and loud, but these scenes are simply too much; in the end these even started to bore me as hell. If Bay was able limit himself and not include endless boring sequences of loud, mindless and superfluous destruction, that would have helped the movie very much; these sequences are 4/10 for me. (sorry; I am not a Bay-hater - even if Pearl Harbor was terrible - but it is strange to find the action scenes to be the weakest part of a Bay action movie.)","Jul 5, 2007",6,/10
"This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Comparable only too the Thin Red Line -- and Wind Talkers. The script/plot is non-existent, and the way Shia LaBeouf acts on screen is a cookie cut of his time as Louis Stevens. Aside from a few visually entertaining moments the movie was a complete waste of time. A lot of the transitions in setting leave you wondering ""why are they here?"" ""Who is that girl, and why is she British working in the NSA?"" ""Why are the Autobots on Mars at one point?"" I could gripe about this movie for a few paragraphs ,but I am more or less witting this in hopes of deterring one person from wasting their money in as few words as possible. If you fit in the category of middle America that enjoys seeing barrels and building explode; I highly recommend this film to you!

"To the people who are saying this is the best movie they've ever seen: You need to see more movies. Seriously.And to the people who are saying this is the worst movie they've ever seen: Again, you need to see more movies, because if you've never come across anything worse than this, you clearly don't watch very many.The story in general is pretty cheesy and very clichéd - the hot girl who goes out with the superficial hunk but then dumps him for the nerdy hero because there's ""more to her than meets the eye"", the evil secret agent chaps, determined to stick to the rule-book, the die-hard soldiers with the ""be brave! you're a soldier now kid!"" speech... all that. But don't lay into how silly that story is if you're going to defend the story of the transformers, which is, let's face it, pretty stupid to begin with. ""Our world was created by a powerful artifact, then destroyed by the evil robots who want to use it's power for evil, so we threw it into space to stop them, now we've come here to stop them again because we're the awesome good robots, defenders of mankind""... oh please.At this point, you might be thinking I hated the movie, but you'd be wrong - it was awesome entertainment. The transformers are great, the action scenes are great, the music is great, Megan Fox is a fox (ahahaha like that pun hasn't been done a million times already), the nerdy-bloke-wins-fair-lady's-heart story is feel-good fun, there's plenty of laughs. Just take it as it is - light-hearted entertainment - and don't look too deeply, because it's not trying to be a deep film.","Aug 5, 2007",8,/10
"Michael Bay brings the classic Hasbro toy collection ""Transformers"" to the big screen. The only plot this movie contains is just a bunch of walking and talking robots, battling and fighting, and the only necessary plot is action, duh! ""Transformers"" is a movie that is expressed in both positive and negative reactions. Negative thoughts - Michael Bay brought too much for this movie, turning him into a terrible director. The action was too much for me, the cinematography is too fast, the editing is annoying, and the script is stupid and unrealistic. Positive thoughts - Shia LaBeouf, although he acts like a jerk throughout, he still makes a pretty good performance. Megan Fox did alright in her performance in this movie, but she and LaBeouf don't really show a lot of chemistry between them. The sound is dazzling, the visual effects are astounding, some moments were funny, some members of the cast I liked, and the Optimus Prime character was powerful and enjoying. Now, I'm not saying that ""Transformers"" is either the greatest or the worst movie ever made. It's an alright movie with too much action and way less story, but it sometimes manages to thrill you, even though it's mostly annoying. Besides that, it's a movie that is perfect summer entertainment for your kids, and I thought it was pleasant, in a both enjoying and annoying way.

It seemed like there was just enough romance, comedy and drama to satisfy all moviegoers. But the actions sequences were really the amazing stuff. I would highly recommend seeing this movie. Also, as an old school fan, I was not mad at how they portrayed the transformers or other characters, nor did I nitpick about plots not synching up.

"7 July 2007. Overall, this movie is a bit of puzzle, and the lack of clear consistent directing is evident from what appears to be a script that seems to have been written by several different writers with different ideas as to what this movie should have been about. While most of the production values and cinematic photographic and sound effects are powerful and compelling, they can't make up for the apparent collapse of the movie midway in where what appeared to a be a fairly serious Carpenter's remake of ""The Thing"" (instead of living beings turning into monsters we have here things turning into monsters - almost as scary), the movie transforms partway into a more dumbed down version of juvenile lightness and then back to seriousness. There are the obvious emotional buttons pushed where a little girl is faced with a big bad monster, we have a little monster that is both cute and wicked like a ""Gremlin."" There are several logical gaps and unbelievable lapses in reasonable belief that distract from the movie. In total, this movie could have been a lot better, one of the best of the year (quite notable for this genre), but instead we are held to a collage of different subplots and sometimes add up to confusion and a dizzying array of special effects that take away from the solid underlying theme of the movie.

"I was very excited to see a live action movie about Transformers. However I was disappointed with the results. It seems like the movie about robots wasn't really centered around the robots. While this might have been to give the movie a more human touch, it ruined it for me. Again it's a movie about robots and their interactions with humans not the other way around.The good: *The robots were cool looking (hey, this is a movie about robots) *some of the human robot interactions were masterfulThe bad: *The action sequences were many times too close up, it was hard to tell who was fighting who, and when you could tell who was fighting who it was hard to tell what was going on. * This movie should have been 40 minutes shorter, much of the plot was aimed at bringing inconsequential characters more screen time and did not move the story along. *the cheese factor: it seems like they couldn't decide if they wanted this movie to be serious or cheesy, so they said ""oh let's go for a little of both"" (e.g. the transformer introductions, or the whole ""bedroom"" scene) *The character build-up is so poor that you don't care what happens to most of them (the people not the transformers)","Jul 7, 2007",5,/10
"I first saw the title listed under Shia LaBeouf's name on this site about a year ago. All I knew about the Transformers was that they had thoroughly awesome team symbols and they turned into vehicles and that I was very inept at switching back and forth between the vehicle and the robot in the toys (I broke them and I still do.). That was about it. I only knew those because my brother got one or two about every Christmas. So I saw this movie under Shia Labeouf's movie listings in ""Pre-Production"", and thought ""Oh man...I sense a bad one. It's probably gonna be animated."" Then I forgot all about it.A few months later, sitting in a movie theater (I think it was POTC 3...I can't remember, the preview was better than the movie if I forgot about it already.). Anyhoo, I think it was the scene with Scorponok and seeing Optimus that really sold me with ""OK...this looks cool!"" It also looked like there would be plenty of car chases & explosions, and there didn't look like there would be much kissing (which I was INSANELY happy about...I HATE long kiss scenes & sappy stuff...I admit I'm a girl, but action has more in it for me.) I took my 7-year-old cousin to see it with me, and I never sit up front or in the median between the front and back sections (far-sighted) but i made an exception cuz this movie was so damn awesome. It was the MOST INCREDIBLE MOVIE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!! Scorponok is THE EXTREME BADASS ROBOT!!!My siblings watched the Kid's Choice Awards on Nickelodeon last night, and I believe that the children and/or teens of America are idiots.

"This movie was very interesting to watch. It prompts you that Air Force is a great career if you so choose to join it. The reason I mention this is because the human defense systems which were the army, navy and especially the air force helps the autobots to fight the decepticons. You realize that the power of technology made by the human race can also be used by the outside worlds and the cube as such. President Hoover had constructed a dam to hide Megatron and the cube which was classified above top secret and to come up with such an idea, shows us the idealistic thinking of a human mind. I am talking about the author of Transformers. 'Transformers' a comic book, and transformed into a high graphic movie shows us the vast scope of animation in the present world. So now we are talking about two careers. This movie can motivate to either join the armed forces or to become an animator which are so darn cool. Coming to the actors. Although Megan Fox looks stunning because of her artificial face, her acting doesn't seem to meet the movie's expectations. On the other hand, the other roles are just brilliant. Octupus Prime teaches you leadership and humility. I usually watch movies above 8 rating on IMDb but this movie was an exception because of the fact that its COOL.","Jun 27, 2011",7,/10

"I was invited to this movie by my friend, and I has no intention of going to Transformers, hating the cartoon. I decided to except his offer to be kind, and expected a totally stupid movie like the TV show. I was stunned. It felt as if Micheal Bay totally changed the storyline, with the All-Spark added instead of pointless battles for the galaxy. Not only did Micheal make the storyline more decent, he also made a lot of characters that were actually quite likable, or appreciable.The storyline like I mentioned, was actually made so that the battles had purposes instead of random fighting. However, the movie would constantly remind the audience that the All-Spark was the main focus by having Decepticons constantly demand for the All-Spark for world domination. When there aren't any demands though, you completely forget what everyone's fighting for. This isn't a large problem though, you'll still find yourself enjoying the movie thoroughly.The action was great and not shallow or stupid as I imagined. I was completely blown away by the special effects and sound effects. You would be able to see every piece of the cars transforming to take the shape of a giant robot. What's more impressive is that the giant robots collide and throw fists at each other. Not one part of the movie looks fake.The acting was good for the most part with the flawless performance of Shia Labouef. Megan Fox however - was not the greatest actress you could ever find. Dialogue also could have been a little better. Otherwise, these things aren't usually noticeable.Transformers was overall good, it wasn't spectacular, but it was enjoyable to watch. Therefore I give it a ""7"" with the great special effects giving it a score boost. The first Transformers now has gotten me hype for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen!","Jun 7, 2009",7,/10
"I went to see Transformers today.. a little fearful. I had been hearing bad things from critics about the movie. Keep in mind.. Transformers were my bread and butter when I was a kid. Ever since they first came on the scene in the early 80's, I've followed them through their various incarnations. And some of them were just gawdawful. And now it's 2007, 20+ years since the very first series. I loved it. ~There is action from the very first, when Blackout lands in the military base, and you know something bad is coming. And he dishes it out. ~I was afraid that the way Bumblebee communicated would be cheesy.. but it was actually very cute. I liked it. ~You could feel Megatron's contempt for the humans, even uttering 'fleshling' once. Love it. ~The little comedic opportunities by the Autobots weren't awkward either, most were genuinely funny. The different personalities of each Autobot stood out. ~Megan Fox is so hot. ~I didn't like the fact there was one death.. I'll say no more to prevent spoilers. ~Shia was REALLY great in this. He was the quintessential awkward kid who wants to try and get the attention of the local hot babe. In this he's such a great performer, very convincing. And the way he and Bumblebee bonded during the movie was really very touching. When Bumblebee was being captured by Sector 7, very cool. ~Megan Fox is so hot. ~I really need to make comment on Optimus Prime. A lot of people complained about his overall looks (ZOMG WHY DOES HE HAVE The FLAMEZ?!). I happen to like the way he looks, the way they all look now in this redesign. But more than that.. 20 years later, Optimus Prime is STILL the man. He just is. He is the true heroic archetype to me. When Ironhide asks why they need to protect humans (he doesn't see them as worth it at first), Prime speaks with a real wisdom. Over and over he demonstrates just why he's the leader.If you're a fan at all of the Transformers, in any of it's incarnations, I really recommend this movie. Literally everyone I've spoken to who has seen it (9 people and counting) said they love it, and most have seen it at least twice. If you're a fan of big (in scale and cost) movies, then this could be very pleasing for you. It's an unconventional alien invasion movie. Think Independence Day (the non-suckass parts), mixed with some great car chases, the scale of Jurassic Park, and add a little dash of E.T., and you have a summer blockbuster.","Jul 5, 2007",9,/10
"Known for directing some of the greatest classics such as The Bad Boys (1995), A Rocha (1996), Armageddon (1998), Pearl Harbor (2001) and A Ilha (2005), Michael Bay started here the franchise from which he would sediment once and for all name as one of the great directors of action cinema bringing the fictional alien robots from a popular Hasbro franchise, capable of transforming their bodies into innocuous objects like vehicles, to the cinema screens and still counting on the production of Dreamworks by Steven Spielberg. Director Michael Bay, in charge of the direction, was another who did not believe in the potential of the project, but was convinced by Spielberg's vision. This is not a robot film, it is a film of a young man and his first car - inadvertently involved in the middle of a space invasion.For years the Autobots and the Decepticons, two robotic alien races, fought in Cybertron, their home planet. This war caused the planet to be destroyed, resulting in the robots spreading throughout the universe. Megatron (Hugo Weaving), the leader of the Decepticons, comes to Earth in search of Allspark, a Cybertron cube that allows any electronic device to be transformed into a robot with its own intelligence. Megatron finds Allspark, but is frozen in the Arctic. Decades later, other Decepticons arrive on Earth, in an attempt to find Allspark. Its emergence soon alerts the main countries, in particular the United States, which has an attacked military base in Qatar. While Defense Secretary John Keller (Jon Voight) tries to find out what's going on, gathering all possible strength and information, young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has simpler concerns: getting a good grade in school, which will guarantee him Your first car. But what he did not expect was that the chosen vehicle, an old Camaro, had a life of its own.But anyone who thinks ""Transformers"" is just nonstop action is wrong. The great merit in the script by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman is to perfectly blend the comedy in the midst of the action and a main cast that is the soul of the film. It is not easy to act in front of a green screen that will be replaced later by robots ten meters high in practically all the action scenes of the film, but the cast does very well, especially Shia LaBeouf, who plays the main character, Sam Witwicky . The actor ""reacts"" to nothing like nobody before him. The young man screams, feels fear, feels sympathy, runs and interacts with the absent robots with total surrender. Were it not for him, the film would lose half its strength. Not only in the scenes with the robots, but also when interacting with his parents, with Mikaela and even with the military, the actor is the great highlight of the production in his lines and reactions of enormous naturalness.Despite some cinematographic habits worthy of a wedding photo album - can anyone take one more backlit kiss, sunset in the background, in life? - Bay hates blue screens so fashionable in Hollywood. And he hates studio settings even more. His business is to go out on the street with his team, blow up real things - and this predilection for realistic pyrotechnics is a decisive element in the success of ""Transformers"". The beating and chase scenes are extremely exciting, with the right camera in hand - war movie style - and interspersed with absolutely hilarious moments.The comic part is present at all times. The action and comedic moments go hand in hand and support the entire script. The scene of the robots hiding in the garden, while Sam's parents discuss what he was doing locked in the room, is pure Spielberg. And the scene only improves with the knowledge that all the dialogues there were improvised by the trio of actors. We also have the hilarious Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents in several scenes, which in addition to the already commented scene in the bedroom, we have the garden scene in the house, the car purchase scene and even in a post-credit scene with double. To top it off, we still have Bernie Mac, as car salesman Bobby Bolivia and Anthony Anderson, as a super-hacker, putting on a show - the impression (probably correct) is that all the scenes in which he appears are improvised. There is even a hilarious reference to ""Armageddon"" - also directed by Bay - when the Autobots start arriving on Earth.
Another source of laughter is the United States government itself, something very curious, considering that the production had immense support from the country's Armed Forces. George W. Bush and his administration have once again become a joke on more than one occasion - and even lead to acid criticism when the United States mobilizes against North Korea and China before even knowing whether the attack came from them or otherwise. source. But the military should not be too concerned, after all, soldiers receive that glamor that only Michael Bay can give - slow motion cameras, silhouettes carrying weapons in the distance, emotional acts of courage, etc. Everything that works undeniably like military propaganda. Among the most hilarious are those in which the military is being attacked by a Decepticon in the middle of the desert in a real war climate while Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) try to contact the Pentagon and are delayed by bureaucracy by, apparently Indian, in a call center unrelated to the emergency situation that happened on the other end of the line. Even Defense Secretary John Keller (Jon Voight) takes part in some comedy scenes amid suspicions of an attack by some other American enemy and John Turturro (Agent Simmons), responsible for the government's top secret Sector 7, surprising other good guys moments.But who cares about the military, when we have Optimus Prime and Megatron pulling the screws on the big screen? The robots are absolutely sensational, winning thousands of moving parts at the hands of George Lucas' ILM team. As a result, some fans wrinkled their noses, complaining that they look little like their lively counterparts. Nonsense. The result borders on the shocking, with robots changing shape in mid-flight to attack opponents, or even semi-transformed, razing a motorway in mind-boggling pursuits. The level of realism of the robots is practically perfect. We can feel the weight and size of their ""bodies"" when they walk or when they are in combat helped by the fantastic editing and mixing of sounds indicated to Oscar for the work. As if it were not enough to feel the clash of robots as if we were in the middle of battle, the metallic and electronic sounds in communion with the actions of the robots are magnificent.In addition to all this, we have the electrifying soundtrack of Steve Jablonsky (The Island, The Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning) that knows how to increase, decrease, leaving only the sounds of the fighting machines, becoming more urgent or epic depending on the situation. The musical soundtrack including ""What I've Done"" by Linkin Park, ""Before It's Too Late"" by Goo Goo Dolls, ""Doomsday Clock"" by Smashing Pumpkins among others make up the vibrant soundtrack, especially when they were the medium of communication of Bumblebee with humans.While credible characters are hard to come by in ""Transformers"", the effects are staggering and the action is thrilling. And for fans, the writers have reserved numerous surprises, such as classic phrases and hidden clues. Overall, Michael Bay never seems to have had as much fun this time. Unlike other projects where humor is present on a much smaller scale, here the element is essential for us to embark on such a fanciful story and the end result could not be better, having been one of the best adventures of its launch year. Of course, the ending is open, setting the stage for future continuations of one of the most profitable and fun franchises in recent years.","May 24, 2020",7,/10

"first of all, the michael bay's editing has taken a huge amount of flak over the frenetic feel of the action sequences. I would like to point out that the movie was from a human perspective, we see the battles as a bystander would, does it make for as cool a film? Not really, but the objective served it's purpose, it was a decision that added cohesion to the film. All in all it was a great movie that deserves kudos for a conversion that pleases both fans and non-fans alike. My only complaint is that the movie occasionally didn't know whether it should take it's source material seriously or just have fun with it, which is a common problem in many newer comic-book/cartoon based films (especially FF4 and spider-man 3). The film is well done, if you have a gripe, tell me, what would have made it better, cause I see no way bay should have done any differently.","Jul 5, 2007",8,/10
"Transformers, based on the toys of the same name, has a very simple plot. The Autobots led by Optimus Prime square off with the Decepticons led by Megatron. Both are searching for something called the Cube. Their search and war brings them to earth, causing massive destruction. Earth's hope lies in a teen called Sam Witwicky, whose great-grandfather found something buried years earlier.....Directed by Micheal Bay, this has everything you expect from one of his movies: camera's continually on the move, quick-fire editing, and LOUD action sequences. Probably the most surprising thing about it though is that apart from a couple of performances, it's very well acted. The cast, led by Shia LeBouf as Sam are pretty good. The only one who lets the acting side down is John Turturro, as a member of a secret operation known as Sector Seven. But Turturro's performance may be as a result of the script, which has an uneven tone through-out.Let me explain. The movie opens with an attack on a US base in Quatar. It's a well shot and impressive opening, with Bay showing you the CGI transformers in action right from the start. The attack itself is brutal and kills just about everyone. Things calm down for awhile after that as various characters are introduced as the plot evolves. However at times during these moments there is some humour that is at odds with the intensity of the action. Don't get me wrong. Humour in an action movie is always a good thing, but here it's the wrong type of humour. The sequence at Sam's house as he searches for an item that the Autobots need, while they wait outside is the case in point. This is more slapstick humour than, say the humour of a movie like The Rock (another Bay movie), where the dialogue was funny . This brings me back to Turturro. His performance as the agent of Sector Seven tries to be comedic, but it feels like it should be in another movie. A Men In Black approach to Sector Seven would have been better, and funnier than what we get here.The action when it explodes on screen is spectacular. Be it the opening sequence at the airbase in Quatar, to the final battles in the city they are all very impressive, as is the visual CGI by Industrial Light and Magic. The way the human actors blend in with the CGI is stunning, putting them right in the middle of the transformer battles raging round them.The faults with the movie, which as I said lie with the script, are not fatal. For it's running time it's enjoyable, never dull and like all Micheal Bay movies looks stunning, even during the scenes of destruction! The ending leaves the way open for potential sequels. If they can get the tone of the script right, they could have a brilliant follow-up to what is a good summer blockbuster.","Jul 21, 2007",7,/10
"I will fully admit that, even though I'm 37 years old, I have never been a fan of Transformers. Not that there's anything WRONG with Transformers...it's just that it's about 2 things that I have absolutely ZERO interest in: cars and robots. But my 8 year old wanted to see it, and so we did.That being said, and for what it's worth...which probably isn't much based on the preceding paragraph...TRANSFORMERS was one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen.If I were Catholic, I'd feel as though I'd have to go to Confession for having wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life.When TRANSFORMERS 2: TRANSFORM HARDER comes out, I will make sure to miss it.","Nov 9, 2007",1,/10
"Every single thing (except for one) about this movie.. was fantastic. From amazing action to stunning visuals, to ear splitting great sound, Trnasformers was the only summer blockbuster to live up to its hype. When you have movies like SP3 or Pirates that simply did not fully cut the deal, Transformers does. The only problem with this movie is the humor (in some parts). Some of the humor is great, but when there is a serious, basa**, action sequence and you have the robots shoutin out jokes, it makes the serious scenes seem a bit like a joke. Anyways, I have always been a big fan of Transformers, and i must say that this stuck to the cartoon storyline very well and opened up the possibility of future sequels. The voices of the robots were amazing and the sounds used were as well. Seriously, the sound could make the movie in its own. I recommend seeing this more than once for pure entertainment because it does not led up the whole way!!!","Jul 13, 2007",10,/10
"I'm going to do what few have done--I'm going to review the movie, not the director, or the plot holes, or the fact that it's derived from an 80's cartoon genre. I'm going to review THIS MOVIE! The good -- The CGI, fight scenes, and transformations were beautiful. You truly believe that huge robots are turning into vehicles and back again. During the fight scenes, the robots interact seamlessly with their environment. The human acting wasn't too bad either. All the MAIN human characters did well overall and were developed well. They also responded well to the robots who wouldn't ""be there"" during filming.The bad -- All PURPOSEFUL attempts at humor were freaking awful! I moaned much more than I laughed, it was really pathetic, so don't watch this movie for any comedy relief. There were some funny moments, but they were more accidental than planned. My biggest complaint is that, aside from Prime (played PERFECTLY by the great Peter Cullen), none of the other robots had much of a chance to either speak or show their personality other than their endless butt-kicking. I know it was 2 1/2 hrs, but more could have been done to show the personality of the robots other than Prime.Summation -- The humans were there for acting and the robots for fighting. If you see this movie expect something like Starship Troopers, only this time some of the bugs are on our side. My opinion is, if the personalities of the robots would have been taken 1/2 as seriously as the people, this movie would have been excellent. Next time they should let the voice actors develop their characters before making the second movie, then they can have more lines for the robots. Only expect a good performance from Prime, all other characters were wooden and underdeveloped.7/10 for a good effort, it's worth seeing ONCE just for the action. If you're not into huge, beautifully detailed, sentient robots beating each other senseless, it's NOT for you. And no, you don't have to have seen the 80's cartoon to enjoy it.","Jul 7, 2007",7,/10
"I was excited for Transformers to come out after watching all the previews for it online. After I saw it Monday night, I went out and saw it Tuesday again. I'm not typically one to see a movie in the theater multiple times, but I think Transformers is one of those movies where two viewings does it justice.The first time I came into the movie expecting ferocious, giant robot-on-robot violence. I know Michael Bay's track record (I completely avoided ""Pearl Harbor"" and didn't like ""The Island""), so I wasn't expecting much else. After seeing it, my taste for explosions, destruction, and violence was fulfilled (as expected), but the non-robot parts of the movie were entertaining as well. I've been consistently impressed by Shia LaBoeuf and the parents, John Turturro, Bernie Mac, and Anthony Anderson all keep your attention between Autobot-Decepticon battle scenes.The main reason why seeing the movie a second time is so that you can get a second look at the action scenes. The first time I saw it I was positively floored by them; the way the CGI interacts with the environment is stunning. When I saw it the second time, the adrenaline rush was a bit less so I could actually pay attention to what was going on during the battle scenes.This movie won't win any acting or writing Oscars (the story is simple and the romantic and family subplots are cute, but not deep or extremely engaging), but if you come into this movie expecting the right thing, you will get your money's worth.9/10","Jul 5, 2007",10,/10
"The Transformers is good visually, but when it comes to the story, it seems a little iffy. At times, I just can't follow along with the story. At times it seems like it's hard to know what's happening or what's supposed to happen. I feel like there is somewhat of a story but not entirely. The story seems more midtier and the movie seems better when it comes to visuals. They did a good job at portraying the transformers in live action. With the Transformers being able to transform between a vehicle and a humanoid creature, it seems it would be weird if it's adapted into live action. I find they did a good job at adapting into live action without looking too weird.Back to the plot related details, I feel it does a not so good job at developing characters. It doesn't seem to really develop the characters much. At times it seems characters are there to just be there.Overall, I find it alright visually and needs to be developed more in the story department.","Jan 23, 2024",7,/10

"This movies great for entertainment with a semi likable plot. Transformers does a surprisingly good job at captivating you with all of its fascinating visual effects, cgi, and incredible action sequences. The concept of having colossal robots disguise themselves as different vehicles and transform at any given moment is an ambitious one without a doubt. However, I think this film does a great job of not overwhelming you too much with this by focusing on the protagonist sam. The narrative would often be shifted to become more about his journey with the Autobots as the overarching theme. Making the film about Sam helps ease you into the Autobots motives gradually whilst also providing bits of levity. Something else I found amusing was seeing that the Autobots had a conscience and were capable of rational thought. Seeing stuff like that made for a more dynamic experience since I got to see how they interact with each other in a non automated way. If I were to pick out a few negatives I would say I wish the film had more extensive Autobot fights. There also was a few loose ends that could've been wrapped up in the movies conclusion. Otherwise this is a solid film that's worthy of watch.","Jun 25, 2024",7,/10
"If your like action movies, you are in for a treat. To any fan who grew up following the exploits of the changeable machines called ""The Transformers"" this offering will become the Holy Grail of your interest. The movie has so many qualities which breath life into the original comic book heroes, it is difficult to point out which parts are the best. From first to last, the track is packed with breath taking action scenes and fabulous and heroic characters. Suffice to say both the visual confrontations, which fills the screen with an on going intergalactic conflict and the exemplary story which brings the several groups together to fight the invading metallic giants. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is the small town hero who along with his girlfriend Mikaela Banes, befriend the Leader. The success for the believability of this incredible movie, owes much to Jon Voight, who plays as Defense Secretary John Keller. In addition, John Turturro as Agent Simmons, Josh Duhamel who plays Captain Lennox and Tyrese Gibson who is Sergeant Epps insure top notch acting.

I didn't buy the Glasses idea, i think they could have come up with something way better as the same device. most of the dialog of the robots i found to be really uncreative especially the cheesy lines of megatron and optimus prime towards the end could have been better. The plot seemed to focus a lot on the human characters with not enough focus on the transformers themselves and their backstory.the ending was good though as well as the CGI and it was funny at times, i just wish there had been more action and less drama. all in all its a reasonably good movie but don't expect to see a great movie you would want to watch more then once.","Aug 1, 2007",6,/10

"Forget Roswell and little green men-here, aliens turn into Camaros and Peterbilt trucks. Michael Bay crashes onto the scene with Transformers, and it's an all-out sensory assault, like Fast & Furious fused with Star Wars. Autobots and Decepticons battle it out on Earth in a galactic brawl, and honestly, watching Optimus Prime take down a Decepticon is better than any Fourth of July fireworks display.Shia LaBeouf is the everyman teen caught in the chaos, somehow managing to date Megan Fox while screaming his way through robot battles. He's relatable, funny, and surprisingly endearing for someone just trying to cruise around in his beat-up car. Meanwhile, Megan Fox-let's be real-is there to remind us that Michael Bay has his priorities straight: explosions, mechanics, and, yes, aesthetics.Michael Bay is like a 12-year-old with an unlimited budget. Explosions? Check. Car chases? Check. An opening sequence that pins you to your seat? Double check. The guy knows how to deliver high-octane spectacle, and while he sometimes overdoes it, you can't deny his knack for pacing and bombast. It's big, loud, and unapologetically thrilling.The robot battles are the crown jewel. These aren't just machines throwing punches-they're leveling skyscrapers and turning city streets into war zones. Bumblebee's fights are more intense than any boxing match, and Optimus Prime? The dude oozes charisma, with speeches that could inspire a legion.Let's not kid ourselves-the plot is as thin as a sticky note: good guys, bad guys, a relic to protect, and an explosive finale. But does it matter? Not at all. You're here for the spectacle, and Transformers delivers in spades.Transformers is the cinematic equivalent of high-octane fuel and forged steel. Michael Bay knows how to overload your senses, and while the clichés are plentiful, you can't help but enjoy the ride. It's loud, it's brash, and it's ridiculously fun-a film that barrels ahead like a semi-truck at full throttle.","Dec 25, 2024",7,/10
"Who'da thunk? Michael Bay has created a film that bores, insults your intelligence, hurts your eardrums and gives you a headache... and all it asks for in return is three hours of your time! I'd be less angry if it was a simple Point A to Point B action movie, because it obviously never tries to be anything more than mindless high budget crap for the lowest common denominator. But it's not a simple Point A to Point B action movie, rather a schizophrenic mess whose main plot is only revealed after two hours of hilarious I'm-an-awkward-teen comedy and introductions of 1-dimensional side characters with annoying accents.You gotta respect that Bay fellow. He's managed to build a lucrative, long-lasting career in the movie biz despite having no directing talent whatsoever. People say his films are just for fun, yet I've never seen a movie of his which didn't give me epileptic seizures, make my blood boil and bore me with a 2 hour plus running time. I simply can't enjoy this man's creations no matter how I approach them.Don't let the title fool you; this has nothing to do with cool robots. In fact this film has nothing to do with anything. It's just another meaningless collection of stylized shots of sunsets, gunfire and tumbling cars set to swelling patriotic music for Bay to masturbate over. I feel bad for John Turturro, who's probably still trying to cleanse his body from the filth of this script.""Transformers"" is not intended for intelligent life from any planet. Don't see this, because there's nothing more here than meets the eye. Horrible.2/10","Jan 14, 2008",2,/10
"I have great news: even Michael Bay couldn't run a movie about giant robots fighting each other. Though he did give it his best effort in Transformers 2. Transformers is a fun blend of action and humor. The action never fails to impress. Some of the most beloved Transformers were lovingly created on-screen for this movie, and it's just fun to see them changing forms and actually doing the cool stuff that countless boys all over the world once had them doing in their imaginations. The explosions, special effects, and computer-generated robots are all a joy to behold. The humor only occasionally strays into territory that's too childish for even the kids that are a large part of the targeted audience. Most of the time, there are genuine laughs to be had to break up the long action set pieces. Shia Lebouf is a funny and likable protagonist, and pairing him with Megan Fox resulted in a pair of reasonably good central characters. This movie isn't really about the human characters, anyway. It's about the robots. And if you're a fan of Transformers, action, CGI wizardry, or all three, you're probably going to be as pleased with this as I was.","Jun 15, 2010",8,/10

"I'm big fan of the transformers(animation from 1986) but after watching this film I didn't know if I should cry or laugh. This pseudo movie is a typical American production, the less sense you get it is better for you. Story is very flat and I've a feeling that the authors are trying to imply the ""american way of life"". If you are looking for a cheap senseless entertainment or you have too much time, the movie is for you. You will get very big amount of special effects with very poor acting and bad movie sound. But the worst were the ""hacking parts"", they were just pathetic. I'm very disappointed and I won't recommend that movie to anyone.","Aug 28, 2007",1,/10

"I am a big Transformers fan and have been itching to see this movie for some time. I'm giving this a 7 because, like most fans, have expected the greatest movie ever and I guess it didn't completely get there. It was a very decent movie however I was just hoping it would have included more of a serious angle. A lot of the humorous scenes could have been removed as I didn't want it to turn into a fun teen flick. More character building for Megatron and StarScream would have also been ideal but I realized the movie would have been way too long if they added to much extra. Anyway, again, I think it was a decent movie but hope the next one has more plotting and scheming by the decepticons. Effects were quite cool.","Jul 4, 2007",7,/10
"Transformers is a awesome film. People who say its rubbish are ignorant and petty. The graphics are mind blowing. They have changed a few things but it doesn't matter because there is no point in always sticking to the old school cartoon. Also in the film they have given us humans a bigger part to play in the war between the transformers, this worked well because it first i believed it would be boring but we humans kicked ass!! Credit has to go to Steven Spielberg and Micheal Bay for making this film, the attention to detail is extraordinary Optimus Prime looks unbelievable. Though i would admit bumblebee is my favourite autobot hes so funny. 10/10 a must see!!!!!!","Jul 23, 2007",10,/10
"Wow! First off the special effects are f--king awesome! No contest, 'Transformers' has the best visual effects of the year thus far. But as a movie...it's all right. I mean it's entertaining as hell, but the acting/writing are kind of lacking. Shia LeBeouf is fantastic as always. Veterans Jon Voight, John Turturro and the always amusing Anthony Andersen are good, but the rust of the cast is disappointing. Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel give commercial-calibre performances and the lead female besides having a knock-out physical appearance is jaw-dropping awful. The writing is seriously lacking as well. They should take more time to explain what the hell these machines are and what they want, besides rushing the plot so much. All in all, 'Transformers' is your typical Michael Bay movie -- BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! CHEESY PLOT! LACKLUSTER ACTING! BAM! BAM! BAM! But hey, if you want to see some awesome special effects, 'Transformers' is without a doubt the movie for you. Grade: B-","Nov 23, 2007",6,/10
"I loved G1 when it was on the air, and had all the toys. I was afraid that Michael Bay would screw this up, but (aside from a shaky camera) it was incredible. Granted I spent more time focusing on Optimus Prime and the other Autobots and Decepticons than the humans, but that's the whole point of the movie, right? It's Transformers, not fleshy bags of mostly water.The theater cheered when Prime appeared, and for the other Autobots as well. Megatron was menacing. Barricade was an awesome character, and played well off of Bumblebee. It's not Schindler's List, but it was never meant to be. Go to this movie with the intent of enjoying yourself, and you won't be disappointed!","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10
"The plot of the film begins when Earth becomes battlefield in a war between Autbots and Decepticons – two races of alien robots capable to ""transform"", or, to mimic any part of ordinary machinery. While evil Decepticons want to conquer Earth and destroy humanity, Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voice by Peter Cullen) want to prevent them. In doing so, Autbots receive help from Sam Whitwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf), high school student whose ancestor accidentally found Megatron (voice by Hugo Weaving), leader of Decepticons, buried in Arctic ice. Young man is protected by Bumblebee, Autobot masked into car with whom Sam tried to impress his classroom crush Mikaela Barnes (played by Megan Fox).Reason why TRANSFORMERS is better than average Michael Bay's film is simple. Film based on a toy line is not supposed to burden scriptwriters with important and serious issues like penal system, human cloning, American pacifism or crime and punishment. TRANSFORMERS therefore couldn't be taken seriously, so Bay didn't need to try and predictably fail in such endeavour. Instead of that this film is taken as nothing other than an excellent opportunity to display the current state of CGI technology in Hollywood together with other, crude but effective ways to bring undemanding moviegoers to theatres during summer season.","Jan 29, 2011",7,/10

"Transformers was definitely one of the big summer blockbusters of 2007, but I never bothered seeing it in the movie theater because I never watched the cartoon when I was a kid. I was a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles girl; so basically since I never watched Transformers or played with the toys I figured I would never understand the movie, so why bother? But my friend and her boyfriend saw it opening night, and she's the same as me where she never watched the cartoon, but she said that this was a great film. So I figured I would just wait until the rental just so I can say I wasn't part of the hype that was this summer of the Transformers. So I watched Transformers last night and I have to say that I am amazed, I really did like the movie. It was filled with exciting action sequences, cool dialog, and amazing effects. The story also worked very well and the actors seemed to enjoy doing the movie.Sam is a teenage boy who is just looking forward to getting his very first car, his dad helps him get a used car that looks pretty busted up and not very special. But that proves to be a wrong theory, one night Sam thinks his car is being stolen when it is driving off. He chases after it and finds out that the car is an alien robot from outer space. He then finds more of these ""Autobots"" who are at war with the ""Decepticons"" and are after a box that will give them unlimited power and could possibly destroy Earth. So the Autobots are there to help Sam and his friends to save the world before the Decepticons can destroy it.Transformers is a great action movie, it occasionally has it's little flaws here and there, I mean when you really think about it, this is just one of those kick butt action movies. But it is a very well done film and I was really impressed on how great job the crew put this movie together. To be honest I now wish that I saw this in the theater because it must have been more exciting to see on the big screen. I would recommend it though, but watch it on a large screen television if you get the chance, I think you'll get the better effect, because that's the only way to watch an action movie.8/10","Oct 21, 2007",8,/10

"I was a fan of the cartoons. I'm a lover of action movies. This movie is simply awful; and I like Michael Bay's 'The Island' The good; CGI is clearly reaching incredible complexity, the transformations are simply mind bending. However, they are few and far between, and simply do not make for a 'good movie'. Any movie can have 5 minutes of transformations, but you still need to fill the other 2 hours with content.The bad; everything else. The action scenes are way too close, too fast, too blurry, too loud, without any rhyme or reason. Whenever you think you are about to see something cool, it cuts away to the irrelevant human story that feels tacked on.The autobots are mere shadows of their former selves. The once intelligent ironhide is reduced to a trigger-happy moron. Optimus Prime is a single-minded brute who often makes clumsy mistakes. Jazz is just a rap-artist break dancer in disguise. This is just awful, awful stuff.The human 'story' is not a story at all. It cuts between a few different stories, and we don't care about any of them. Are human stories bad? No, not at all, in fact that is what this movie needed; a good human story. However, Sam the adolescent moron is hardly captivating, the untouchable soldier is simply not compelling, and the government hackers remind me of all those awful matrix/swordfish hackers that are just a joke.Here's how this movie should have 'rolled'. We should be introduced to cybertron, and the beginnings of the war. Start with a big battle scene. We make our way to earth. War continues. Human casualties cause a single person/group to hate the transformers and wage war on them. The autobots, under attack by the humans, convince the humans they are good by saving the humans from the decepticons. Autobots and humans team up to beat decepticons. Big final battle with all the decepticons vs. all the autobots. The end. Now, if you've seen the movie, a lot of those points may seem like what happened in the movie; but if you remember all the added garbage, like the awkward parents scene, the autobots hiding in the suburbs, the stupid government base nonsense and hacker garbage...you know my version would be a far better paced movie.Don't waste your time. thewaythetruth.com","Jul 13, 2007",1,/10
"As a kid i used to watch transformers every day and i was a big fan of them. So i was really looking forward to it. But i was afraid the movie was going to be a failure, like it happened (in my opinion) to previous adaptations from cartoons and video games to the big screen like superman, street fighter, the hulk and spider man among others. Thank God it wasn't anything like that. It was totally awesome, the robots looked great but i have to admit that bad guys looked cooler, plot was well adjusted and visual effects amazed me the whole movie. All people involved in this film did a great job and i know true fans out there loved it too. All i can say to sum up this comment is that it is maybe the best movie of his kind so far.","Jul 28, 2007",10,/10
"The CGI/Specialeffects team did an outstanding job in this movie, no question about it. The Transformers look incredibly good, movements and fighting scenes are a joy to watch. Also every Transformer has his own personality which was well done.
The story and cast was okay. Feels a bit Hollywood polished maybe. I think 'Transformers' is watchable. Not a 1* movie, not a 10* movie and I enjoyed it too much to give it less than 7*.","Jan 10, 2019",7,/10
"I have been a fan of transformers my whole life....growing up in the generation when they were on TV in the mornings, collecting the toys and swapping them with friends, this movie had a lot to prove to me.I went in today to watch it and was blown away by the movie. It was visually amazing and had a good selection of characters in the film, my only small issue was that devestator wasn't a combination of the constructacons, though the script may have been the way as he may have out shadowed the evil megatron.The script was done pretty well, with some good human character that will draw you into the the story, the music was done very well and integrated with the sound effects well.Overall i gave this movie a 10, though i may be biased because I'm am such a big fan, after seeing it, i wanted to see it again.I cannot wait to see (if there is one) a special edition version of the movie with any bonus footage.Go see it now Autobots...roll out!!!","Jun 27, 2007",8,/10
"I watched Transformers was I was in my early 20's and loved them. When the teasers started appearing, I made plans to see the film when it opened. I was in the second row of a packed theater for the first showing on the 4th of July. Yeah baby! The movie itself didn't disappoint. It was Godzilla 2000 meets Independence Day- plenty of action, sarcasm, and unbelievable environments. You ever seen a two ton robot deliver a one-liner? You will here. What impressed me most is how true the writers were to the Decepticons and Autobots. Except for a few new curveballs thrown into to keep the plot credible(?), all my favorite characters were there.Optimus Prime rocks!","Jul 7, 2007",6,/10
"Seeing the trailer I thought it looked amazing, but being a trailer some are deceiving to when you go watch the film. This film went so much further than my expectations, the film was constantly moving, very funny and most off all the affects were beyond the Matrix. The story line was brilliant and the cast were also fantastic picks (Megan Fox and Rachael Taylor) as the leading women they looked amazing. Go see in the cinema, I rated this film a Top 10 but some other people have rated this film lower, which I think they must have watched it on their crap pirate copy where you would lose all the special affects.Amongst all the other top films to see this year, this would be the best film and I know it's tough and a bold statement even from me being a huge fan of the Simpsons I think this film would be better, Sorry all fans.","Jul 25, 2007",10,/10
"While it's true that the franchise does get progressively worse with their sequel, but it all just started with one harmless film. Transformers is just an example turning a series into a your cheesy sci-fi film. On one hand, this is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously for an action movie with stale jokes, unnecessary special effects and weak human characters. But on the other hand, it movie can be fun with a decent story, some of the good action, and great designs on Autobots and Decepticons. Normally as a movie based on a series, I would say you must think of what you are watching as a live action movie based on Transformers. But I can mostly recommend this for the most die hard fans of the franchise. Those that are actually familiar of either the toys or the shows, those are the ones that will have a blast with this. Honestly, it would pretty much be better off of this is a stand alone film and the sequels never existed. I'm not saying rebooting it is a terrible idea. In fact, Transformers has done it with Bumblebee and that actually turned out to be a good movie. It's just one of those franchises where the more movies are made, they made it worse for the reputation of Transformers. I just want to state that with Michael Bay not directing Bumblebee and the upcoming one, Rise of the Beast, we might see the franchise get to the right path of making good movies. Yes this is directed by Michael Bay too, but I would consider the most tolerable of the franchise.","Aug 30, 2022",6,/10
"I will start this with an honest statement; I got more than I expected when I saw this movie, and I believe this is Michael Bay's best film to date.However; saying this does not mean this movie was any good.I'm not going to re-hash what was already said by others, but I will point out my two biggest gripes with this movie: 1. My Second Biggest Gripe: The dialogue in this movie was, at times, bloody hideous. Overacting, cheesy one-liners, and bountiful supplies of obvious statements abound as it seems Bay is trying to fill in gaps of time. Maybe we would rather a shorter movie than have our time wasted with useless characters with worse dialogue. Hey, remember the kid who played that nerd from Buffy? Remember when he had about three crappy lines, and then disappeared inexplicably from the movie forever? Yeah, me neither.2. My Biggest Gripe: The Transformers were not the subject of the movie. Instead, we focus on the human players and their worldly struggles with surviving in the Middle East, getting the girl, hacking the code, proving their worth, and generally just mucking around and taking the focus away from where it really belongs: the Transformers themselves. The Autobots weren't even introduced until half-way through the movie, and even then they are limited script-wise to either some long-winded tirade by Prime,or some down right awful one-liners which are sometimes even worse than the dialogue from the cartoon itself (coming from the age of Thunder Cats and Visionaries, I think most of you '80s 'toons fans know what I'm talking about).All and all, I enjoyed the movie, but only because the action sequences were pretty keen, in my opinion. I like a good destruction-fest, and don't even need a real movie around one for me to enjoy it (which is a good thing, because there wasn't much real movie in Transformers anyway).EDIT: After watching this crap-fest for a second and third time, I have lowered my score from 6 out of 10 to 4 out of 10. Why? The horrible, horrible plot holes. I mean, come on, David Lynch has made movies with more coherent plot than this garbage.","Jul 11, 2007",4,/10

"The biggest surprise was how good the storytelling was. The romance between Sam and Mikeala wasn't predictable or stereotypical. I (and audiences and general) felt like I was learning about these giant alien robots with the characters, and I'm a sucker for movies with aliens that I don't know much about.But to address the elephant (or giant robots) in the room (movie), the visual effects go up there with The Matrix and Independence Day. The level of detail blew my mind, and the size of the set pieces was some of the best at its time. Transformers is one of the most iconic sci-fi franchises around, and even if you're not a super fan, this is still a movie you should watch at least once.","Feb 3, 2024",7,/10
"Transformers was fine entertainment. Definitely skewed towards a young audience (tweens) thanks to its simplicity.Big 'wow' factor, especially with the speccy spfx. One jaw-dropping moment, in particular, was a scene late into the movie when a gold-coloured Decepticon (the evil robots) appeared to be roller-blading down the freeway in pursuit of the good guys.Really impressive how seamlessly the animation blended with the live action.The part that left a really nasty taste in my mouth was how blatantly pro-war it all was. Military might and efficiency plus zero body count (wait, did someone die in this movie?) as opposed to the grim and harsh reality of countless deaths daily in this current war and pretty well every other war that's ever happened. I even turned to my guy at one stage and said (obviously ironically) ""I wanna enlist!"" That definitely seemed to be what Bay was going for above all else.Ugh!","Jul 10, 2007",5,/10

"It is hands down the best summer popcorn flick this year.Basic premise, a cube of enormous power lands on earth, Megatron tried to get it in the 19th century and failed, now the Decepticons want it to use it against Earth (as a launching point to ruling the universe), while the Autobots want to keep it out of their hands, and destroy it if they have too.This movie is a cut above the others because it doesn't leave out the human factor. It would've been easy for director Michael Bay to simply focus on the robots and use the humans as cannon fodder, but humanity actually has a say on the Autobot/Decepticon showdown. Shia LeBeouf, who is the main character, excludes charm and sardonic wit as does minor character John Turturro (nice undershirt pal!) who plays a spoof of Will Smith's character from MIB.There were many problems with the movie. While Shia Lebeouf is in fine form (the comedians in this movie were the best - Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson), some characters were cardboard stereotypes (Megan Fox and Josh Duchamel and his men).Another issue was some of the fighting scenes. It was hard to make out who was who and the first fighting scene with Bumblebee and Rampart was virtually unwatchable (I mean, all this is CGI, why are the robots out of focus and off centre!?) Also, you can't really tell the difference between Ironhide and Rampage when they are robots.Another issue is the inclusion of a ""Michael Bay"" eye-rolling moment. Whether it is the sappy exchange in Pearl Harbour (okay half the movie is sappy) or the animal cracker scene in Armaggeddon, why is there tender moment in the middle of a fight? However, these issues are minor complaints to a movie that doesn't aspire to be what it is (and it actually has a shout out to Hasbro in the credits). It is an engaging, funny and spectacular spectacle.","Jul 4, 2007",7,/10
"What is this ""Transformers?"" If you grew up in 1980s, especially if you were a male, the answer would have been part of your daily knowledge. This reviewer grew up in the 1990s, so even though the ""Transformers"" phenomenon was not as powerful as it was in the 1980s, this reviewer still remembers watching the many reruns on ""Cartoon Network."" Nonetheless, this reviewer remembers watching the reruns of the television show, along with many other ones from that era. The question will be asked: will fans of the television show like the movie? Will it appeal to the non-fans as well? The answer to those questions is an absolute yes.Sam Witwicky buys his first car, but, to his surprise, that car was actually Bumblebee, a member of the Autobots, disguised as a Camaro. Through Bumblebee, Sam discovers the secrets about the mysterious ""Allspark,"" a cube that gives machines the gift of life, and the war that is going on between Autobots and Decepticons. Unfortunately, Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have landed on earth. In Qatar, there was an attack on the US military base, but those attacks were not from any particular human terrorist but two Decepticons. In addition, two other Decepticons attacked Sam and his girlfriend, Mikaela. These Decepticons want the Allspark for their own needs greedy needs, while the Autobots want to destroy it because of its corruptive power. With more and more Decepticons appearing, Bumblebee sends a message for other Autobots to come to Earth. Now the war hits the Earth and it is up to Sam, with the help of the Autobots, to ensure humanities survival.The special effects, created by Industrial Lights and Magic (ILM), and fight scenes were phenomenal. Every time one of them did their transformations, your jaw will literally hit the floor. Special effects have been amazing over the years, but you have not felt this overwhelmed since seeing the Dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park."" Never once did you feel that it was computer generated. It is consistently action packed, and never once during its 144 minutes does it feel boring. Sure there is at times, when the trademark ""shaky"" cam came into play, making it very difficult to tell what was going on, but there is also times where they would slow down the fights to show you the most important scenes.There are many references to the cartoon series. Some lines from the original cartoon series are quoted in this. The great Peter Cullen, who was the voice of Optimus in the animated series, voices Optimus Prime in this one too. They do make little tiny tweaks to the designs of the characters, for a more modern look, but it would have looked extremely cheesy if it was left unaltered. If you were a fan of the series, you are going to love the references.Besides the action, special effects, and many references to the cartoon series, the humor was surprisingly well done. It is surprising how much humor is actually there and even more surprising how much it works. There are some parts where the audiences, and this reviewer, are laughing so hard that you could not even hear what the characters are saying after words. Warning to parents: some of the most humorous scenes are very adult, so if you do not want to explain to your young children some awkward things, do not show them this movie.The acting is nothing special, but it does the job. The most impressive is Shia LeBeouf as Sam. This role really showed that he can do big budget lead roles, a big step up from his days as Lewis Stevens in ""Even Stevens."" Megan Fox is in this for nothing else but eye candy. Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel are in this film, but as expected, do not do anything for their roles but play Soldiers. Anthony Anderson and Bernie Mac bring great comedic relief. Peter Cullen shows off his iconic voice as Optimus Prime. John Voight is a great president too!In conclusion, go see ""Transformers"" because it is an awesome action movie. Fans of the series are going to love it and the casual fans are going to love it as well. As a fan of the show, this is everything expected, and much more. You should see it as soon as you can to get the full effect. The audience, this reviewer saw it with, loved it. There were many laughs at appropriate times, lots of cheering for great action scenes and the appearances of popular characters like Megatron or Optimus and a big applause at the end credits. It just made the film so much more enjoyable, and that is why you see a big budget ""Transformers"" movie. It is not ""The Godfather,"" nor should the audience pretend it was. ""Transformers"" is a movie to have fun viewing, and boy is it!","Jul 9, 2007",10,/10

"In 2007 Michael Bay delivered us the very first live action Transformers film. Seven years later we are about to see part four of his franchise. Within the next eleven days, before the release of Transformers: Age of Extinction, I am going to review the first three films that Michael Bay directed. So here we go with the very first film, Transformers.Re-watching this film after having not seen it for about three years, I found myself mostly uninterested in the film. Sure the action is amazing, great use of the CG by Michael Bay, but there really isn't anything great about the film. Certainly not perfect in any department as well. However if you look up the movie term, Summer Blockbuster, I'm sure you will find pictures of Michael Bay films, more so Transformers. The story is light and paper thin. No one set out a goal to win Oscars when they made this film. They wanted a high octane action film for summer movie fans, and frankly in that regard, they succeeded at a high level. The acting is mostly just awful. Shia LaBeouf is simply annoying, can't like his character at all. The only actors who are enjoyable and do a great job are Jon Voight and John Turturro. Anthony Anderson had me cracking up in the few scenes he had in the film as well. While we are on humor here, I must say, the humor factor is over the top. Not as over the top as the sequel though.Michael Bay, the director of this film, is known for those big epic summer blockbusters, he has been making them for many years now, and with no signs of slowing down. While he never really gave us great stories with complex characters, he does give us amazing action scenes, that we will remember for awhile. Since it was so long in between my last viewing of this film, I was kind of shocked looking back at how many big gaps fill in between the great action scenes. There is a lot of worthless banter back and fourth, and more stupid humor, that really drags this film down. The acting in this film as I mentioned above is overall just bad, minus a couple examples. Michel Bay isn't really known for getting great performances out of his stars, and this film continues that trend. He just likes to blow stuff up, and in the end, he does it very well.Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman wrote this film, as well as the sequel, and I won't put it lightly, these guys are a laughing stock of their profession. This might be one of the few times you don't want to punch the writers in the head. Watch the sequel to this film, and you will change your attitude. While this story is simple minded it is effective for the start of the franchise. While I do not like these writers at all, I must admit they didn't mangle this film here I am talking about. They weren't perfect either. The characters are very wooden and not really developed at all. I don't really take all of this out on them because of the type of film it is, but it wasn't a great overall effect.Overall the start of this franchise isn't going to be making any top ten lists of mine, unless of course I make a list of mindless summer blockbusters. The action in this film is amazing, and while there are a lot of boring parts in between, when it goes back to the action, you just keep loving it. Remember, as I said above, this is a pure popcorn summer blockbuster film. If you lay back and remember that key fact, I see no reason why you cannot enjoy this film for what it really is.7/10","Jun 15, 2014",7,/10
"Terrific film if you like two hour commercials for HP computers, Sony stereos, GMC trucks, Chevrolet performance vehicles, and Pontiac sports cars...

Bumblebee defends Sam and his girlfriend Mikaela Banes from the Decepticon Barricade, before the other Autobots arrive on Earth. They are searching for the Allspark, and the war on Earth heats up as the Decepticons attack a United States military base in Qatar. Sam and Mikaela are taken by the top-secret agency Sector 7 to help stop the Decepticons, but when they learn the agency also intends to destroy the Autobots, they formulate their own plan to save the world.I was quite surprised that many people were at the earliest showing today, July 4th. Hoping to watch the movie with a couple of people with teenagers and crying babies away, I was quite disappointed but it didn't ruin my movie experience.The film was decent. This is coming from a guy who knows nothing about Transformers. The oh-so-incredible action sequences weren't that good and the plot, well, you know, was paper thin. Sure the CGI was flawless but you expect more. I found the camera work better than Bay's past films and the score great (except Linkin' Park).This is all you know when you see this film: Good robots vs. bad robots trying to find this mystical cube. If you want to watch this film for its plot and story, you'll be disappointed. Do you even think this film needs a good plot? No. It's a fun filled action film.I thought the film excluding the last forty minutes was decent. I expected more from Bay but as the last forty minutes rolled in, it gets thrilling. The action is non-stop. I liked the humor throughout the film which makes it entertaining. Shia LaBeouf plays a charismatic character and Megan Fox a sexy, but smart, girl. Others like Josh Duhamel and Jon Voight was good.Do not watch this movie expecting a great story. Watch it to be entertained with the action sequences and humor. Michael Bay isn't a grand storyteller yet but he is a professional popcorn movie director.","Jul 4, 2007",7,/10
"I really didn't expect too much, I mean, watching the cartoon series today makes me cringe. But boy is 'Transformers' one bad movie.Action flicks seldom care about good stories, plots and screenplay. But most action flicks don't pretend to. This one, however, appears to have been four hours long, before they cut it to two and a half. It introduces about three dozen characters and just as many mini subplots, all of which are unnecessary, meaningless and stupid. Then they throw in so many bad clichés, I didn't know if it was a really bad satire or just reeeeeeaaaaalllly bad. The characters are two dimensional and the girls were obviously picked for looks alone.The only thing the movie could have going for it, would be the action. But no, not really, no. Visual and Special effects have reached the point of near perfection a couple of years ago, and between 'The Matrix' and 'The Lord of the Rings' there's not much left to impress by simply rendering it and showing off the with the coding work of a couple of nerds. The direction of the action is substandard. Most of it is simply having things blow up or chases. Nothing we haven't seen better in so many movies before.So with a sh*tty screenplay and boring action, the only thing that movie has going for it, is the acting of Shia what's his name. I really liked him, I think he's gonna be entertaining in lots of better movies yet to come.","Oct 2, 2007",3,/10

Transformers 2007 is easily the best film of the 5 films but Michael Bay as director I didn't like so much. All of the lore and history from the comics is not explained and most of the Decepticons get little to no screen time or backstory. If only Michael bay cared even half as much about the Transformers lore as his fans do. It could have been such a mature, interesting exploration of aliens deserted on a foreign planet, the last species of their kind, but terrifying in their power. Instead, it becomes, 'FAST CARS, HOT WOMEN, FAST CARS, EXPLOSIONS, LENS FLARE, SHIA LEBEOUF BEING FUNNY, EXPLOSIONS, LINKIN PARK'.","Sep 6, 2022",7,/10
"Okay, this is my first review on this site so I'm going to warn you. This is not perfect, there will be some mistakes seeing that I'm only 14 years old. That is all, no lets get to the review.I first heard about the movie a couple of months beforehand. But before then, I had only seen the original movie and enjoyed it. I wanted to see the movie and when I finally did sometime near the end of July/beginning of August. I had one of the best times of my life. My mom did too (We went on her birthday) and I only have one thing to say about it- WOW! Now let's get to the review shall we? PLOT: The plot is pretty good, but for the series, it's straightforward- Robots come to Earth, Some humans befriend the good ones, the good bots (The Autobots) fight against the villains (The Decepticons). That pretty much it, but there are some thing that are added in,. For example, Megatron came first and got frozen, The villains free him and they go all Godzilla like on the Autobots for the All-Spark, destroying most of a city in the process. score-8.5/10 (If it wasn't the same formula that it was in all of the other series, I'd have given it a 9.5) Casting: The cast was pretty good, It's a shame though that they used a new voice for Megatron (Hugo Weaving) instead of his old one. My other gripes are that no one understands what the heck Bonecrusher (Jimmie Wood) is even saying and couldn't they have gotten Keith David to do Barricade in the movie instead, that peed off many fans. The score for the cast- 9/10(I'd given this a perfect score if it wasn't for those problems) SFX: This is where the movie shines, ILM has outdone themselves again. providing the majority of the CGI in the movie, there were also some props in the movie portraying the robots (Provided by KNB Effects and ILM-they did the Skorponok props, the head and tail in other words). My only gripe is the fact that the girl doesn't get any water on her when Ironhide (Jess Harnell) comes out of the pool. My score is 10/10 for these effects, they pulled them off nicely.Overall: This move is a must see for TF fans as I myself enjoyed it (and I'm one too). But I have one question, why do so many people bash this movie anyways-9.9 out of a perfect 10.Phil MacRae- Self appointed fan of Soundwave (I'm adding fun signatures at the end of my reviews just to tell you).","Feb 22, 2008",9,/10
"this is the one of exciting movie for me. The scene where a huge robot fights is very cool. I like the movie which mechanical thing fights. I watch it repeatedly with my family. This movie is just the thing.This movie is incredibly funny and definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the film. The story is simple to understand and perfect for this type of movie. The hero in this work is ashamed at first but he changes himself. He fights for mankind with the enemy's robot. It is reckless Then he is very cool. In the scene where the robot which came to save the human is restricted by a human being, I think that human weakness to the thing which does not harm.The effects and the quality of CG is very good. It's very reality. Above all, I recommend this film. If you watch it you will be excited.","Jul 26, 2016",6,/10
"I thought this movie had some pacing problems and had a really hard time getting to the point, but once it was able to get to Optimus Prime and the other Autobots, it really picked up. We figured out the plot and we met the leader of the villains, Megatron and then we reached our climax where we had a huge CGI Autobot vs. Decepticon fight. Usually I find that in any big monster or robot blockbuster movie, they overplay the humans in the movie but i actually really enjoyed the human scenes i. This particular movie. All in all, this movie shouldn't work on any levels but the thing that brings it all together is the visual effects on the final fight. Absolutely stunning!","Mar 20, 2022",8,/10
"Let me start out by saying that in my opinion, there is a market for movies that while the Character Arcs may be lacking, the action is doubled down on. That's exactly what this movie is. This movie is the most Actioniest Action Movie you would ever see. There was a part of me that was impressed with the military warfare, as well as the Giant Robot Action, (mainly from Optimus & Bee). It felt like it was ripped straight out of a Call of Duty game, which kind of worked for me. Don't get me wrong, there were action set pieces that were incredibly messy, but there were moments I could highlight.Shia LeBouf, Megan Fox led the movie just fine. They played their respective characters just fine. They both have their moments, but in all honesty, they're not great.I will say Peter Cullen has always carried this franchise on his back playing Optimus. He's never skipped a beat. He will forever be Optimus. He's Amazing. And Hugo Weaving was great as Megatron! Very menacing and was able to match with Cullen's gravitas.This movie is flawed, but it is Iconic, and at times enjoyable. It's not for everyone, but if you crave fast paced Action this movie is for you.C.","Sep 9, 2024",7,/10
"As a kid growing up in the 80's I was of course a fan of the Transformers. I still own a bunch of cool action figures and I never thought I'd see it as a live action movie.The trailers were pretty good so I was excited and hyped, and as usual went to watch it on the opening night.Unfortunately the movie falls short. I knew of course it was meant to be a blockbuster and it should be straightforward enough to please anyone. However the plot is REALLY lacking in depth and the characters range from interesting to pathetic.Don't get me wrong there are a lot of good actors in this movie and they all go to waste playing mediocre rolls. The Defense Secretary is ridiculous, John Turturro's role as Agent Simmons is also completely idiotic. Shia LaBeouf is good and Megan Fox, although not a bad actress, has a stereotypical ""misunderstood babe who looks shallow"" role.The CGI is amazing of course but it just can't hold the weak plot. The transformers lack personality (except 2 or 3) and are in many ways unfaithful to the series.I wish they'd focus more on the plot and made a better movie. As a fan I'm sad to see this reduced to just another blockbuster with ridiculous characters, constant and exaggerated comic relief (IT DOESN'T STOP!), and a forgettable story.It really could've been so much more...","Jul 8, 2007",5,/10

"Through observation, it seems the modern summer moviegoer doesn't care about corny dialouge and mediocre acting, but only about being being thrilled and entertained and being blown away by extravagant special effects. In this case, Michael Bay has created the perfect summer movie. He doesn't let one moment get boring, and even though I have never been a transformers fan, I couldn't help but be thrilled when a blue and red truck transformed and uttered the words ""I am Optimus Prime."" The action sequences are breathtaking and the final half an hour does not disappoint. After god knows how many movies that were just plain bad, Michael has made fine, check-your-brain-at-the-door, entertainment for millions. Congradgulations.","Jul 16, 2007",7,/10
"I have to say that I watched this movie out of curiosity, people have been raving about it since it hit theaters and now that it is on DVD I decided to give it a go... No amount of spit and polish can hide the fact that Transformers is pure garbage. So let me start with the high points. The CGI is beautiful. I have experience with 3D modeling and animation and must say that my mind was blown by all of the beautiful transformation sequences and details in each robot. The team behind Transformers will surely get the Oscar for best special effects and deservingly so. The rest of the movie is mediocre at best... The foundation of any decent movie is its screenplay and this movie is a compilation of stupid character archetypes, clichés and failed attempts at humor that reinforce the summer movie money whoring feel. Slightly nerdy, doesn't quite fit in protagonist: CHECK. Sexy, slightly snobbish girl who needs to be won over by protagonist: CHECK. Life altering encounter with object that alters the ordinary world: CHECK. Source of conflict found in one all powerful artifact: CHECK. The dialogue is riddled with goofy lines that have come to be expected in crappy movies based on comic books and any theme is an afterthought since Michael Bay's only concern is filling every frame with things that go boom and special effects. Bay is what I fear most, an anti-artist out to make millions for movie studios every summer. His movies are empty and formulaic and aimed at the masses for maximum monetary return. He undoes the work of so many great filmmakers that has come before him by allowing audiences to escape into a ridiculous world where they are in no way thrust into cognition. Have Bergman, Fellini, Truffaut, Bunuel, De Sica and Kurosawa's work been for nothing? Literature, cinema, and music are artistic arenas and as such all entries into these forums should be judged on their artistic merit. Period. My biggest grievance is the fact that this film felt like a 143 minute commercial. Not since The Wizard have I seen a film that promotes a product so well. After watching I felt like I was being begged to buy a General Motors vehicle and joined the armed forces. It was disgusting. Performances are mediocre but it is really a moot point considering that the actors really didn't need to convey much, act surprised here, awkward there, courageous at the end... The usual. I beg anyone who has any respect for cinema to avoid this film and indulge in something of substance... To anyone who enjoyed this I implore you to take some time to try and enjoy something less commercial...","Oct 22, 2007",3,/10
"I am really ashamed I have not seen this movie in the theater, I thought of this movie first as of something with childish robots shaped in cool cars. Well I have to disagree with my first opinion of the movie. When I watched this movie, I was astonished of the good effects, the humor, the dialogs, the action - and above all the soundtracks, made by Steve Jablonsky. It all sounds a bit like Hans Zimmer, though Steve has some incredible Cello-tunes in his song, especially in the song called ""arrival to earth"". I would like all of you to listen well to the music in this movie, and if you get distracted by the movie itself, just buy the official soundtrack CD, you will not regret that!","Nov 24, 2008",8,/10

"The partnership between Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay to bring the intergalactic struggle between the noble Autobots and Decepticons to life, in metal and CGIs on the big screen, could only be epic.It also reveals Megan Fox, whom Michael Bay films with passion. The chemistry between Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox - both on and off screen - adds to the authenticity of their characters.This first installment in the Transformers franchise definitely has something worth watching and enjoying again.It is, in my opinion, the best episode after 'Bumblebee' (2018).","Mar 6, 2022",9,/10
"Transformers, whether you love it or hate, is a somewhat decent film but could've been a lot better had the direction and writing been a little more fleshed out and coherent. True there are some great action scenes but they all (once again) suffer from that tried and tested ""MTV style"" editing that makes it so hard to appreciate the action. I can name many sci-fi action films that have much better action scenes than Transformers but I'm not going to as I felt I should keep this review short and sweet as others have pointed out the many flaws in this film; some of which I will list here. Having just seen the second film a week ago, I'm just gonna say this one was much better than the second one, why? Well, I just feel that this one has a much better focus on the story,not that there's really is a story to begin with, but it just jived with me for some unknown reason. I don't know, but I just feel this one is much better. On that note, Transformers is not as bad as the second one but Revenge of the Fallen was the pits as far as I'm concerned. If you seen the first film and are eager to see the second, then go ahead but I rather see Transformers again (on DVD) then revisit ROTF. Not good or bad, just ""okay"".Final note: I hope they replace Michael Bay with the third film and get the writers from the ""Beast Wars"" series. MUCH better than Orci and Kurtzman 100%.","Jul 22, 2009",7,/10
"Transformers 2 does exactly what most fans go to see it for, it pits robot against robot on the big screen. It's an all-action explosion fest, directed by the king of over the top summer blockbusters, that turn out to be a funny, action packed flick. The CGI through out the film is top notch, one of best examples in the sci-fi genre in my opinion. the storyline, although has been largely set out for the writers due to the movie being based on a comic book series, is good quality and perfect for this type of summer blockbuster. uncomplicated, humorous and action-filled. Scenes between Meg Fox and Shia Le beuf are acted with affection and this clearly shows on screen, again, we haven't paid money to see a RomCom so the number of intimate scenes are adequate for the genre. The whole Transformers experience boils down to one thing, at the end of the day, visiting the cinema to see giant robots kick the C**p out of each other, and that they do in style. Michael Bay's portrayal of the epic battles that take place are well put together and give the audience what they are asking for. Overall this is a great movie, not there to grip the audience with a compelling storyline that deals with deep human emotion, one that shows of the wonders of CGI and gives us an epic war between giant robots. Michael Bay is a great director for the genre, and will no doubt keep making them in the future, and as much as everyone will slag him and transformers off, let's see how many of you are there to see the next one aye?","Jun 27, 2009",10,/10
"Transformers (2007) is a sci-fi action flick directed by Michael Bay, produced by Steven Spielberg and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It's based on the popular action toy line from Hasbro. It stars Shia Lebouf and Megan Fox in the leading human roles and also features Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving in supporting voice roles. It got mixed to positive response from critics but was otherwise a huge hit with audiences and a massive box office success. It spawned a movie franchise consisting of four sequels and a couple of spin-off prequels.The plot focuses on a war between two clans of sentient mechanical beings, the Autobots and the Decepticons, from the planet Cybertron. The war is centered on the Allspark, an ancient mysterious cube that has the power to bring inanimate technology to life but can also bring an end to it as well as humanity if fallen into the wrong hands. Young teenager Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebouf) gets caught in this conflict due to being in possession of an old pair of eyeglasses (which belonged do his great great grandfather) that have coordinates to the Allspark. This leads to Sam being hunted down and chased by the Decepticons as they want the Allspark to take over the universe. Sam meets and befriends the Autobots and together they come up with a plan to fight off the Decepticons and save the world.We have a set of different characters. I mentioned the protagonist, Sam Witwicky. There's Sam's love interest Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), who knows a lot about cars due to her dad being a mechanic (or as she puts it, a ""real grease monkey"") as well as a convicted car thief. She previously dated a jock bully whom she later dumped, and she and Sam develop a dynamic over the course of the film. Mikaela's car theft skills come in handy throughout the movie as she assists Sam on his mission.Sam's parents, Ron and Judy Witwicky are the human comic relief. Now we've got the Autobots. Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) is the leader of the Autobots and can transform into a semi-trailer (Optimus Prime resembles his original action figure counterpart pretty closely, albeit with a more updated look). There's also Bumblebee, who transforms into a Camaro and whom Sam encounters at the used car outlet, the former serving as a guardian to the latter. Bumblebee is unable to speak due to his voice chip being damaged in battle but can use his car radio as an alternate source of communication. He's basically the Iron Giant if the Iron Giant were mute and could turn into a car.We also have Jazz who can turn into a Pontiac, Ratchet who can turn into a Hummer, and Ironhide who's the weapons expert who can turn into a GMC pickup. Then we have the Decepticons who are the bad guys, led by our main antagonist Megatron (Hugo Weaving). Megatron had been frozen for over 70 years and was the one who hatched the plan to get a hold of the AllSpark to take over the universe. After those years, the AllSpark was rediscovered and since then, the other Decepticons, led by second-in-command Starscream, carried on this evil plan, until Megatron is eventually unleashed. That's about the gist of the whole thing.I saw this in theaters when I was 14 and I really enjoyed it. Rewatching it now, I still have a soft spot for this movie. It's a pretty decent sci-fi action flick with some cool action scenes, funny moments and an interesting lore. It basically plays out like Independence Day but with robots. The acting and directing are decent. It's not a perfect movie by any means as the storyline is rather formulaic and there's very little character development. But for what it is, it's quite good.I can't say the same about the sequels. I kind of liked Revenge of the Fallen, but it was a little overstuffed. I didn't like Dark of the Moon, Age of Extinction or The Last Knight. I really enjoyed Bumblebee and Rise of the Beasts though (Rise of the Beasts is probably my personal favorite of the Live-action CG Transformers movies). I may review those movies in greater detail, but I wanted to focus primarily on the first one. All in all, Transformers (2007) is pretty good, as far as big budget blockbusters featuring giant robots go.I give Transformers (2007) a solid 7.5/10.","Sep 20, 2024",7,/10
"The more of a Transformer fan you are, the less you will like this movie. I can see how non fans might like this movie, some of the effects are amazing but the autobots leave a lot to be desired. The autobots were pathetic. Some of the more noble of the autobots were reduced to little more than clowns and cannon fodder. I went hoping to see a movie about Transformers but what I got was a movie about people with a few robots thrown in. Words cannot express my dislike for Michael Bay. The movie is just another example of how Hollywood will usually screw up and water down anything that they get there grubby little hands on.","Jul 3, 2007",3,/10
"Transformers: a humble children's toy. Transformers: a cartoon show. Transformers: one of the greatest theater experiences I have ever had. When I heard that they were making a Transformers movie, I thought the same thing that I thought about a lot of other recent movies: What the heck are they doing wasting their time with this movie? Then I saw the trailer and I changed my mind. I knew I had to see this movie when I saw a jet plane fly under a bridge, transform, grab onto the bridge, and throw itself into the air. I went to see this with my friend who had already seen it two times.I truly was amazed. Though the story line was a little shaky and the shots were a little confusing, they were outweighed by the best special effects I had ever seen and the most edge-of-your seat action I had ever witnessed. In addition to Transformers becoming the coolest-looking movie I had ever seen, it was one of the funniest also, which was a big surprise.Sure there were some plot holes and sure this movie was completely unrealistic, but its lack of realism made it that much more believable. All I have to say is ""Bring on Transformers 2!""","Mar 22, 2008",8,/10
"Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay team up to bring the popular cartoon and toy series to a live action film. Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) is your typical teen: trying to get the money to get the car and the girl. His father agrees to help him out with the car and after grabbing a slightly beat up Camero, Sam's well on his way. After several weird incidents it becomes apparent there more to the car than meets the eye. It turns out that Sam has an intricate piece for a puzzle that brings a group of Autobots (robotic shape-shifting beings) to Earth. Lead by Optimus Prime, the Autobots must find the all-spark cube to restore life to their destroyed home of Cybertron. But the evil Decepticons led by Megatron want it for themselves and will destroy any city to get it.Pure popcorn fodder 'Transformers' could be nit-picked until the cash cows come home. This one has it all: silly script, annoying comedy relief, over blown CGI. You name it and it's here. But that's beside the point isn't it? What you want is robot-on-robot action tearing up the landscape. You do get a generous helping of it here with Bay's usual over-the-top MTV styling. The story does lag at times and only really works when the 'Tranformers' are on screen but again that's typical. The end result is a film that works perfectly for the little boy that lives inside many of us and that's about all you can hope for.","Nov 4, 2007",7,/10
"This critically acclaimed fantasy action film from director Michael Bay brings special graphics to a new level with visually stunning scenes involving transforming robots who have arrived on earth in order to settle a dispute. It's the Autobots and Decepticons who have crash-landed and are here to fight for what is theirs.Unfortunately as good and as impressive as the graphics are, the 2007 summer hit fails to capitalise on its effects with a thin plot and exceptionally poor dialogue. Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) gives an average performance as the geeky teenager who wants to impress the attractive Megan Fox, but both are soon wrapped up in the robot war.It's a film which dollops a heavy amount of information about another world on top of you with no depth and feeling to it. Jokes are predictable and the Autobots can be very childish and annoying at frequent points. The ending is ridiculous as its one of those lets all unite and fight and save the day scenarios.The film however gets to an interesting start with mystery and a new look on the Sci-Fi genre with the robots coming from another planet and all that but like so many other films these days, focuses too much upon the graphics and not enough depth to the plot to make it a poor and predictable fantasy action film.","Jan 8, 2008",4,/10
"First of all, I will say this movie was exciting and spectacular eye-candy. It was just too overly produced for my liking. Shia Labeouf truly shines and takes control of every scene he's in. The only actors i enjoyed were him and the relationship he had with his parents, truly good scenes. Why does Jon Voigt (or however you spell it) walk in every scene? WHY IN EVERY GOVOURNMENT SCENE DO THEY BLOCK IT LIKE AN E.R. EPISODE? I liked the effects and all, but the plot line and character reaction to the plot line gets so misconstrued a lot. This is not a movie for the acting, i realize, but please get Shia into like an independent drama and not an overproduce computer graphics love fest. All in all, good movie, i just wanna see Shia doing better things..","Dec 28, 2007",8,/10
"Standing in a crowded line waiting to watch Transformers yesterday, I had come prepared to see what Micheal Bay had transformed my childhood favorites into (pardon, the pun) Now as an adult I know that as a kid I also liked to eat candy that looked like worms. So looking back I know very well that the series looked much cooler then trying to digest them as adult now.Apart from that, I believe that that 8.0 user rating you see (on 17-07-07) will melt before your very eyes in the coming period and here's why; as you may know, Micheal Bay usually makes up for what he lacks in storyline with special effects and American patriot propaganda. In this case, the perfect choice if you want a cartoon to look like a real movie and if you want it to appeal for a war-tired/teen American audience. Unfortunately for Micheal Bay the rest of the world has yet to judge it too. I also think it is people who have been counting the days till the release of this movie who have been grading it so well. The rest of us did not bother to get in those long lines just yet. To be honest though, it does transcend the cartoon series...but just by the skin of it's teeth. Which is the best way of looking at it because looking at it in a different way, it will be a total suckfest. Script: Thin as a sheet. Ironically, it almost felt like I was back in the eighties when I watched this movie. Tiresome Americans (military) saving the world with guns blazing with big breasted women running around screaming and guys getting blown away all over the place...by robots. Direction: Sugar-rushed paced. It's a shame that Micheal Bay still does not understand that action is defined by the moments of quiet in between. In the action, things get very confusing during fights but you do get the notion of the sheer size, weight and power of the transformers. Special effects: Very good. The fact that computer graphics always have a plastic and synthetic like feel to them works very well in this case of course. The Transformers look perfectly real in the movie. Although, who has ever seen giant robots walking around?Acting: Mediocre. Unfortunately Micheal Bay tries to appeal to all audiences with the strange effect that you get very clownesque or very serious acting. I did get a great feeling of nostalgia to hear to Peter Cullen do the original voice of Optimus Prime but, as with all the actors, I cringed with the bad lines they put out there. Maybe James Cameron next time. He's got a thing with robots... 6 out of 10","Jul 18, 2007",6,/10

"All in all, Transformers is a really really good movie (stopping short of saying great). The action was really good and the CG was incredible. The reason I gave it a 7 was for two reasons. I really didn't like Sam Whitwicky in this movie. I felt like he was a spoiled little brat of a kid, whose ""witty"" dialog was quite frankly marginally written at best. Secondly, I felt like the writers tried a little too hard with the ""humor"" aspect. The whole ""finding the glasses"" scene took WAY too long, and was a little far fetched considering every step the Autobots make creates a loud boom sound. Sure it may not have been as ""funny"" but they should've stayed in their alternate mode to make it slightly more feasible that the parents (let alone the rest of the neighborhood) wouldn't have noticed giant robots outside their house.Again, though, a lot of fun, good action and a great movie that I can watch again and again. Hopefully next time I won't have to watch it with the stupid 5 year old twins sitting in front of me beating each other up and acting like stupid 5 year olds.

"This a film where the parts are not worth the sum of the whole. You don't see the Autobots until 1hr. into the film. It has a whole host of highly unnecessary sub plots, and the acting is atrocious on almost all counts (except for Michael O Neill who is quite believable, but seems to be in another film altogether). Shia Laboeuf comes off as a dumb version of Woody Allen's neurotic character, what with the stuttering and panicking. The character doesn't fit at all, although I'm sure he tried.There are plot holes and character deficiencies the size of meteors. The robots are outside the Witwicky residence 5 ft through open windows away from people. No one hears them talking. It turns from day to night in the beginning battle in about 20 seconds. The defence and phone network for the entire planet is knocked out, which would cause panic - yet nothing is mentioned. Where do the robots get their ammunition from? I am a kid who grew up with the Transformers in the 1980's, and from then until now have also been a way great movie fan. This film betrays the both of my childhood joys. I don't mind the fact that the robots were changed for the movie. Their designs are easily the best thing about the film. I don't even think Michael Bay is entirely to blame for this fiasco. Its the guys who wrote it. The subject has a fully formed mythology that could have easily benefited from a proper retelling - instead we are given a teen picture with no cohesive narrative, and no sympathetic characters...Nope - this is a screw up and no mistake. I would hold out hopes for Transformers 2, but I have my doubts unless someone pulls a Godfather style sequel to this dirge. Giving it 2 more stars than it desrves because its Transformers. And regardless of this they were the most inventive toy ever created.","Oct 9, 2007",4,/10
"My family and I rewatched this film last night with nothing else to do. The experience very much holds up 17 years after first watching it in theaters as a summer blockbuster. Transformers was always set up to just be a explosive time killer. But the cast is full of some great performances. Shia LeBeouf had some good credits before 2007, but time has shown him to be one of the most capable actors of his generation. I'm not trying to say anyone was robbed of an Oscar nomination in this film, but an outsized number of cast member's raise the caliber of their characters above the expectations of a movie called Transformers. What sticks out to me most 17 years later is how great of a time capsule this movie is for its time period, 2006-2007. I think this movie has been rightly made fun of or critiqued as one giant advertisement. From the film concept, to the product placement, to Michael Bay's well documented work with the department of defense, Transformers can be called a feature length commercial. That may have turned people off at the time, but I hazard to guess that nature of the film combined with its genuinely good aspects (some characters, some dialogue, CGI) will keep Transformers relevant for longer than anyone would have thought.","Dec 27, 2024",8,/10
"I'm a fan of the Transformers, but I'm not a massive fan like most people. So, I'm not going to be too upset if they don't do something right.The acting in the movie is ok and the actors are fine in it, I just think they spent too much time with the humans and less time with the Transformers.(They spent more time on the Transformers in the middle of the movie and the last 3rd)The Transformers looked cool and the effects for them were good. The action scenes with them are also cool seeing, but can be hard to tell what is happening.The voice acting of the Transformers were good and the Optimus Prime vs Megatron fight was really cool watching in the 3rd act. I can see people who are big fans of Transformers liking this fight.I thought the movie was fine.

"The premise would have been utterly ridiculed if it weren't for the fact that it already exists as a fixture in pop culture.Yes, the premise is silly, but what saves the film is the performances and humor, most notably from Shia LaBeouf.The special effects are also top notch, quite possible the best f the year.If you go in expecting little, you'll be satisfied. Deep drama this is not.Not a great fim, but at least a fun one. So turn down your IQ dial, and sit back and enjoy a good two hours crass Michael Bay sci-fi excess!","Sep 13, 2007",6,/10
"This movie was surprisingly good. I had no expectations whatsoever and left off watching it for months and months. And months. Finally came round to seeing it and it was actually very good. Perhaps not plotwise, but hey let's be fair, that's not what you're looking for in a film like Transformers. It was funny in the right moments, the special effects were spectacular, and Megan Fox is a fox. What bugged me was the introduction speech that Optimus gave of the Autobots, it really didn't sit well with the tone of the movie. But that's just a minor glitch and easily forgiven. Lots of good chase and action, not a dull moment and a nice set of actors with a quirky as ever John Turturro standing out in minor role. Watch and be pleasantly surprised.","Jun 23, 2008",8,/10
"As a die hard movie fan, I love watching all types of film genres. Iam a fan of transformers. I like michael bay movies since Bad Boys 2 and The Island. Well, I enjoyed watching Transformers movie, its action packed, comedy and dramatic too. Special Effects are awesome. Iam sure this film will get nomination for best special effects at the Oscars. Actors acted well. The storyline is satisfactory, not that great. I liked the emotional attachment between autobots and humans. Camera-work is good, Lighting is excellent. The action scenes is awesome, no doubts about that.But there are certain flaws in this movie. 1. There is one geographical error in this movie : Qatar Scene Mountains were shown in the background but there are no mountains in Qatar.2. Some of the decepticon robots don't have their own decepticon logo.3. Megatron is given predator look, I don't understand why michael bay is not sticking to original megatron shown in transformers movie 1986 animated version. Overall Barricade(Police Car) looks more better. I guess in this whole movie, the close shot of Starscream(F-22 Raptor fighter jet) is not shown.4. Last 30 minutes of film, Autobots and decepticons were fighting, there were few scenes, I could not understand who is fighting who.5. In this Film, there are few continuity errors in 1 or 2 shots.Iam not Michael Bay fan. Iam a fan of Steven Spielberg. At the bottom of my heart, I feel Steven Spielberg should be a film director and Michael Bay, an action director in upcoming transformers sequel. Michael Bay needs more improvement in direction platform. I watched this movie because Steven Spielberg is an executive producer. As a film critic, I will rate this movie 7.2/10 just because of flaws. As a normal audience, Its 9/10. Overall, Transformers is very good movie but could have been more better without these flaws. Its worth watching again when it comes in a DVD.","Aug 18, 2007",7,/10

"I don't hate Michael Bay, or Spielberg, or any of the money hungry ignorant contributers to this film. I do however resent being made physically ill. The acting, the script, and especially the music... it all made me feel violated in some way. Imagine throwing up blood in the shower, that's where this film takes you, it's a special place.It's poor at best. I went to the cinema expecting the worst, in hope that i wouldn't hate it as much after I'd seen it. The truth is, it's really, really, really, really, bad. An insult to anything cool, cultural, imaginative and honest. I am extremely disappointed that the original concept, story and characters were butchered with total disregard, but putting that aside (and i really tried), it is a genuinely bad film.Don't watch it. The people giving this film a positive review must like really shiny things, poorly timed and arranged music that doesn't fit the images, and thin plots riddled with faults. Action films are fine, this is a cringing attempt at a Disney-esquire, teen romance, sci-fi flick that fails everywhere. The 5 year old in front of me seemed to enjoy it, but maybe he likes shiny things too.By the way, Optimus Prime is the hero, not some kid called Sam.","Jun 27, 2007",1,/10
"Transformers is an absolute spectacle and one of my favorite movies of all time! Directed by Michael Bay, this film not only revolutionized the action genre with its groundbreaking visual effects but also brought to life the beloved characters from the iconic toy line and animated series in a way that feels both thrilling and heartfelt.Shia LaBeouf delivers an outstanding performance as Sam Witwicky, the relatable everyman who finds himself in the midst of an intergalactic war between Autobots and Decepticons. His character's journey from a typical teenager to a key player in an epic battle is both engaging and entertaining. Equally impressive is Megan Fox as Mikaela Banes; her charisma and strong presence elevate the film, adding depth to her character while also showcasing her skills in a high-stakes environment.The action sequences are jaw-dropping, with the transformation scenes and massive battles between the giant robots leaving viewers on the edge of their seats. The special effects are groundbreaking for their time, and they create an immersive experience that makes you feel like you're right in the middle of the action.Beyond the explosive visuals, the film has moments of genuine emotion and humor that make it relatable. The friendship between Sam and the Autobots, particularly Bumblebee, adds a layer of warmth that balances the intense action.Overall, Transformers is a masterful blend of thrilling action, great performances, and a captivating story. For its spectacular visual effects, engaging characters, and heartfelt moments, I give it a perfect 10 out of 10! This film is a must-see for fans of action and science fiction alike.","Oct 13, 2024",10,/10

"So, i saw Transformers last night. I went in armed only with fond, if vague memories of the cartoon when I was 5, but left sorely disappointed. The single thought I had most throughout the film was, what was the point in that? And I don't mean in the sense of over-the-top fights or visuals or anything, i mean in the sense of scenes and dialogue which either serves no purpose or leaves you cringing in your seat. For example - a hacker who is supposedly better than the Pentagon and NSA combined decides to 'hotwire' a computer. Or, witness the clumsiest attempt at political satire I have ever witnessed - the President with his feet on the desk in red socks asking for a ding-dong, or the shady official betting his 'ridiculously-oversized government salary' on it. There were some plus points about this film. The acting, in particular Shia LeBouef (sp?), was pretty good, while the VFX were simply stunning, easily the best I've seen. The combat sequences were also pretty good overall. But Michael Bay is simply the most inept filmmaker in the world; nay, in history. OK, maybe Im being a little strong but the whole film from start to finish just felt disjointed, as if he didn't really know what he was doing. He has succeeded in wasting a decent script, a good cast, and some breathtaking effects - it beggars belief that Steven Spielberg didn't either rectify things, or pull out. A waste of potential, and a big disappointment.","Aug 5, 2007",4,/10

"Damn you Michael Bay and Damn your Transformers Movie!!!! I finally saw the film today. The whole thing, front to back, all the way through and on the big screen. I sat down prior to the film with my big Icee and Whoppers prepared to hate every gut wrenching second of it. (it should be noted here that I bought tickets to the film Live Free or Die Hard which was a totally awesome movie I saw already and then walked into Transformers) There is no way it could be good. It's Michael Bay. He only makes crappy mainstream formula movies.*sigh* Transformers is actually a good movie. I liked it. Not only did I like it, I really liked it. I'm the kind of person who admits when he's wrong and I was wrong in this instance. Michael Bay's style was actually perfect for this movie. It definitely brought out the big kid in me. If you were a fan of Transformers you just can't help but get all excited and get into the movie. Optimus Prime, Jazz, Ironhide, Bumblebee, Rachet, Starscream, Megatron, they're all here and it was fun to watch. Just plain fun.Now don't get me wrong, there was some stupid stuff in the movie. Some scenes were meant to be nothing but funny and they were trying too hard. And some things just don't make any sense. But Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox are the keys to the whole movie. They win you over, they make you care, and they carry the movie through some of the absurd parts.Is Michael Bay a good director? I still say no. I hate his work actually. One good movie out of the dozens of others he's made doesn't make you a good director. But Transformers was a good movie and I really liked it. I can't believe I'm saying it, but it's true. In the hands of a better director this movie would have been great, but instead it's good. And it did win me over in the end. I didn't buy the ticket to the movie because I couldn't in good conscious let the film have my money, but in the end, I would have bought my ticket.","Aug 1, 2007",7,/10

"I'm a Transformers fan from way back. That immediately puts me in an awkward position for judging the new film - no matter what, I'm going to hold it up against the almost mythic standard of the old series as seen through the eyes of an adoring child. But considering that the film was obviously meant to cash in on that glassy-eyed nostalgia, I think it's a fair trade.So here we go. The Transformers did not, as feared, look hideously deranged or disfigured. They weren't quite the boxy and familiar-faced robots of memory, but they were mostly recognizable. Colours were toned down, which is good in that some Transformers had some truly hideous combinations, but also bad in that it meant I often had to hazard vague guesses as to who was doing what. The Decepticons were very non-entity villains, which was disappointing, and I often found myself confusedly scratching my head and wondering where Starscream's wealth of personality was.The biggest strike against the film was probably the amount of time spent with the 'fleshlings'. It wasn't even done very coherently. Scenes would change with all the fluidity of an unexpected bus stop, or else drag on to the point where I found myself wishing an Autobot would accidentally trip and squish them all. I felt like I was being ripped off during those scenes - after all, I didn't fork out my cash to watch an awkward teenage romance, a stirring tale about the bond between American soldiers, or some dull government drama. I paid to see the giant robots! And not only see them (or the occasional glimpse of them between the indecipherable transformation scenes and the large explosions) but to hear them, too. One of the appeals of Transformers in my opinion was that it didn't star the humans. This movie has it pretty much reversed.Still, that's not to say that the movie was all bad. A lot of it was helped along by having Optimus' original voice actor, and some things, like Bumblebee's personality, were quite accurate. The special effects and explosions were cool, but they mostly are these days, so that doesn't really count for much with me anymore. When I heard how much time they spent on getting the complicated new designs for the Autobots and Decepticons to transform, I found myself wondering why they didn't just go with something simpler that would have allowed for more screen-time with them. It's not like their efforts yielded the result of more spectacular transformations. The sequences were almost impossible to decipher, and frankly the new designs had an exposed look to them that made me think they'd all run out half-dressed.There are a few factors that stand in the movie's favor. Seeing the Autobots in live-action was very cool, and the Decepticons were appropriately frightening in their aggressiveness and disregard for human life. I found myself drinking in the scenes that actually did contain Transformers, and while most of the jokes were cheesy, there were a few funny moments that had me genuinely amused. The film managed to evoke my worry for the well-being of its non-human stars, and there was nothing particularly offensive to old-time fans. I give it a 5/10, half points for having cool Transformers but very annoying humans.","Jul 8, 2007",1,/10

"I suppose in order to review the live action film of the 1980s cartoon/toys 'Transformers' (2007) I have to confess that I spent much of the eighties playing with the robots and generally gobbling up everything with an Autobot logo on it. If someone had released this film back then I would probably give it the highest rating possible. Sadly, I'm way too old, jaded and wrapped in the nostalgia of the Saturday morning cartoon I knew and loved.If you don't know anything about the series (and I can't believe anyone could NOT know who Optimus Prime and Megatron are, but that's just me!), it - loosely - follows various narratives made popular in cartoon, comic and then computer-generated TV series and then blends them all together. But that's okay. They get the basics right - a group of good robots (who can change their appearance into Earth-based vehicles) arrive on our planet, but are quickly drawn back into their endless war with their evil counterparts, the Decepticons.I never saw this film in the cinema and I'm glad. This is down to my unique way of watching my DVD copy. I will explain. The film is well over two hours long and, for the first hour, you basically don't actually see one of the titular robots. Instead, we're treated to a teen-love story which utilises every cliche in the genre. A nerd (Shia LaBeouf) falls for the hot chick (Megan Fox) and has to impress her despite the best efforts of the jock (who I don't know the name of). In short... I don't give a damn about any of these characters. Controversially, I watch a film called 'Transformers' to see Transformers. Therefore, viewing this film on DVD allows me to skip every scene which centres on the annoying and pointless flesh-bags.Now, you may be expecting me to start saying how by ignoring the humans and concentrating on the robots make the film better. And it does. Sort of. Again, I'm trying to watch the film through the eyes of kids today and I can see them loving the robots in the exact same way as I did with those in the cartoons. For me, who's love of the franchise comes from the eighties (we call this 'G1' i.e. 'Generation 1') I wanted to see the robots look how I remember them. The Autobot leader 'Optimus Prime' is awesome. Fortunately the producers listened to fans and employed voice actor Peter Cullen to give him his personality - and it's by far the best part of the film. Even I could tell who Optimus Prime was because he basically looked how I remembered him. Sadly, the others didn't. A couple of Decepticons were okay (Starscream), but even Megatron was completely underused (he's the film's antagonist and yet only came into the story in the final act).If I was given a free reign to make a Transformers movie, yes I'd base it on the eighties look, feel and story. Sadly, Michael Bay had other ideas and the robots are hard to tell apart (Optimus Prime and Bunblebee excluded) when they're standing still. When they fight, whatever epic battle scene that should be before us is akin to smashing two grey jagged lumps of metal together repeatedly while Megan Fox poses provocatively.Basically, kids who have no prior knowledge of the franchise will probably love this. For 'oldies' like me, I just watch it for Optimus Prime - who is by far the true star. I just wish he was in it more. I've never felt so ashamed to be human!","Apr 7, 2019",6,/10
"I won't go into too much depth only because others here have put it much better than I would: This movie is horrible with a capital SUCKS. Of course, the same can be said about any Michael Bay film.If you haven't seen it yet I will only say this: Save your money. If you're desperate to spend $20 on something I suggest you pay someone to punch you in the stomach. You'll get the same feeling from this movie but at least you won't have to sit though 2 hours of utterly pointless film-making.How can Hollywood produce crap like this and then wonder why people illegally download films from the internet? Until someone starts making GOOD films that aren't just the same recycled trash that is forced down our throats that's what will continue. If you must see this film get it for free someplace (the library, the internet whatever) just don't spend a dime on this piece of moronic garbage.","Jul 18, 2007",1,/10
"My Take: Subtlety is not in the name of Michael Bay, but boring isn't either. ""Pump up the volume! I like that special effect, but make it look more real! Now, I like that shot, well done!"" That's what probably Michael Bay said repetitively, other than ""Action!"" and ""Cut!"", all throughout his latest summer blockbuster TRANSFORMERS, and when it is what you've come to hope for (big, glossy, silly and noisy), then TRANSFORMERS is the best, most anticipated and enjoyable rides of the summer. Does it live up to the hype? Never thought so before. When I saw the trailers and posters set up for advertising the film, I though this would just be another summer popcorn movie that's doing its job. I also though it would just be another exhibition of the newest line of special effects available at the department, something that director Michael ""Kaboom"" Bay is more comfortable to make.I stand corrected. While it is silly, dumb and has no ambition to write, TRANSFORMERS works on the levels where it should work. The action keeps viewers on the go, and under the watchful eye of exec. producer Steven Spielberg and his Dreamworks crew, TRANSFORMERS has touches of class (a class of its own that is). Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets himself involved into a plot to save the world when his ""new"" car turns out to be one of the Autobots, a race of machines set to save the earth from their enemies, the Decepticons. They're also in search of an object called the Allspark, also known as ""The Cube"" before the Decepticons rest their dirty hands on them, therefore fulfilling their plans for intergalactic supremacy. Along the way, the film juices up a few subplots including Sam flirting with the hottest chick in his school, played by model/actress Megan Fox. There's also subplots concerning a bunch of American soldiers (mainly Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson) and their families, but it's rarely exercised and almost utterly forgotten.TRANSFORMERS may not have much of a plot, and if it does, it feels like it's been written by a bunch of kids playing with their Transformers toys. But what's weak in plot is more than made up for pure summer movie entertainment. Bay booms up the sound system, making it quite possibly the loudest summer movie since Bay's own films like THE ROCK and BAD BOYS. The special effects are triumphant creations, making the famous gang of Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee and the lot far beyond their plastic toy origins. Every single rust and scratch is captured by the film's creative and industrious effects crew. The fights scenes, most especially during the early moments of the film are especially exciting. The problem that lies on its never-lacking amount of action is that in almost overstays its welcome. The film runs at about 144 minutes tops (that's more than 2 hours!), much too long for a movie that doesn't intend to make much sense. The film could have cut at least 30 minutes or so of special effects and have nothing to risk losing.Still, while surely not free of its flaws, TRANSFORMERS is everything you can ask for in a summer action entertainment. It may not offer anything more in bargain, but it deserves much credit for offering one of the better times I've experienced at the movies during the year.Rating: **** out of 5.","Jul 15, 2008",8,/10

"The cartoon series of many young men childhood finally made it to the big screen and my God was it entertaining. Transformers has a simple premise, two giant robot factions, the Auto bots and the Deceptions who were in the middle of a Civil War on their own planet and after it ends up being destroyed, continue their fight on Earth. The television series was really a marketing top to sell the toys, but to children we didn't care and it continued to other franchises like GI Joe, He-Man and Pokemon.The plot of the film focuses on Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), a teenage American student who happens to be selling some of his great grandfather's stuff on the eBay. He just brought his first car, a 1976 Chevrolet Camaro. But just happens to be to have brought a transformer. On the other side of the world the Deceptions start their war against humanity, attacking an American base in Qatar to access American military information. Their discover that Sam Witwicky's eBay may be of value to him, and the young man is thrown in the middle of the war, with Autobots coming to Earth to protect and Sam, and find the AllSpark that could bring life back to their home planet. At the same time is a sub-plot with Sam and his love interest Mikaela Barnes (Megan Fox). Sam is the school geek, whilst Mikaela the hotty that everyone wants to be with, but has a macho side to her. As the film progresses their friendship grows.Now that plot is paper thin, there is not hiding the fact. But the Cartoon was never that deep on plot anyway. The target audience for the film was always going to be teenage boys and young men, all they wanted to see was robots beating the hell out of each other and seeing Megan Fox doing some poll-dancing would have been a bonus. The film was too long, and should have cut at least 20 minutes. It takes too long to see the Autobots. The action is excellent. Michael Bay is a expert on bombastic action. He was a sound choice and combine military action, and giant robots and CGI to great effect. This was also the biggest film the American military got involved with since Black Hawk Down, which was good for the military, but made Transformers a jingoistic film. It was also a irony in the cartoon that the Deceptions happen to be military vechiles, whilst the Autobots were mostly sports cars. I do wonder what the film would have been like if someone like Spielberg, J.J. Abrams or Zack Synder directed, but Transformers is Bay best film so far. As well as action, there is comedy, some hit, some miss, but it has a good in-joke to one of Bay's previous film.The acting is standard. LeBeouf and Megan Fox have done alright for themselves after their work on television. Who really wins out is Peter Cullen who reprises his role as Optimus Prime. You got to love his voice and their is nothing more awe inspiring then seeing Optimus first scene.Other issues with the film is that there are too many characters, both human and Tranformers, which makes you lack caring for some of them or wondering where some people have come from. Some characters should have been cut or reduced, especially the Peneagon staff. Also their is too much product placement, the film was a giant ad for eBay and the car companies. It's ruins the film and should have been done in a more subtle manner. Also it ruined some Transformers like Jazz who was a Porsche in the cartoon, but a Pontiac Solstice in the film.But with all the issues aside, Transformers is a fun action blockbuster, and it sequel looks promising. Let's hope it's as good or even better.","May 14, 2009",8,/10

I am sure it will appeal as well to teenagers. i was waiting for the Auto-bots to unite and form a big robot! but didn't happen!!! great special effects...but thats is worthless if the story is crap. my brain was sleep for the whole thing!

"As a kid I was a huge fan of the auto-bots (my favorite character in the series - I guess he's everybody's favorite- was Optimus Prime). Man, I even had Optimus as a play toy. It was really cool seeing him transform into a truck with my one fingertips. Well, I don't want to get all mushy and stuff, so let's just say I really looked forward to see this new summer blockbuster.Having seen a lot of Michael Bay's movies, I was pretty sure the movie wouldn't lack the action scenes, but in my head arose two questions: could his team really make these fantastic robots look real? Would the story be OK? As to the first question, let me tell you that these robots really rook on the big screen. I must give the visual effects team huge credit, because they did their homework. The robots are amazing (I mean visually) and the battle scenes are breathtaking. In my opinion the movie has some of the best special effects since Matrix hit the box office.But I guess that this represents also the weak points of this movie. Once your eyes get accustomed to see the robots on screen, you realize that their personalities are very superficial and stereotyped. And their isn't really a plot, but that is for you to decide. I guess with all the action packed scenes, there wasn't much time for anything else. So, as I suspected, the answer to my second answer is a big NO.The + aspects of the movie: The action scenes, the visual design of the robots, the acting of Le Beuf, (he's really funny when he tries to impress Megan Fox with his new car) and some good chokes.The - aspects of the movie: no real plot, abuse of the action scenes, the humor get's silly and childish at times and not to forget the grandiloquent end speech of Optimus Prime, come on, is this for real) So my recommendation is, if you want to enjoy yourself, have some good laughs and see some cool actions scenes and over the top special effects without having to think a lot, than this movie is definitely made for you. But if you expect more, let's say a real story and some good characterization of the robots, think again. But hey, this is Hollywood at its best!!!","Aug 13, 2007",7,/10
"Michael Bay should be directing porn. He has one camera method for everything which is shaky camera. The plot is ludicrous, the female lead Megan Fox looks like a 38 year old Polish pole dancer. This film was so loud I couldn't even hear myself think and didn't have a clue what was going on. The film attempts emotional moments which it really never earned enough for them to make sense. This is the first time I have walked out of a theatre before the end of a film and I will be sending Mr Bay a letter demanding my £5.60 back I am actually disgusted that this film had an average of 7.8 and was on the IMDb top 250. (I have now seen that it has fallen to 7.7 and off the top 250 list, give yourselves a pat on the back people you are now karmically balanced!)","Aug 28, 2007",1,/10

"When I first saw it - even though it is geared for kids i could see it was geared for adults as well. Fun for all. Michael Bay got some scathing reviews from people who expected something else, but I saw remarkable CGI and greater potential and enough humor weaved into something that kids could watch. When I went to see it, they told me it was sold out. So I saw it later. Michael Bay is very good at what he does - he knows how to make a ""fun"" movie.","Nov 23, 2019",7,/10
"A movie that relies on CGI and attempts to cover all its deficiencies (weak plot, awful dialogs and bad acting) through computer generated animations surely does not deserve to be in the top 250. The first part of the movie was 'ok', which could barely deserve a 7, however the second part was no better than a Walt Disney movie based on the friendship of benevolent giant robots and kids. The tense atmosphere of the first part was gone and something not better than a well-designed video game demo came through. How can people be so generous in their votes is another question.

"Most people attend the movie theater to shut down their minds, becoming immersed in the diegesis of the film being viewed. This by all means is fine, as movies are made as an escape from reality. Transformers (2007) is a wonderful example of this as we are thrown into the plot, and forced to walk in the shoes of the characters. It's the director's job to captivate his/her audience, and Michael Bay definitely achieves this task. Michael Bay's directorial style in itself is what keeps his audience wide eyed and locked on the screen. Bay is an auteur, his style and personality reflected in all his films. Bay's style is very bold and his own, it's either you like it or you don't. Michael Bay's directorial style is fast edits and visually based (special effects). Having seen a few of Michael Bay's films, such as Armageddon (1998), Pearl Harbor (2001), Transformers (2007), The Unborn (2009), Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), I Am Number Four (2011) and Transformers: Dark of The Moon (2011), I have come to know Bay on a deeper, more personal level. Many of his films' genres are action, thriller and sci-fi, resulting in his trademark of numerous fast cuts and visually captivating effects. Transformers (2007) reflects Michael Bay's style in regards to its various action scenes, specifically the intense battles between the Autobots and the Decepticons. With Bay you get the full works: explosions, collisions, weapons, and simply everything action. One action packed scene would be the final battle in the city with all the robots. Elements such as the film's cinematography, editing, sound effects and the film's overall style reflects Bay's artistic style. Bay's camera angles and movements are very dynamic, for example his use of canted angles and high/low angles. A crucial aspect of Transformers cinematography would be the special effects, especially computer graphics in creating the robots and bullet time during action scenes. Two examples of bullet time effect would be when 1) Bonecrusher charged at Optimus on the highway scene and 2) In the city scene when Ironhide propelled himself upward to dodge two missiles. The editing in Transformers, as present in most of Bay's films, consists of fast cuts galore. Bay's editing style is ""BAM! Look here! BAM! Look over there! BAM! What's that?!"" There is no slowing down in pace and therefore no room for thinking, just pure entertainment. Most of Bay's sound effects comprise of non-diegetic mood music and sound effects. The mood music is usually suspenseful, intense and/or exciting, paralleling the incredible visual effect. Sound effects are especially used in the action scenes, (the explosions, collisions, etc) and also in regards to the transformation of the robots. In regards to Bay's other films Transformers is similar in the fact that it's high energy and has stunning visuals. Though his films may not be visionary and plot oriented Bay gives the audience what they want, entertainment. A particular scene that portrays the strongest impression of Bay's personality would have to be the final battle scene in the city between the Autobots and Decepticons. This scene has everything an action scene should have and that's exactly why it reflects Bay. Bay is not a slow paced, quiet guy, but innovative and bursting of energy. A quote by the actor Ben Affleck, who starred in both Armageddon and Pearl Harbor states, ""I think Michael is actually an auteur in the true sense of the word. Every movie he makes reflects his personal creative vision. You may like it, you may not—but those movies are him without compromise. There's something to be said for sticking to your guns."" Transformers does not suggest any type of growth in a new direction away from his other films. Bay's films are what they are and cannot be recreated. Either you hate or love Michael Bay's directorial style, and I love it. It's enjoyable, entertaining and visually captivating, everything a movie should be.","Nov 29, 2011",8,/10
"For the last week all I've heard is that I should ""GO SEE TRANSFORMERS!!!"" from by friends and from people on TV etc. I really didn't think that it lived up to the hype.The special effects were incredible, and that asset alone is why I gave this movie a 7.I usually don't mind unrealistic movies like aliens, robots, or superhero type films. I can accept the fact that these things can do super human type things or unrealistic type things. But when humans start doing stunts that just aren't realistic at all, I just start to lose a bit of my interest. Some of the lines and scenes just seemed completely awkward or un-needed. The script could have been a little cleaner and a few scenes could have been left out (i.e. tooth-fairy) The movie is pretty long too, or at least it seemed like it. I love going to the movies and sitting down for a long time and soaking up the excitement, but in this case I thought it might have dragged on a little too far. This really didn't have too much of an effect on my rating, but I thought I'd throw it in.I'm glad I saw this movie (more like got forced to from all the hype). The special effects are pretty sweet and the plot isn't too bad. I wouldn't pay to see it again like some other movies I've seen recently.","Jul 8, 2007",7,/10
"This movie was genuinely fantastic. You would think that the concept itself- sentient robots that fell out of the sky- would put this way out there on the ridiculous sci-fi side, but I'm telling you, it does not feel that way at all.The cast and acting were solid, and I loved all of the transformers themselves. Considering the timeframe, they had a solid amount of depth.Visually, this movie was INCREDIBLE. For being 17 years old, I absolutely cannot believe the level of CGI. This, paired with all the great fight scenes and action, made for such a visually appealing watch.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and can definetly recommend it. Final score of 8.7/10.","Jul 27, 2024",9,/10
"I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but this one, in spite of all the flaws, surprised me for good. Yet, unfortunately, like almost of all action movies that i've seen, the bad guys must be benevolent and retardos in order for all the good guys win (i call this the ""Syndrome Of The Action Movies""!). It just repulses me!Generally, and although there's a lot of parts that are predictable and look somewhat forcible (like, for example, the platonic romance between Mikaela and Sam), the movie provides a good all-around touch of genres: drama and some romance (without being too lame), comedy, thrilling moments and especially, of course, the constant amazing action scenes. The jewels of the crown are the spectacular sound and special effects present in all the movie that are way(!) above the average, and they just make the movie worth of being seen.","Aug 7, 2007",7,/10
"Where was all the Transformer vs Transformer action?!?!!?!? Yea Optamus fighting Bonecrusher was bad ass, but other than that where the hell was Transformer ass kicking?!?!!? The movie starts off with Blackout kicking major human ass all the while taking gun fire grenades missiles and so forth just like it was nothing. Then at the end hes sissified and gets taken out by one human with a grenade launcher??!?!? Then in the ""grand"" showdown between Optamus and Megatron, I didn't see Optamus get so much as one good punch in!?!?! He just got his ass handed to him like some kind of cry baby just saying ""just kill me. just kill me with the cube."" Wtf was that &%$#?!?!?! And where did Barricade go? Isn't Ironhide supposed to be the Autobot ass kicker? Why was he running like chicken &*$# with Ratchet?

"For those who like this type of movie it is two hours of action and entertainment pure. It is some kind of Alien Vs. Predator not pretending anything different than what presented. Special effects are amazing, especially the transforming ones and the idea of the film is also not bad. The hiding of the transformers with eventual destruction of the garden is funny, but their stupid way of talking and behaving is so typical of a certain country in the world. Typical clichés are presented (cars, romantic sunrise etc.). However talking about live cars, the beetle was much more original. The way the protagonist gets to know her is not very convincing. They could have done something more creative. All in All this movie is typical American, some kind of fast food movie, no substance and a lot of artificial effects.","Aug 3, 2007",6,/10
"i cant believe Stephen Spielberg would allow his name to be associated with that flaming pile of crap. some one should be punished for taking something with so much potential and ruining it like that. The special effects were average. but the plot, storyline, character development, (all the things you need for a good movie) sucked. If they were going to spend the whole budget on just effects then they should have really been more impressive then they were. Megan Fox was hot, but all they did was slow motion close ups on her.and people who specialize in breaking complex codes don't look like that Australian girl.i like the eye candy as much as anyone, but it was cheesy.","Jul 13, 2007",1,/10
"When Transformers first came out nearly 10 years ago during the 4th of July weekend, no one excepted it to be as big as it is today, although the hype has kinda slowed down a bit due to other big movies and the rise of the Superhero genre. This movie introduced Megan Fox to the male masses and showed how tough Shia LeBouf can be after his debut in Holes. I'm glad they used Peter Cullen's voice as Optimus Prime and the detail to the robots and the sound effects is pure magic. The music is well done, and the plot is simple: Autobots vs Decepticons for possession of the ALl Spark, a mysterious object that is lost in time. I first saw it in theaters and liked it a lot. The sequels, especially the second one, lacked the imagination and humor of the first one.","Jun 5, 2017",10,/10

"I thought this movie was very entertaining in many ways. It brought back many good memories from the transformers cartoon from my childhood. The movie is very well done in terms of acting, plot, action sequences, and special effects. It has a great combination of action, humor, tragedy,and suspense from start to finish. The choice of cars for each Autobot as well as the vehicles chosen for the Decepticons was perfect. This is a true clash between good versus evil. I loved hearing Peter Cullen perform the voice of Optimus Prime once again! I also believe Shia Lebouf did a great job as well. If you desire to see an excellent action-packed movie (even if you are not a transformers fan), then definitely see this movie. Great job Michael Bay on a work of excellence! I am looking forward to #2!","Mar 2, 2008",8,/10
"Well, i grew up watching the Transformers cartoon after school everyday. So I was familiar with all of the characters and I knew all of the back story.The movie did a horrible job of setting up new fans on the complete story of Transformers, but I know sequels will be made and more transformer revelations will be made then.Before I start my review do you even remember the theme song for transformers. Sure you all know this part ""Transformers More than meets the eye Transformers Robots in Disguise""But there is an actually an entire song by a group called Lion. So for those that are mad that I gave the movie a 7, if you don't know as much about transformers than I do, you get a juice box stick a straw in it and suck it!Tranformers the movie is really amazing. I was blown away by how much CG effect has grown through the years. The robots fighting in the downtown shots were worth the price of admission. Many guys will like the movie for the action shot, hot cars, robots, and Megan Fox. It's one of the movie that I know both girls and guys will like, whether or not they know anything about Transformers. When they leave the movie they will be fans.The movie did drag in several places, but overall it was good. So let me know what you think. The last movie critic who still pays the price of admission.","Nov 1, 2007",7,/10
"I am not sure how deep exactly a director is involved in the technical production of a movie of this scope, but whether it's him, whether it's the people working with him, someone on Bay's sets knows how to assure production quality. I usually do not give too much credit for how a movie generally looks and is made, as stuff for this can be learned and bought. But in this special case production value is so incredibly high that it emerges from its original place and becomes a separate art form. One might take stuff like this for granted, but just freeze the movie for a moment and try to sum up how many people have been working for countless hour on that frame to make it look like it does now, meaning not just the action parts but even the most simple scenes. Fortunately, all this reaches it's climax when it comes to the robots as the CGI applied here is just staggering. I recommend the biggest screen available to you, as the level of detail is mind blowing and has to be presented in the highest resolution possible for you to be able to get just a part of what is happening all together. Also, this provides the movie with a pretty high re-watch value, the scenes featuring the Transformers can be rewinded several times to discover new things happening on the screen every time.Now while the rest is pretty forgettable I must admit, it kind of works for most of the time. Shia LeBoef might not be academy material, but the way he seems to be on drugs for the majority of the movie is kind of entertaining. Ms.Fox doesn't need to do anything for me, I'd give her any award she likes. The Bay-specific humor deliberately smashed in to make this family friendly borders at slapstick at times but I admit actually having fun with it now and then. Also it's full of plot holes and banal script writing mistakes but then again it has Megan Fox's ass.Now Undoubtedly this is a Michael Bay vehicle and all this by itself could still be unwatchable, but the thing is, there are some unexpectedly good scenes and moments. I wouldn't have dared to hope for anything as dark and thrilling as the first scene with the decepticon attacking the military base, which was a genuine cinema moment for me, something I thought would have been extinguished by know. And though the movie never goes there again, with a few other moments and the transformation effects and Megan Fox's legs I am willing to forgive a lot of crap here. Even some of the stupid things that are severely effecting the movies quality which could have been easily avoided.So the movie is called Transformers and this is exactly what you get and technically produced in the most awesome way imaginable. The rest, while banal at times is actually entertaining, so you know... whatever... for what it is: 9/10","Jun 19, 2011",9,/10
"...ok, where were we...the purpose of the movie was to ENTERTAIN the masses; well done, Spielberg did it, no doubt, but as every SF and action movie this days, ""Transformers"" has stupid, but correctable mistakes and errors...for example: why would the secretary of defense(Voight) send the endangered ""package""(the Cube) to the city where alive people live, when they know that the Decepticons are after it and they know what they can do; to sacrifice the people?...second: the scene where Mikaela drives Bumblbee through the city was really stupid and unimportant, I mean, find me a girl that would do such a stupid thing!...third: how is it possible that a 1.78 meters tall man, managed to put the Cube into the chest of a killing machine 20 meters tall?...there is a lots of things that I didn't like in the movie, but I am still too euphoric and under the influence of the special effects... ...ahhh, f... it, I'm going tomorrow to the cinema to watch it again... I expect you'll do the same...","Jul 1, 2007",7,/10
"I was really disappointed by this movie. A large part of it is because I brought my 9 year old son. Transformers were originally for 9-year-olds, so I figured he would like it. He even has a collection of transformers. At any rate, the sexual content in the movie alienated him and diminished his enjoyment of the movie. I guess they only care about the people who were 9 ten years ago.I found the movie really lacking in key areas such as writing and acting. The dialog was terrible. The special effects were about the only thing that were good. I have no idea how something like this gets an 8.2 average rating, except hyped teens remembering how much fun their transformer fantasy play was. It certainly doesn't represent the quality (or lack) of the movie.","Jul 8, 2007",3,/10

"Why are they pushing me to get horny for a 16 year old? What the heck was that movie about? Why is ALL the physics so wrong? You can stand a fall from space but not (relatively) minor temperature or pressure fluctuations? You are light as a feather until you transform, when you can break asphalt with your footsteps? ALL the dialog is that rapid fire whining, typical of a Woody Allen movie. Most of all, when the action was happening, who was the bad guys and who was the good guys? If only you had let a Japanese writer do the story, maybe it would have made some sense. In a movie geared around action, the action was incomprehensible in the second half of the movie. Please, please, no sequel.","Jul 14, 2007",5,/10

"Pretty good yarn with lots of visual and audible stuff going on that you can never really put your finger on. Gears twirl, shafts slide, hinges fold and unfold but you cannot really discern what the heck is happening until the robot actually becomes the vehicle or vice versa. Meanwhile, metallic sounds grind, whirl, sproing and groan during the transformation. It's all pretty good stuff and, I guess, represents the next generation of CGI potential. Shia LeBeouf (?) is very good as the star in this and someone to keep your eye on for future projects. He was amusing as the trash talking kid/friend of Will Smith in ""I, Robot"", and I enjoyed him in that very minor role. ""Transformers"" has hot vehicles and hot girls and is generally appealing. The plot is good and unfolds well. Sound effects are superior and it would be well worth seeing this film in a movie house with a wiz-bang sound system if you DO decide to see it in the theater.","Aug 12, 2007",6,/10

"Let's face it, when working for Steven Spielberg, Michael Bay could make an entertaining movie about a guy peeling a potato. We're into some serious trade-craft with these guys. From effects to casting to pacing -- as something to take your mind off your troubles for a couple hours, you could do a lot worse than this spectacle based on a children's TV show.The new Michael Bay film ""Transformers"" chronicles the adventures of a race of alien mechanical lifeforms and their human allies as they seek to deprive less enlightened Transformers of control over a magic cube that can turn a toaster into a terminator. Sound stupid? Oh, you bet it is.But when a Blackhawk helicopter lands at a U.S. military base and then ""transforms"" into a giant lumbering robot that lays waste to everything in its path, with effects so realistic as to be eye-popping, the menace was palpable and frightening.Along the way we get your standard boy-and-his-dog, boy-and-his-Camaro, come-from-behind Woody-Allenesque tale of some dippy nerd who manages to woo the hottest hottie away from the football jock in an earnest v. yearnless 2-scene battle of puny proportions a la every Hollywood script ever written.But if you pair your giant killer robots up with an absurdly appealing Megan Fox as the hottie in question, you are gonna have a hard time making a movie 99 out of a hundred American men are not going to enjoy. And goofy though it was, I'd have to count myself among the 99. It was a good time at the movies and there's just no two ways about it.Here's a few things I think they could have done differently:First, the volume and mass of the robots seems off when they ""transform"" into vehicles and back again. When they're robots they seem much bigger than the vehicles they can turn into. If you stood a Camaro on end and give it some legs, it seems you'd only achieve half the height of the robot we're seeing. But I'm probably just being picky.Second, I understand it's desirable to have expressive faces of some kind, but if these alien creatures can morph into roughly any manufactured piece of equipment, wouldn't they just grow speakers instead of anthropomorphic mouths with which to speak? Just splitting hairs, here.Third, the processes and scope of evolution are probably far vaster than even our smartest smart guys can fathom but it seems HIGHLY dubious that a race of machines could evolve without, presumably, the impetus of some organic life form initiating it. But hey, I guess in a nearly infinite universe, the possibilities are similarly infinite.And last but not least, these machine warriors, sadly, are probably playing heroes to a segment of the U.S. population's children growing up without a lot of moral or intellectual curiosity around them. These kids will grow up asking themselves what would ""Optimus Prime"" do when Billy from the trailer next door steals my Slurpee at the NASCAR trials. You know, when dad's passed out on Meth and mom's working her third job, kids face these dilemmas. And this is why you have to be careful with what you show these potential heroes doing and how they treat their enemies.And THIS is why you probably don't want to include a scene in which, after subduing a group of humans, a giant robot pees on one of them by way of compelling cooperation. And though it's played for laughs, like it or not, this is a real way the coarsening of our culture happens -- one mean-spirited movie scene played-for-laughs at a time. It's funny when it happens to a bad guy in the movies. It's not so funny when you're being mugged or car-jacked and the perpetrator decides he'll throw in an homage to the latest Transformers film and starts unzipping his fly. State Farm can replace your Lexus, but not your dignity. Spielberg oughta know better.Did I mention the movie has Megan Fox?","Jul 23, 2007",6,/10

"I so badly wanted to give this film a ten. How could a story about huge transforming robots fighting be anything but cool. I know that sounds geeky but it's true.Well the answer is that the transformers are, as expected, bit parts to the humans. Of course the human side needs to be told, it is easier to relate to humans than robots after all. Unfortunately there is little characterisation of either Autobots or Decepticons. Minor side plots for unimportant characters take up more time than the 'bots which in my mind weakened the story. On the plot side of things, the story is pretty weak and contrived but I wasn't expecting anything special.Most summer blockbusters feel the need to cover all bases, action, love story etc. and Transformers falls into the same trap of adding poor childish and inappropriate humour. Making comedy characters out of Jazz and even Optimus at times doesn't work and had me shaking my head in disbelief. Now you may be wondering why I scored this film eight out of ten as I keep slating it. The answer is simple, the subject matter is so good that it would have been hard to mess up. The grin that appears every time a 'bot transforms stays for ages. Every fight scene looks great if a little bit shaky. I'm not one to be wowed by fancy cgi and explosions but Bay has done well this time. There is a sense of size, bulk and power behind each Transformer that helps you feel every blow.In spite of all the negative comments, I really enjoyed the film and I recommend it to every one. If you see it, see it in the cinema.Now all we can hope is that the sequel concentrates on the title characters a bit more. After all that is what we all want to see the film for isn't it?","Jul 22, 2007",6,/10
"Ooops, I'm sorry, I didn't write an actually summary in the ""summary"" line. Well, here's an accurate summary of this film: BOOM! BANG! SMASH! CRASH! EXPLOSION! KABOOM! That's all. That's it. That's the film.A couple hundred million dollars spent on CGI and visuals, with a script that was ostensibly written by a couple of kindergarten kids with crayons. Absolutely no real plot, zero character development, a lead character that even a mother couldn't love (yet we're supposed to root for him), and a ridiculously undeveloped love story that makes even the most superficial romantic comedies look good. And let's not forget the horrendously bad dialogue; I died a million deaths when I heard the transformers uttering phrases such as ""My bad"", and ""what's up my bitches"". And let's not to mention the abhorrent product placement (ebay shelled out big money to be advertised here, I'm sure!).""We learned English from the world wide web."" -- Optimus PrimeThis film is STRICTLY for people who love brainless CGI laden smash-em-up films.","Oct 31, 2007",1,/10

"""Transformers"" is undeniably a visual feast of CGI-enhanced, over-the-top action. Character development and a compelling storyline are lacking in the film. Like many overhyped films, I grew tired of hearing how great it was. It's just another big-bang film with no real story to tell.The Camaro isn't the only disguised robot that's made its way to Earth. On Earth, Optimus Prime and Megatron are both looking for the same AllSpark.""Transformers"" tells three stories in parallel before bringing them together for the dramatic climax. With so many plots, you'd assume it'd be a jam-packed film full of gripping, intricate tales. Instead, they exist solely to serve as a vehicle for all of the set-piece action.""Transformers"" is mostly a visual effects-driven film. The focus of ""Transformers"" is on special effects-laden action rather than story telling. With the rare action pause, the film begins to lull due to a lack of substance to fill in the gaps.""Transformers"" is a film that is a bit of a mixed bag. It is a mix of good and bad for me.

"Again a great movie I missed till it came to DVD. Sigh. Tranformers, re-imagined by director Michael Bay, is loud, funny and fast. Its a perfect popcorn movie and a real feast for the eyes. And no, I don't just mean Megan Fox. The effects in the movie are some of the best I've ever seen, truly good and utterly convincing. Of course the characters reactions aren't always so real, but hey its a summer movie.For anyone unfamiliar with the toys from Hasbro or the ludicrously popular cartoon from the 80's, this is probably confusing. Hence Optimus Prime delivers the prologue himself. Very cool, even cooler its still Peter Cullen doing the voice. Kudos to the film's makers for that. I did miss Starscream and Megatron but I think those performers might be dead. Hugo Weaving did a nice job as Megatron.Shia Lebouef, awful name but nice kid, does well as Sam, he really carries the film at times. Megan Fox is the love interest here and I take umbrage with any complaints about her acting, you try acting in a piece like this! She was smoking hot and very convincing to me. So there. To those who said there was no plot or development, did you actually watch this movie? C'mon, Mikhala is pretty shallow till she meets Sam and she proves her mettle by hanging with him in this crazy situation. Remember the line, ""get in the car""? She did, remember that.Optimus looks great and the Bumblebee Camaro is awesome. I love the in-jokes, especially the one about ""Armageddon"" this movie had me laughing and cheering, just like a popcorn movie should! My only complaint was I thought the final battle was slightly off, not bad, just should have been bigger, less stupid extras and more demolition. Other than that it was great. Oh, one other complaint, other than the great old songs used by Bumblebee in the beginning of the film, lousy music score, oh well. Still a great flick.","Jan 1, 2008",7,/10

"The pace of this movie is ambitious. So much happens. Sometimes it sounds a little simple, even a little lame in a few spots, but never for very long. The jokes range from decent to pretty damn funny. Shia is great, even Megan is doing a solid job. John My Neighbor Totoro is hilarious as hell. And the action is only mildly annoying when it goes too far, which is more than I can say for the 30 sequel movies we got after this. Often the action is pretty cool and creative. Especially in the scenes where the Autobots, who have sworn not to harm humans, must find ways to either incapacitate or hide from government agents in pursuit of them. Bay's obsession with the military seems appropriate enough for the subject matter, I suppose. I mean, it's Transformers. It's not THAT great, duh. But it's more than good enough for what it's trying to be.","Jul 11, 2024",7,/10
"This is a great example of a film that suffered at the editor's hands. They could have cut out about 45 minutes and made this a 7 star film. The last half hour, all that ran through my head was, ""C'mon already."" Special effects-- Yes, there are plenty. But the transformations of the transformers, as well as the fight scenes, are all blurred and framed with jittery or unsee-able distances. By the time you see the third transform, you've seen them all. The best scenes, IMO, happened in the first 1/2 hour.Characterization-- For the most part, tedious. You have Hollywood's versions of the typical hormone-packed high school dweeb trying to win the hot chick (played by Shia LaBeouf with no little amount of over-acting). You have his clueless, manipulable, imbecile parents who care mostly about their lawn. You have high ranking befuddled government officials (although Jon Voight does the part as much justice as can be done). You have a super-secret service contingency, filled with unlikeable, smarmy characters (headed by John Turturro who is the most mis-cast in all this movie). On the positive side, Duhamel does a good job maintaining a sense of coherency representing the US fighting soldiers. The highlight was Bernie Mac's cameo as a used-car salesman.Plot-- Plenty of it, with good aliens vs evil aliens, and humans doing their best to help out (although I couldn't help but feel it would have gone better for the good guys if the humans just got out of the way). You can pretty much guess what's going to happen after the first 15 minutes, so you're left to just sit there and watch it unravel, through the thin dialog and in-your-face effects.All in all, got a few smiles and chuckles, but unlike War of the Worlds, I couldn't wait for this film to finally end.","Jul 8, 2007",4,/10

"Transformers is a movie that makes you go ""WHOA!"" when you first see it. When you calm down from the high you come to realise that in the end ""it is just an action movie"". But a very good action movie none the less.Fans of the toy-line and cartoons series should be proud. Michael Bay has brought us a formidable adaption with the best CGI money can buy and crunched out a story that isn't too corny for the average viewer and which also combines great action and special effects with tons of silly humour which prevents the film, in all its massiveness, from becoming horrifically dull.The film also has a well executed human-story, but by the end of it you kinda realise that this stuff was really intended for the kids. None the less, Transformers is a formidable piece of cinema, not a life-changing movie, but one that both kids and parents ought to like.Transformers have arrived.","Jul 8, 2007",7,/10

"When I heard that a live action adaptation of Transformers was being made I was beside myself. And as the release date drew nearer i couldn't wait. I was much the same about Alien v Predator, and likewise I knew that both films were likely to be utter pap but at the same time, lots of fun. I mean let's be honest, Transformers was never going to be the Citizen Kane of the 2007 summer blockbusters but it failed in so many ways I left the cinema feeling disappointed.Bad points:* Bad characters - what was the point of the Australian 'analyst' and her hacker friend? She was clearly just some eye-candy and he was ham-fisted unfunny comic relief. * Bad editing - too many pointless set pieces. What was the point of the interrogation of the Aussie woman and the hacker? None except for a unfunny comedic set piece. * The best comic book adaptation ones have been the ones which focused on the darker side to the main characters (ie Batman Begins, Spiderman). Obviously with the Autobots (esp Optimus) being such goody two-shoes this wasn't going to be an option. However making so many of the characters out to be comic side-shows took away so much of the gravitas that the characters had from the comics. Megatron was a bad dude not as much because he looked bad, but because he was utterly ruthless, not just with his victims but with his own followers. and we didn't really get a sense of this in the film. * Little dramatic weight - the sequence where Bumblebee is captured drew no empathy from the audience as we simply hadn't got to care about the character that much at that point. * John Turturo - why was such a great actor given such a pansy ass role? * Action sequences - too confusing. When there were hand-to-hand combat fights it was hard to tell who was who, is that a Decepticon or an Autobot? Too hard to tell! * Bumblebee was a VW Beetle!!!Good points:* errmmm... the CGI was impressiveSeriously that is the best i can really say about it. The most I can give Transformers realistically is 6/10, and it pains me to do so. Mind you when you look at Michael Bay's filmography is it any real surprise?","Jul 22, 2007",6,/10

Animation is brilliant, cast is awesome, soldiers mix fear bravery and humor in such a fantastic way it gets really funny LEFT CHEEK, LEFT CHEEK :)Everyone in this movie, every SINGLE PERSON gave their touch to whole flick.

"OK, I understand that I am not exactly the target demographic for this film. (Over sixteen) But my take on it is that is it is neither as good as some people say it is, nor as bad as others say it is. I know nothing of the cartoons or toys that are supposed to be the base here, and thus cannot comment on ""being true to source material."" But some of the characters (such as Sam, Mikeala) were decent, some of the others (such as Turturro, Sam's parents, Bernie Mac) were utter caricatures. Megan Fox looked very good. IL & M did what they do with CGI. I'm sure it was visually impressive on the big screen. If you take this film for what it is, it is mildly entertaining even if you aren't a kid. If you expect the movie to be something it's not, you will be sorely disappointed.","Apr 20, 2009",6,/10

"Transformers (2007) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a young man who is broke but wants a new car to help him get the girl of his dreams. He doesn't get the car of his dreams but is still shooting his shot at the girl. He quickly discovers the car is more than meets the eye and he will need to partner with it to save the world...maybe he does have a shot with the girl.This movie is directed by Michael Bay (Bad Boys) and stars Shia LaBeouf (Fury), Megan Fox (Jennifer's Body), Josh Duhamel (Safe Haven), Tyrese Gibson (Baby Boy), Anthony Anderson (The Departed), Jon Voight (Deliverance), John Turturro (Fear X) and Rachael Taylor (See No Evil).When this movie first came out and I heard the transformers changing sound effects I got goosebumps. The sound effects and soundtrack in this movie are perfection. The storyline is great as is how they introduce the transformers. The voices are well selected to play both the heroes and villains. The cast is well selected. I loved Bernie Mac and Megan Fox was gorgeous. The action scenes are stupendous and absolutely outstanding. Every transformation and shootout is fantastic, from the military base opening to the ending scenes in the city are all awesome.Overall, this is a well put together addition to the action genre that captures the cartoon look and feel brilliantly. I would score this a 8/10 and strongly recommend it.","Aug 28, 2022",8,/10
"Let me start of by saying that Jon Voight was by far the cheesiest cliché wearing brass I have seen lately why him, his acting alone brought the movie down 2 stars down. Talk about a shameless marketing plug Hasbro placed quite a few of their toy lines in the film, for what reason. They already a giant CG toy line come to life. How many cliché lines can Bay fill a movie with, that might be the Bay's true goal. Maybe one of his future movies will have actual actor dialog to replace the 30 second TV commercial dialog that just inundates this entire movie. Why did Michael Bay insist on putting lips on Prime even though he rarely spoke it seemed like none of the Transformers rarely spoke. Bay have you heard of character development. But the battles between the bots were cool. Its still a watchable movie. One shall stand, one shall fall.But why couldn't Bay take the fall.","Jul 9, 2007",6,/10

"Or the plotholes and the cringy dialogues will torture you. It has decent CGI and the music is fine.It often feels like an ad for the army. Probably a return in favor for all the stuff they used.Explosion, fireworks, bots battling each other. Often so much you can't really tell what is happening or who is who.A movie for teens.","May 9, 2022",6,/10
"I haven't watched this one in ages, and I forgot how great this was! This is what a blockbuster should be! It has amazing action, great characters, a surprising amount of humor, and a bit of heart. Michael Bay is just one of those directors, with a gift for visual storytelling. He can create some amazing action shots and sequences. I had such a fun time whenever the Transformers was in battle. That leads me into my biggest complaint. This is more of a human story than a Transformers movie. Don't get me wrong, I think the human characters were great. It's just that the Transformers action doesn't really start until an hour into the film. However, everything after that makes up for the wait. It truly is awesome.","Aug 25, 2024",8,/10
"Consider Michael Bay the William McGonagall of film: the worst there is. Fortunately, even the worst at what they do can do something right from time to time, such as with ""Transformers"".Pros: stunning visuals; good acting from half of the cast; snappy dialogue and wit, especially from Shia LaBeouf; some really good laughs; diverse characterization of the AutobotsCons: bad acting from the other half of the cast, especially Megan Fox; cheesy plot; some meaningless closeups; flat characterization of the DecepticonsBottom line: If you're looking for anything more than things going kablooey every 10 seconds, you'll be surprised to find something more-- if not much--in this romp. The saga of the Transformers sure starts with a big bang, doesn't it?","Jun 8, 2014",6,/10
"I remeber going to see this the first weekend it was released. I lined up with all the nerds, geeks and kids by myself. None of my friends wanted to go. I had a great time, and really enjoyed all the eye popping special effects crazy scenes of action and wacky humor. It introduced me to Shia LaBoufe and Megan Fox. I was really drawn in by the whole spectacle. Unfortunately, it was hugely successful, and spawned a whole glut of sequels, each worse than the rest, but this one still stands out to me...great fun.","Aug 6, 2018",8,/10

"Let's get one thing straight: this movie was dreadful. It's best summed up by this: Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox, there to look good in some dramatic pose, extreme lighting, and a disappointing absence of Transformers. All they had to do was make a movie with Transformers fighting each other. Instead, they had to complicate it with technical drivel, completely unnecessary characters, and retarded justification sequences which left you wondering how writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman got through life without getting beat up around every corner. Michael Bay can make an action flick, and that's all he had to do here. Instead, he tried to complicate things. When this is a movie called Transformers and there are hour long gaps between transformer on transformer action, you know you have a real problem.The CG in this movie was amazing... when it was on screen. Literally one hour passed before we saw the first transformer battle (albeit was awesome) and almost another hour before the final sequence. When people say it's a 2 and a half hour trailer for ILM, they are sorely mistaken. This was a 25 minute trailer for ILM pasted into a drearily dull and pointless story. Another problem with the CG was the complication of robot design, coupled with the ambiguity of color and design from all the other robots and a constantly tight camera shot, made it impossible to distinguish between how many transformers were on screen or who was fighting who. Only after the battle do you know who you're rooting for.The script was terrible. The lines were gag-reflex bad, and the story, if observed with any sort of intelligence, was a wasteful tack-on with no thought put in.Also a huge disappointment was the acting. Shia LaBeouf, Jon Voight, John Turturro- these actors have all shown us some great performances in the past, which only contributes to the argument that this script and direction were atrocious. The delivery on the already poor lines brought me out of the experience every time someone opened there mouth. But the worst part is most of the humans featured in this film didn't even need to exist. The ""new guys"" that were brought in to isolate the hack the stupid monkey terminator (I'll come back to him later) were some of the stiffest acting of this year, and they didn't even need to be there. At all.The absolute worst aspect of the movie was the monkey/boom box transformer. Or so they made him to be. That was no transformer. It was written and animated like a bad droid from Episode 1, and I don't see how anyone could have been fooled by the disguise. His part in the story was far too crucial, and his on-screen time compared to characters Optimus Prime and Megatron was so incredibly disappointing, I thought George Lucas was a pinch director for much of the movie.About the only sight-gag I found to be humorous was a dangling decoration in Bumblebee's car saying ""Bee-otch"". The humor was shallow, and at it's best got me chuckling.It was such a relief after an hour, to see the first real battle, and I was so engaged the moment it happened. The first fight was between Bumblebee as a Camaro, and Barricade as a police interceptor. Though it kind of bothered me that he had such a tricked-out police car, really, it didn't matter. This fight was cool, and actually had worth to it. Likewise, the last 20 minutes of the movie were engaging, and the human aspect went from bad to just okay (a sequence between LaBeouf and Fox was very out-of-no where, but it was totally a Bay moment). When the film's subjects, transformers, were on screen, it was the right movie. Too bad they were only on for about 10% of the time...Honestly, this is the first movie I have ever wanted to walk out in. I didn't care about the story at all, after about 10 minutes, I couldn't even care about sticking around for the action, if it ever came. I also seem to be the only one who feels this way, and I am deeply saddened to all who were brainwashed by Michael Bay and his stranglehold. Please listen to reason, and wait for this to rent. When you only have to spend about a dollar a piece on the thing.A final note, this is not a kids movie, like the new TMNT. If you are looking for a kids movie, turn back now. The story is too convoluted, the action is few and far between, and the subject matter and action are just plain not suited for children.","Jul 8, 2007",3,/10

"Wow, I am not going to lie, I always forget how awesome this movie is!!! Like that Yellow 2008 Chevrolet Camaro was my dream car my whole childhood, and Megan Fox was my dream girlfriend too 😅😅😅 But the comedy isn't bad, the action is really good and the special effects still hold up really well. I forgot how much action was in it honestly, like there is a lot, and like I said, it's really well done! Like I am always entertained whenever I watch it. I honestly still feel pumped up after having seen it so much 😅😅 But I really do miss when Shia LeBeouf was big in Hollywood. Like my Nostalgia Goggles where really strong loving back in it.

"The truth is this film has little to do with the Transformers characters. It's a story about a BOY who befriends the girl of his dreams, and his car happens to be robot!

It's like having a DaVinci exhibition, and only showing a Boeing 747.Progress is fine, Bumblebee could've been the new VW Beetle, no??? If Megatron can't transform into a hand gun -explain the cube?Spielberg, What happened? You used to make GOOD films. Don't tell me you needed the money?

"A revolutionary action film that ticks all the boxes of your typical summer blockbuster and then some! The cgi and special effects are even better than most films released in 2018 with similar or larger budgets at their disposal. The film that spawned the critically panned yet adored franchise of 5 soon to be reinvigorated by ""bumblebee"" later this year, as of right now it is an overused formula however at the time this absolute marvel of a film was unique, a breath of fresh air.

"The start of the bayformers is the best of the bunch. This has the least convoluted plot and the story is the most grounded out of all them. This has the most resemblance to the 80s Spielberg movies, with the boy who connects with this alien car and desperately wants the prettiest girl in the class. It actually takes a lot of time (1h30min) before we get to meet all of the transformers, such as the noble leader Optimus Prime. But therefore we get to connect with Sam Witwicky (Shia La Beouf) in his nerdy eccentric teenage era of movies. He has a lot of charm in this role and you could see why Spielberg asked Bay to get him as the lead. The other characters are also interesting. Although the narratives offers a lot of subplots, they are all interesting especially all the stuff with the military. Simmons (John Turtorro) is doing his usual weird stuff but his character has an good role in the middle act of the movie. The most intense and exciting scenes are the ones with the young government hackers led by Maggie (Rachel Taylor) who is finding that the evil decepticons is behind the scenes.I would say this movie balances humour better than the rest of the sequels. We get some of the crazy Bay humour, but we are not entirely watching the sex juvenile humour that Revenge of the fallen had. Shia La Beouf and Anthony Anderson was the comedic highlights.Like all these action extravaganza movies the last act is pure spectacle and war. But this one has the smallest scale in terms of destruction which says something when Bay levels an entire city. We get some cool scenes with Optimus vs Megatron but the action coreaography was very rapid and quick qutting which made it hard to follow. But this is solid popcorn entertainment done right, and Bay did the action set-pieces well.Considering this came out in 2007 the CGI is amazing. ILM really nailed it with the visuals in this franchise and although it gets better in each movie this was the one who introduced it. The best part is the literal transformation scenes. The first scene when the chopper reveals to be an decepticon and when we see the full scale of Optimus transformation. That was something that was lacking in the sequels, that this movie took the time with its humans and robots and the story.","Oct 18, 2020",8,/10
"There was a lot of build up for this move, but I believed it to be warranted. As not only Micahel Bay was the one directing, but the great Steven Spielberg was involved as well. While standing in line to see it, I told myself, ""There is no way this could be bad."".Walking out of the movie theater, I thought about what I had said while walking in, and wondered just how they had screwed this up. After all, the action scenes were great, and the special effects were top notch. There was nary a dull moment throughout the entire film. The acting was good for the most part. They were talking to robots.. that has to be hard to make it look good.However, as great as the Transformers looked, and how much I loved them as a kid. They had just seemed to have too many unbelievable flaws. These guys are supposed to be super intelligent, uber evolved machines, yet they came off as adolescent teenagers. Their dialog was painful making me cringe at times, and left me wondering if a 10 year was playing the part of Optimus Prime. I would go into the details, but I'd rather not give away spoilers for those who have not yet seen it. It's unfortunate they didn't make a better movie.","Jul 4, 2007",6,/10

"I honestly can't think of a worse film that I've seen in some time.The plot (as was) was execrable, the dialogue astoundingly bad.The film hit self-parody before it got going (teen romantic comedy!) and didn't improve from there. I waited it out in the hope the expected climactic fight scenes might compensate, but then they were too fast and confused to make any sense - in many places it was impossible to distinguish the combatants. I'm not expecting realism in a film about transforming robots based on kids' toys, but that's not an excuse to get even the simplest basics wrong.I didn't expect much after early reviews, but I was hoping to at least see a passable check-brain-at-door action movie. *sigh* I'll know better than to see another Michael Bay movie in future.","Jul 27, 2007",1,/10

"This movie was a decent adaptation of the popular Transformers series. Now this movie certainly was strong in the effects department but the actors looked like they were struggling at times. Despite all this, they still had a strong plot overall, along with an all star cast. The movie starts off with a young Shia LeBeaouf as Sam, his goal at this point is to get an A in every class to get his first car and ultimately make it in society. Along with Megan Fox as his soon to be girlfriend. The story starts off somewhat slow, the car he buys from the dealership just happens to be Bumblebee, one of the Autobots. The story continues further as Sam eventually finds out the truth about his car and the Autobots vs Decepticons. The plot holds tight to the original series overall. The different Autobots are all forming to defeat the Decepticons and take down Megatron. I would have liked to see Hotshot instead of Bumblebee but thats my opinion. The creators really made a great interpretation and adaptation of Transformers. I had a few problems with this movie however. Number One would have to be the weight of these giant machines. Throughout the movie they seem to movie so gracefully, like their weightless. Sure one could argue that there rocket propulsion to make them seem weightless, but still it bothered me a bit which cost this movie a few points. The other problem I had was the size of the machines. In the series they were not at that large except for Optimus Prime and Megatron, their size held their significance. However in this movie they were quite large. But despite all of this it was still a decent action flick and I strongly recommend it for all the fans because its just Transformers at their best. Enormous, loud, and entertaining. If your not a fan I still recommend it. Its a great action flick that wont disappoint with its great special effects. So I give this a 70% because it appeals to the fans and pulls in some new ones as well.","Feb 13, 2011",7,/10
"It would take me as long as the running time of this disaster to point out all that was wrong with it. The first thing you will notice is that the color of every scene has been destroyed. Senor Spielbergo should take all his fancy multi-million dollar computer controlled color ruining machinery and throw it all away. Then sit down and watch something like ""North by Northwest"" and see what true, accurate color looks like. The next most nauseating thing is all the moving camera shots. I tried counting them, then gave up when I realized that 99% of the whole movie is traveling camera shots. Just a few minutes of that nonsense is enough to make you barf.Then there are the unlikable characters, which is just about everyone in this film. Totally shallow characterizations, somebody ought to tell the billionaire geniuses over at Dreamworks that if you hold a camera on an annoying and stupid jerk, like the character played by Shia LeBouef, long enough, they will appear to be annoying and stupid jerks. I could not have cared less for what happened to anyone in this ""movie"".Next is the cloying and maudlin sentimentality, the humor that wasn't funny, the shallow stereotyping, and the presumption that the US Defense establishment is always working towards the good of all mankind. Oh brother give me a break, I'm through being kind to this piece of crap, it is tied for last place as the worst movie of all time! Anyone who needs proof that a bunch of over paid moguls can and will spend millions to make something truly awful just look at this film.","Jul 18, 2008",1,/10
"Don't get me wrong, I thought this movie was entertaining. At times. But there are a lot of things wrong with it that you'll notice instantly if you stop paying attention to the explosions for two seconds. First of all, it takes place almost entirely at 5pm, with the few exceptions of a couple night scenes. The sun is always low on the horizon, beaming in light at impossibly dramatic angles. This rule goes double for the end fight. Don't forget about the well-placed slow-motion ""hero shots"". I can't tell you how many times I thought I was watching Armmageddon and that's not a good thing. Some of the ""hero shots"" are almost identical to this movie's. And having multiple slow-mo shots of your heros getting off of planes or helicopters gets old fast. The thing that really made this movie painful, however, was the script. I could handle the cheesy dialouge between the robots, but when the same crap starts shooting back and forth between the humans, there's a problem. Listen to what the people say in this movie and tell me that it even comes close to how people talk. I dare you. Still, despite all that, and many other things to be assured, I still had a good time watching this. For a summer blockbuster, its works just fine and the CGI action, while a bit over the top, is still top-notched and fun to watch. It may not be brilliant film making, but it does its job well.","Nov 12, 2007",6,/10

"transformers an average summer popcorn flick. I must admit I have never seen the show or played with any of the toys so my review is strictly about the film based on its own merits without any comparisons to other Transformer merchandise.The story is a very basic good guys vs. bad guts with the Autobots as the good guys and the Decepticons as the the bad guys. These guys had a war on their home planet over the control of a mystical cube the Allspark. Well the Allspark made it to Earth and Megatron of the Decepticons found it but he got encased in arctic ice. Well the protagonist Sam Witwicky(Shia LaBeouf) grandfather found the Megatron and on his glasses Megatron engraved the location of the Allspark. Well the Autobots come to earth to get the Allspark and protect Sam while Megatron and Decepticons try to get it.The good points of the film are the action sequences which come fast and furious, the film editing and the sound effects. The technical aspects of the film are all first rate and it looks like a big budget summer action flick.

I am disgusted that this movie was marketed to children - as evidenced by the requisite happy meal and toy tie-ins.I ended up rating this movie a 7, because it was engaging.

"""Transformers"" is a lot of fun. Despite the negative reception the future installments of the franchise would receive, this Michael Bay effort is at least entertaining. Action scenes are plentiful and satisfying and the CGI has aged quite well for the most part. Unfortunately, the human characters are either very annoying or stock cliché. Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky is always nervous, always sweating, always making excuses for himself. Megan Fox is there as the eye candy love interest and of course we have your typical military types, comedy relief types, and government agent types. Despite the long run time, the film doesn't feel like it buckles under its own weight. Too bad the Transformers don't show up until an hour in.

"The film may be nearly 18 years old, but it remains highly watchable and arguably the best in the franchise. The Witwicky family dialogue and Agent Simmons still make me laugh to the point of tears. Though the film's length means there isn't a constant stream of action (and some moments of downtime feel prolonged), the action scenes that are present pack a real punch. From the introductory action at the start, you only have to wait three minutes for the first Decepticon rampage.

"Firstly, I'd like to tell u that I'm Russian so it's difficult to me to write my thoughts in English, but I'll try. When I saw the poster of ""Transformers"" I thought:""Wow! The most favourite cartoon of my childhood is on the big screen! Nostalgia!"" I must tell u that this American cartoon couldn't been shown in USSR in 80s, so firstly it was showed in 1994, when I was 4. So this interesting colorful cartoon became very popular in Russia and I was its fun too, as many Russian children. I had every series of the cartoon, I had some toy transformers and posters of them. But I didn't know then that this cartoon would ""transform"" into full-fledged movie. Now my dream is reality. Michael Bay is very talented director so I expected something very big. Unfortunately it hasn't followed my through. Good things in the movie are firstly sound effects and video effects. They are perfect, I can't say more. The humor. I laughed during this film more than during many good comedies. Crazy small Nokia-robot is simply super. The humor makes more attractive fights and battles. Another good thing is actors especially Megan Fox. This girl is very beautiful, even only this force u to watch this movie again and again. Shia is, in my humble opinion, too simple and weak for the main role. These are all good things. But there are many bad things. For example, the script. Two crazy groups of aliens firstly are searching for the old glasses then for the strange cube. What a blather for high-quality film. It's funny but not interesting! And nearly during the half of the movie many pieces of metal are fighting and fighting and Great American Army cannot do anything! Robots have made well but they haven't their own tempers like it was in the cartoon. They are like godzillas or stupid king-kongs but not the living race. Also the movie advertise too much for example Nokia or GMC. So, my opinion is that is not a bad film, Michael Bay cannot do bad films, but I wanted more and I think old cartoon is better.","Jul 17, 2007",6,/10

"I admit, the prospect of a Transformers film filled me with ecstasy. I'm too young to have seen the G1 cartoon but I grew up on G2, Beast Wars, and any other version I could get my grubby hands on. When I heard they were making a live film and that Spielberg was involved, I was over the moon. Then I found out that Spielberg was produced and the film would be directed by Michael Bay. Oh what a sad day. Bay is a master of special effects, but he can't make a stimulating and engaging film to save his life.The plot of the film is (as I expected), thin. However, Bay does what he always does and stretches the plot as far as he can, thus making every flaw infinitely more obvious. This film could have survived with no plot at all, but instead he milks the bizarre story for way more than its worth.Another problem: too many humans. I wanted to see a movie with robots beating the bolts off one another. I got some of that, but Bay allows the military and even average schmucks to square off with these mechanical titans. Shia LeBoeuf earns my eternal respect and admiration for pushing the part of Sam far beyond its limits, but in a good way. He's charming, funny, engaging; he must have shown up on the wrong set and decided to stay. Megan Fox is hot, but she only serves to set up more laughs from Shia. These should have been the only two noteworthy humans in the film, but no. We've got two hackers, the Secretary of Defense, a small band of soldiers, and even a government agency. In a film devoted to robots, the robots only appear on screen about 20 percent of the time. As with all Bay films, it tries to convey depth with a thin romantic subplot. Cheesy romance does not equal depth. Character development and analysis equals depth. Robots have no depth (even sentient ones), so just get to the fighting.When Bay deigns to let us see the Transformers, he only looks at the Autobots. In the entire film we are allowed one snippet of Decepticon dialog where Megatron tells off Starscream. The rivalry between those two is hands down the richest and deepest part of the cartoon. How could you not go further with that? Axe the longing stares that Shia gives to Fox and you've freed up enough time to study the only intriguing subplot in the Transformers universe. But no, we instead look at the Autobots, who repeat over and over that humans must be protected. I appreciate it fellas, but I can't root for you if I can't see how evil the other guys are.There are some funny lines here (notably involving Sam's parents), and the action is just what you'd expect from a Michael Bay film: loud, explosive, and awesome. However, this film would have been a modern action masterpiece if Spielberg had directed and Bay had produced. Steven would have given the explosions purpose. He would have looked at the bad guys. Bay could still put fire and bullets all over the place, but he couldn't bore us with yet another pointless romance. It's worth seeing and if you have an HD player, it was made for this film, but it's a vacant film that could have and should have been much more entertaining.","Oct 26, 2007",6,/10

"Transformers 6 out of 10 There was a time in my life where a certain toy was my most prized possession. That toy was Optimus Prime. Aside from G.I. Joe's, Transformer's were my favorite. I would set for hours playing puppeteer to one after another autobot/decepticon battle. So, much like the hundreds of thousands of TM fan boys out there I waited to see the live action version with much anticipation. The only thing I wasn't sure about is Mr. Michael Bay being involved. After unleashing such warmed over mediocrity over the past ten years (Armageddon, Bad Boys II, etc), I had my reservations about how he would bring TM to the big screen, but surprisingly he got a lot right. Not everything though.The film starts out with an Optimius Prime voice-over setting up the struggle between good and evil then takes us straight into the life of Sam (Shia LeBeouf). Sam is just your average teen, trying to buy a new car to impress the girl. But, when his father buys him a vintage yellow Camaro, Sam doesn't realize that it is a robot in disguise. The Camaro ends up being the autobot, Bumblebee. (Bumblebee was originally a VW bug as a toy, but in an effort to totally be a whore to general motors and to make Billy Woodring enjoy this movie he was turned into the newest model Camaro) There's a great sequence when Bumblebee drives away in the middle of the night and Sam gives chase, thinking his car is being stolen, and then discovers his Camaro turning into a thirty foot tall robot. From there all the pieces start to fall perfectly in place. The rest of the Autobots are introduced. Jazz (voiced by none other than Eddie Winslow from Family Matters), Ratchet, Ironhide, and yesOptimus Prime! Optimus explains the battle between good and evil again to Sam and reveals to him that the key to saving earth lies in Sam's great grandfather's eye glasses that Sam is currently trying to pawn on eBay. (Yeah I knowjust go with it.) At this point Bay has done almost everything right. The acting is pretty much what you expect from a summer blockbuster, except for LeBeouf. Shia LeBeouf is subtly becoming the next big thing in Hollywood and I think he will have a bright future as the leading everyman. He does the best that he can with the script and turns out a great lead performance I could have done without Tyrese and Josh Duhamel's characters. I mean come on , do we really need to see Duhamel jumping off a speeding motorcycle and then sliding on his back on the street fifty feet all while double fisting machine guns at a Decepticon? Come on Bay, not everything has to be that over the top! The FX and the overall look of the film are great. The Transformers look really awesome and the CGI blend in with the real background almost flawlessly. The main problem I had with TM is the running time. There is no reason the running time needed to be two hours and thirty five minutes. My nostalgia started to sputter out around one hour and forty five minutes and I think they could have saved some face by cutting the last thirty minutes of CGI battles. Bringing back Peter Cullen to reprise the voice of Optimus was a nice touch, but I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to hear ""You got the touch"" at the closing credits. That song was from the 1986 animated feature and the song was later hilariously recreated by Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reilly in Boogie Nights. I guess that's the difference between Michael Bay and me. I would have chosen ""You got the touch"" for the closing, Michael chose Linkin Park. This is definitely an improvement on Bay's recent work though. I'm not saying its Armageddon bad and I'm not saying its Bad Boys good. I think it is somewhere right in between.So, my suggestion to you is that if you are a Transformer fan boy like me, find the biggest screen in your town and go see it with 500 other people. The robot battles will keep you entertained for two hours. If you're not a fan and you don't know even know what a decepticon is, then I hear A Mighty Heart is pretty good.JB","Jul 5, 2007",6,/10
"What happened to Hollywood? How long it'll produce such a sh*t? Don't they care, that movies like this simply betray the idea of summer blockbuster? Don't they see, movies get worse and worser. There is no plot, no acting, just CGI and nothing. Of all movies I saw this summer all were awful. Next was a garbage, Spider Man 3 was a waste, Die Hard 4 was just boring. 11 years ago I thought Emmerich's Independent Day is a sh*t, but at least there was the narrative, you could follow. Transformers, which is nothing but an useless ID rip-off, even don't have a clear storyline. And I just wonder, how soon Hollywood will make a LEGO-movie.","Jul 6, 2007",1,/10
"I do my film review of the TRANSFORMERS movie franchise and I am going to start with the first installment of the franchise, released in 2007.The film follows Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets caught up in a war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery.The Autobots intend to use the AllSpark, the object that created their robotic race, in an attempt to rebuild Cybertron and end the war while the Decepticons desire control of the AllSpark with the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth.The film was developed in 2003 and the film went into production in 2006 and it was released on July 3, 2007 and the film was really amazing when I first saw the feature film and I was impress to see the Transformers on screen and I really did not know what they were until I went online and found out more about them.The CGI and action sequences were amazing and the Autobots and the Decepticons were really created well with the help of computer-generated imagery and the final fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron is my favorite action sequence in the Transformers film released in 2007.My favorite Transformer characters are Optimus Prime, Bumbleebee, Jazz and Ratchet. Peter Cullen does the voice of Optimus Prime and he does a great job. Mark Ryan does a really great job as Bumblebee. ""Family Matters"" actor Darius McCrary plays Jazz. Robert Foxxworthy plays Ratchet and they are both amazing in their performances. Hugo Weaving from V FOR VENDETTA and THE MATRIX TRILOGY does a really great job and it is amazing to hear him as Megatron.The human characters are also great. Shia LaBeouf is really good as the lead, while Megan Fox is really hot and is amazing and she was the right choice to play the love interest of Shia LaBeouf and the two on-screen together is really amazing in this film. Tyrese Gibson is real cool. Josh Duhamel is really amazing too. Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson and Rachael Taylor plays their parts really amazing in their performances and the screen time they have.Steve Jablonsky's score is really amazing in this film and I really enjoyed Linkin Park's song, ""What I've Done"" and I loved the music video and their other two songs from the other two films, ""New Divide"" and ""Iridescent"" in Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon and the song by Imagine Dragons from Age of Extinction is called ""Battle Cry"". I liked that song, too.Overall, TRANSFORMERS is a perfect movie by all means and I am giving this a 9 out of 10.","Sep 29, 2015",9,/10

"Transformers was a decent movie if you don't think. When I say that it goes beyond just the notion that giant talking robots aren't real. We all know that, and that's not what I'm saying. This movie is meant to be enjoyed the way a roller coaster is meant to be enjoyed. You just strap yourself in and go for the ride. There's a lot of action, poorly written dialogue, and dazzling special effects. The acting is only on par with the direction. Michael Bay may know how to blow things up in amazing ways, but he lacks the ability to really get a reaction out of an actor. But, once again, this film is not meant to showcase anyone' true acting grit. It's meant to be a fun ride that everyone can easily enjoy. It's a throwback to the reason we grew up watching and loving movies. In this primal sense, it's a winner.","Jul 30, 2009",7,/10

"Hmm where do i start...well this movie really wasn't all the bad everyone was expecting it to be, yet it had moments where it could have been better. The acting was OK, Shia did a decent job as Sam though i didn't see why they couldn't have had him called ""Spike"" once or twice here and there, to make reference of them 80's show and for someone to actually know thats him he's playing as. Cause i doubt highly many people, if not any, knew Spikes real name was Sam in the cartoon series...i don't think they ever mentioned that. But anyhow, it wasn't as big a deal. Cullen rocked as Prime again, though you could sense in his voice that it was a lil deeper and edgier and not quite the 80s Cullen voice as prime but in general i think it was still a great job, despite some corny and unnecessary lines. What i really had fair beef with was the lack of characterization on the Decepticons. Thats what made them so loved and comical and very entertaining to see in the cartoon. But in this live action adaptation they were really not much different then the T-1000s from the Terminator movies....lifeless walking chaotic machines. There was no intrigue to them, you would've like to have seen At least some more dialog from StarScream who we all know was the most witty and had his very individual personality which set him apart from the rest of the Cons. But all there was was one line which he had with Megatron, that was a moment i relished in the movie and was waiting for more...but there wasn't. Speaking of Megatron, Hugo Weaving did excellent and was a great replacement for Peter Welker...i kinda understand why they decided to go with him and not Welker. My favorite parts where when he would use the same phrases as the 80's Megatron did...like Boy! and Pet! I also loved the sequence when they first introduced the Autobots and you actually see them all transforming as the camera is shifting from Primes Feet to the other Bots. That part gave me goosebumps. The voices used for the Bots were good, Ratchet was my favorite you could believe the voice that it was him. Ironhide's was OK, still wished they had used someone like Sam Elliot. Jazz was good i didn't have much problem with his voice, all in all i was satisfied with the Autobots and their voices and characterization. The ending was surprisingly good, and made me already anxious for the sequel, which i hope when they're making it give a lil more attention to the Decepticons but either way, im sure will be a great movie w/e they do. Since i gave the Animated movie a 8 out of 10 im gonna give this one a 7. So, until 2009 comes.....Roll Out!","Jun 14, 2008",6,/10

"First off I would like to say that I'm glad to see Transformers live action feature and that I'm thrilled by all the cgi and the realism it portrayed but... I kinda expected it to be more serious and with depth. Autobots turnout to be like over-sized kids who play all the time, while Desepticons were to scary (maybe that's the good point). Other thing is that there were to many characters that play important roles but haven't been developed enough and yet to many scenes that were just a cgi show offs. Megatron turned out to be twice the size of Optimus, and Bumblebee is a Camaro? O.K. I understand that Volkswagen didn't gave their permission to use Beattle, but hey, why are Autobots modeled after American cars only? Another cheap patriotism trick, or good marketing. I hope that we will see some more serious plot lines and less ""kids play"" in the sequel that will surely follow.","Aug 7, 2007",6,/10
"As much as I enjoy Michael Bay and other action films, this truly disappointed me. I work in Showcase Cinemas, and every person who went to see it told me it was 'Best Film Of The Year', '5 STARS!', 'Action Packed and Thrilling'. Whereas i must have sneezed out more interesting substances than this film. It left me bored and clock-watching for the first hour, and when they finally got round to the better bits I was yawning incessantly. The special effects were of a higher quality than most, but they could have been improved marginally. The camera-work was shaky and trembling to the point where I thought the cameraman must have been doing something else with his hands, and at points was so shaky you wouldn't be able to focus. Zooms in and out were overdone and again, shakier than a builders drill. Shia LaBeauf(?) is a good actor, and I have enjoyed his previous work/am looking forward to the future films, but the script writing was slow, predictable and wooden. His female co-star was blatantly hired for something OTHER than acting, as she was blank and emotionless throughout the film. Rating this film 3 out of ten is a good rating, as I have seen worse films, but I have seen thousands more that are much better.I have had such abuse for my opinion from people, some of which haven't even SEEN the dire film yet. And my point was proved when I ran into one of them on my way to see Evan Almightly and they agreed wholeheartedly it is a atrocious film. It is grainy and shaky, with a severe disregard to the previous cartoons and the film to such an extent that it almost appeared to be MOCKING the earlier TF work and going NER NER NEE NER NER LOOK HOW S**T WE MADE YOU. It was almost satirical and ironic in that it was just so AWFUL. I truly can't see how anyone could enjoy this. Oh, and the lubricating innuendos and the masturbation scenes? one three-year-old had a minor giggle. That was it. I mean, come on.

"I consider the Transformers movie series to be one of the greatest action franchises of all time. These two movies are so entertaining I can watch them without being board. Along with the Terminator series, and Batman movies, they aren't meant to be taken seriously, just as entertainment. Although I like them both, I think the first was a little better, after all, it had to establish what happens in the rest of the series. This movie has all the action, effects, and hot celebrities you could ask for, and I can't wait to see what else Bay has planned.

"I didn't really think much of this film when i saw it on adverts etc... but for some reason my mum and her boyfriend really wanted to see it, even though apparently i watched the TV series when i was younger.Good Points -Brilliant visual effects, the way the robots transformed was extremely realistic -the sound effects (not music), the metallic sounds really suited the robots obviously and fitted well. -The comedy, Perfectly timed and was extremely funny at times - even with the robots.Bad Points -The Soundtrack, this goes with the confused direction. One moment there was the hard instrumental almost 'patriotic American' drums that you get in some films;which really added to the films serious side. However then there was some rock in it which lightened the film slightly. Yeh some films can switch tones but it really didn't work in this. - Getting back to the directing. Usually with a film you get a gut feeling on how the film will be. This one i just couldn't decide whether it was a serious hardcore action or a child's comedy. The two didn't mix well and Michael bay really didn't do well...and the great Spielberg.I would advise watching this you could like it but it really didn't suite me the too sharp camera angles and the none fitting music just took away the experience.","Jul 22, 2007",6,/10
"Do you want your childhood raped again for financial gain as appose to being immortally honoured? Before this film came out I overheard people saying that it would be made for all those in their late twenties/early thirties who remember the original cartoons and that they couldn't possibly mess it up, could they? Well enter big budget movie maestro Michael Bay and Steven 'can I have my fingers in anymore pies' Spielberg and more CGI than your eyes can take and you have the most disappointing film of the decade. Made for thick people who are easily distracted by colours and pre-pubescent boys who will almost certainly have hard-ons at the sight of the cars, the girls and of course the robots it is two hours of CG-action and very little else. Id tell you about the plot and the story if it had either, I don't remember any of the characters names, except the bumbling Malcolm in the middle type lead Sam (played by Shia LaBeouf) and I only remembered the robots because I had the toys as a kid. Mostly the film couldn't decide if it was an action or a comedy and uncomfortably spliced the two which became a little jarring at times. Considering they are an advanced alien life forms millions of light-years ahead of humans and don't forget 'robots in disguise' a particularly cringe worthy scene is played out in Sam's garden as all five autobots turn into the metallic equivalent of the three stooges and instead of just turning into vehicles they stay as robots and try to hide in bushes, hilarity ensues when a dog wees on one and optimums prime treads on the roses with a 'whoops my bad'. Sadly there is also a couple of slightly mild racial moments like when a soldier in a battle is trying to contact the pentagon and gets through to an Asian call centre and Autobot Jazz has been remodelled as a homeboy all street and full of b-boy attitude. The continuity is appalling to say the least, one example being: soldier 'Sam run up and set off this flare on the roof', Sam 'I cant do it', soldier 'you can you're a soldier now, go' Sam 'ok', soldier on radio 'all incoming planes look for the green flare' Sam gets to the roof and sets off a red flare which to me is just plain laziness its almost like the filmmakers are going 'the idiot audience wont notice and if they do we'll already have their cash so who cares'. Of course flare colour aside I think the army might notice ten twenty foot robots scrapping without a sign and if not are they actually going to be of any use to us? Sitting through this film I felt like Malcolm McDowell's Alex from 'A Clockwork Orange' where they hold his eyelids open and making watch horrific images at breakneck speed. The inner geek in me loved the robots smashing the living crap out of each other but the inner child and outer film fan was so disappointed. Left open for sequels (I heard a rumour they have already green lit 2 & 3) they will make more films because the films sell the toys, and you can blame Mr.Lucas for that, Transformers is the final nail in the coffin of the movie blockbuster, soulless eye candy that's only goal is to fill its pockets, taking money and returning empty promises. One of the tag lines is 'some have come to destroy us' which could as easily be related to the executives behind such films, now all we need are the ones that 'will come to save us'. Basically it's a shame this film couldn't transform itself into a half decent movie because disguised in there somewhere I'm sure there is one, instead we are left with a missed opportunity of Cybertronic proportions.","Aug 9, 2007",10,/10
"So I went along last night to see this film. Incidentally, if you can get to see a DLP screening of it, do, the digital projection is awesome.So, I thought the acting was OK, the plot mediocre, but the effects beyond anything I have ever seen.However, as a kid who grew up obsessed with transformers, and would probably be able (I know, I don't need you to tell me how sad I am) to recite the lines of the 1986 movie from heart I've seen it so often, I was disappointed at the god-awful plot and this is the reason for my OK-kinda good score.There is light at the end of the tunnel however.I understand that most people going to see this movie now would not be as familiar with the transformers as I am, and so launching them into the plot of the original movie would be far too complex and confuse too many people.I have a theory, or rather a theory borne on a wish. I am hoping, taking a long view of this, that these transformers movies will end up being a trilogy, with the last movie being the re-make that I would so love to see.The best thing about this theory is that the plot and some of the dialogue is already written, you just need to update it, take out the original jokes and replace them, and (sadly - I don't want to say this) replace the 80's cock-rock soundtrack with whatever today's equivalent is, and you've got yourself one fine movie.So if it happens - you heard it here first!

This coming from someone who has seen the supposed blockbusters of 2007 like 300, Spider-man 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3, Shrek 3, and Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Transformers easily tops the lot.Micheal Bay does an excellent job bringing the 80's cartoon to the big screen. As a kid I grew up with Transformers so it's natural that I'd have some expectations for the movie, in particular with the designs of the Transformers. But Bay and his team did such an excellent job that I'm struggling to find anything to nitpick. A lot of people would argue that they should've been faithful to the original regarding the designs. These people are the hardcore Transformers fans who need to visualise how ridiculous they would look in CG. I'm glad Bay opted for a more realistic approach which works fantastically.The acting was superb. There was not a single person who could not play their part well. Shia is brilliant as Sam Witwicky and I can see him becoming a big star in the future. There were numerous hilarious scenes involving him which I won't spoil here.You must watch this movie, it will be one of the best movies of 2007 if not the movie of 2007.

"As a kid, I was obsessed with the first 3 Transformers films and used to watch them once every month. Most of my childhood favorites didn't hold up upon re-watch so let's find out if the Transformers suffers the same faithStory- 4/10The story is the weakest part of this film for many reasons. Any scene besides the action sequences was just boring and not very interesting and offered nothing special. The writing fails to make the twists or the dramatic moments reasonable. In my opinion, there was no good reason for the police to arrest Sam and many scenes didn't make sense to me which proves that the writing is on the weaker side of things. However, the story does pick up from the 3rd act and becomes interesting. Still doesn't change the fact that it was predictable though,Cinematography- 8/10For the first 80 minutes. There was no particularly exciting scene which almost made me turn the TV off. It does become intense and cinematic when the Transformers show up and the 3rd act climax was pretty well done. But because the soundtrack wasn't great, it made it slightly less exciting.Characters- 6/10Our main 2 protagonists, Sam, and Mikaela were just ok. They weren't terrible but also not fun to be around and I didn't feel the connection between Sam and Bumblebee. The Transformers didn't have much screen time but they had their quirks that made them stand out. Megatron was just an ok villain. He wasn't intimidating nor was he a terrible villain.Tones/Themes- 6/10The film's central message revolves around sacrifice, and taking risks. I couldn't pick up on the central message until Optimus Prime said it himself. The tone was the same as your average 2000's action film so yeahEnjoyability- 7.5/10Without spoiling anything, I will just bluntly say that the first half is boring, and the second half is fun. Because most of the best moments happen after the Transformers are introduced. The action in the 3rd act climax was handled pretty well. But the entire film as a whole still didn't have any funny or deep momentsOverall: 6.9/10If the writing was a little better, I would have been praising the feature. It was pretty close to being a solid, great film. If you're a fan of the Transformers and haven't checked out the feature yet, then go ahead. So does it still hold up? Maybe.","Aug 8, 2024",6,/10

"Transformers, the first installment, brought me back to my childhood right away, especially since they got the original voice for Optimus Prime, my unconditional favorite. With impeccable visuals and special effects, seeing on the big screen was an incredible experience for me.Even without watching it in theater, it's a lot of fun. It's a roller coaster thrill ride, with a punchy soundtrack of epic proportion and likable characters.Now for the bad. The dialogs are a bit too easy, it kept to its roots in that aspect. Shia Laboeuf's character can be a bit unnerving with its over-dialoging, especially in the beginning, since you haven't really had time to get to know him. The story line is unimaginative and the characters one dimensional. Finally, lots of departure from the original stories and robot design can break the mood for hardcore fans. That last was most probably to please a new generation and have all cars of American design, which is really lame.That being said, it's difficult not to enjoy this flick, if only on a superficial level. The men in the audience will certainly appreciate Megan Fox.","Dec 21, 2012",7,/10

"This film was well crafted. The Transformer purists will consistently deny this, and continue to wallow in their own disappointment, and their only refuge will be the other crying purists alongside them. So, they must realise it is impossible to take previous material, such as books, video games, TV shows, and historical events, and then place them in a modern film which effectively recreates it. Firstly, this is because a Transformers remake DOESN'T make sense. How can you fit DECADES of TV programming into a single film? I am saddened that the purists did not realise this and take it into consideration. Secondly, an exact remake brings with it complications, which must be dealt with by the producer and writers and directors, and a whole load of others that make this film possible. For example, sponsorship and usage rights come into play with makes and models of vehicles, you cannot rigidly stick to the original aspects of the show without having movie-killing complications. If for some reason you don't get the rights to have a volkswagon beetle, you either scrap, or modify. Relax. calm down, take a deep breath, and be happy that they didn't change names and they didn't make the human actors the stars of the movie. Basically if this film is looked at from the point of view of a snobby, ""this is how is must be"" Transformer purist, then you will certainly not like it. I am puzzled as to why anyone who loves Transformers enough would even go see this film, and not stick to their old recordings and tapes. To go so far as to bash one of its greatest chapters, is even more ridiculous. And to say that this film was a giant advertisement and there was ""too much slapstick comedy"" and that the plot was incomprehensible, I say to that that your ignorance is what gives you that opinion. Of course they have to specify the makes and models, and of COURSE they are going to show it. WOuld you really have been pleased if there were NO labels on anything in this film? Not any sort of connection to our world of today? only blank model cars, and blank t-shirts, and no billboards or insignias. Lets get real here guys, I found the ""ads"" for GMC to be quite subtle amongst the explosions and shapeshifting battles. If you were all strung up because of your problem with the ""Ads"" then please, stress some more, it will do a lot of good. The humour that was implanted in this movie was also subtle, whether it was because of it being once again being drowned out by the intense action sequences, or because realistically, the humour had a well founded basis. For example, A certain transformer ""pees"" on a human. Has not that certain bot been living among humans and learnt their language and ways? and in a lot of ways, these bots are quite human like. If i was 40 feet tall, and there was someone 6 feet tall i didn't like, but didn't feel like killing, and i wanted to humiliate them whilst having fun... i would personally do the exact same thing as the bot did. As for the ""teen"" feel of some of the humour, get over it, if this movie was nonstop action and explosions without a little bit of awkward conversation between then parents and the son, really, it would have been a lesser movie. Plotwise, this movie was not the most amazing thing, but it was simple, direct, and not confusing. Of course, it is a little bit out of the acceptable materials list for the Purists, but hey, why not something sort of new thrown in with the old? All in all, I loved this movie, and I can see why the purists and pretend-purists have their pessimistic opinions, because this is not an exact transcription of the original TV series. It is a great film which when considered with an open mind, is not overpowered by any certain aspect. I left the theatre excited and wide awake. I was extremely pleased. As i said before, if you truly love the old Transformers, do yourself a favor and do not see this movie, for you will be disappointed. It would be a great mistake to claim that this replaces the old series, and that this is the better. Moreover, I would consider this a great success in the Transformer history, and an addition which can be appreciated by almost everyone. I see now that many people have picked and scratched at themselves to find as many flaws in this film and list them off... but why not consider the amazing aspects of this film as well? The flawless interaction between real-life and CGI in this film is extraordinary. This is a benchmark in the world of animation. Consider the time and effort and imagination that the animators had to put in to make such beautiful images. (consider the cartoon transformations they had to go on...) Take a minute now, breathe some more, and and please consider what i have said. This is not a remake, this is a chapter; this is not a horrible film; it is beautiful; this is not fact; it is my opinion. having said this, i will once again ask the purists to calm down, and finish this off with re-iterating the fact that this movie blew my mind, and I highly recommend you see it.","Jul 8, 2007",10,/10
"I saw this movie opening weekend and at the time was mildly anticipating it. I knew Michael Bay from Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and Bad Boys so I knew what to expect; I knew Bay's style. But, I gotta say, he outdid himself this time. He put on a min blowing show full of explosive, fast paced action, eye candy, and unbeatable effects work. This is an Empire State building of movie making madness.Now, this could have been utterly ruined with the one-liners and over reliance on baseless action sequences. But there was a nice overall rhythm and flow. It slowed down enough at parts just to give me a breather and then threw me right back on the roller coaster. Each robot had distinct personalties, there were extravagant locations. Bay could have made this a corny kids movie but it worked for me big time.","May 14, 2010",7,/10
"Despite the fact that, in my opinion, Michael Bay has directed two of the worst films of all time (that would be Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys II) I knew, from the beginning that his glossy, high-key style of film-making would be PERFECT for a live-action Transformers movie. Since The Rock in 1996, all of Bay's films have been 2-hour plus epics and that is surely the kind of treatment that a Transformers movie deserves. No 90-minute piece of crap here.I was a fan of the animated show and toys as a kid, but viewing them now I can see how clumsy, poorly animated and just plain impractical it was. There was no reason for it to exist other than to market toys, which is fine when your five-years-old, I guess. Despite the family-friendly rating, the showing I went to had absolutely ZERO kids in the audience as it was mainly made up of twenty-somethings who had watched the show in their childhood and who would appreciate it better.Well, where to begin about how good it is. I regard this as an 'Event' movie way more than endless, tiresome Spider-Man and Shrek sequels. The Transformers movie was anticipated for a long, long time and only in the past few years has the technology to realize the giant, alien robots on film been advanced enough. The Transformers are so photo-realistic that I'm beginning to suspect that they actually exist and are being kept secret by Sector 7. This film will SURELY win the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects next year. Nothing can rival this.The story (written by the team that wrote the Goonies II video game, would you believe) and characters are rather medium-sliced. Nothing superficial yet nothing heavy enough to slow the film down. The Transformers mythology has been altered somewhat from the TV series but only to tie-up loose ends and plot holes and to give it a more contemporary feel. If you were really cynical you say that it's just a big chase movie, but so many plot threads building at once there's enough complexity to keep most cynics quiet.Shia LeBouf (who seems to be Hollywood's biggest young star right now) plays Sam Witwicky, a nerdy high-schooler with dreams of being a popular ladies man. His dad buys him a mysterious, banged-up yellow Camaro for getting good grades but the car seems to have a mind of it's own. Of course it does-it's Bumblebee and he's been sent to Earth to protect Sam from the Decepticon's who want an old artifact of Sam's that belonged to his great-grandfather, an explorer who discovered the long, long frozen Megatron in an underground Arctic cave.Over the course of his adventures Sam encounters a showcase of actors including Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro, Bernie Mac and, eventually Optimus Prime, who is a star in his own right. All of these actors try to run away with the film, which helps since the characters, like I said, are not densely written so their energetic performances make up for this. Though Megan Fox looks a bit older than her years and has an unlikeable 'attitude'. Did she really have a good reason to be knitting her eyebrows like that for the whole film or is she just posing for the camera?My only other complaint is that Steve Jablonsky's dull score is basically a carbon-copy of Klaus Badelt's score for Poseidon. Both men are protégé's of Hans Zimmer I believe and their imaginations have so far proved to be rather meagre for every film they have scored. Transformers reminded me a lot of ID4. Now how cool was David Arnold's score for that? Steve Jablonsky could have really made something out of this but instead he just goes for dull synthy sounds and jarring sound effects. Yeesh! Transformers is definitely an epic, must-see movie and is surely bursting at the seams with amazing set-pieces and breathtaking action. I impatiently await a sequel and look forward to owning it in glorious HD. The best film of the summer, no doubt.","Jul 28, 2007",9,/10

"Man, I gotta tell you, the CGI effects are crazy, people were clapping!!! And the plot/audio/other VFX were perfectly done. I liked the humor, it was very funny. Bay did a great job of mixing G1 with newer characters, and those robots actually look REAL. I mean if you would see a transformer, thats what it would look like. I'm not really a huge fan of the transformers, but this movie made me love it!!!... this is definitely worth the 7 bucks people.The storyline is perfect with a beautiful ending... it is also left open for a sequel, which according to the writers will happen, and all the actors got signed for Dreamworks for 2 movies, so the question is not IS? but WHEN? I don't wanna give away much, go see it you will NOT be disappointed I promise you that. Ohh and P.S. to all the fans on this board that are dragging' about the small details like the characters, Megatron not turning into a gun, shut it, because I saw the movie in a screening room FULL of fans and everyone loved it saying it was the best *LIVE ACTION* (don't forget that) adaptation ever!!!

"This is my review on transformers a modern take on an old animated show. It stars Shia Labouef and Megan Fox and was directed Michael Bay.This movie is about a boy named sam (Shia) who is kind of a nerd some what of an outcast. Who has a crush on a girl (Fox) and then one day his dad buys him a car and it turns out to be much more then that.I found this movie to be alright, Shia did a solid acting job but as for Fox everyone knows she cant act and this movie was no exception though she did look good which is why she was there. I found this movie to be a bit long for its plot. I found it dragged out when it could have ended much quicker.Overall I think this movie is worth watching but don't expect too much. 6/10","Jun 28, 2011",6,/10
"I was a massive Transformers fan when I was a kid, and I've been waiting for a big budget adaptation ever since I saw Jurassic Park and realised it could be possible. I watched the film last night, and I was glad to see that Bumblebee, one of the integral characters, was yellow. Unfortunately everything else (with the exception of a couple of randomly used names) had changed.The story was overly simplistic, ugly, and made no sense, and the Transformers were overly complicated, ugly, and made no sense.The robots all look the same, and there was no character development, which is a pity because it was the individuality of the characters that made the original concept so enjoyable. The design of the robots themselves bore no relation to the much loved look of the originals. One robot, who I think was meant to be Frenzy, looked more like some kind of stainless steel multiple egg whisking contraption than the stocky humanoid warrior of yore. There was also some kind of giant scorpion robot that I don't think was ever properly explained. Megatron, the iconic bucket headed leader of the Decepticons is now an indistinguishable metal mess.There are so many human characters in this film that I think they're each given approximately 30 seconds of screen time to tell their stories. The soldiers? Pointless. The computer geeks? Unnecessary. The Secretary of Defence? Waste of a good actor. A terrible film. Could've been good. But then, so could've Pearl Harbour.","Jul 29, 2007",1,/10
"It's literally a CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) epic .. the tiniest bits of parts to the most gigantic structural bodies stand out as an amazing piece of work, of modeling, texturing, Rigging and finally the Animaton.. this movie started a long line up of movies following it . Though the scene to scene cut play should be dealt with in a better way rather than showing that it's in a hurry about something . So that the film could have a steady pace rather than people jumping and going crazy in every scene .. and looking like they're in some kind of hurry .. etc . The intensity of every scene is more than required, but it still stands out as a winner.","May 20, 2021",8,/10
"During many points of this film, I found myself sitting there shaking my head in disbelief that I was watching it. A lot of the plot elements (especially where the government is involved) seem ridiculous and unbelievable, even for a movie about giant robots. The robots themselves looked very cool and realistic, though I sometimes missed the cleaner designs of their animated counterparts. I find it a bit odd that the filmmakers would go to such trouble to make the robots look real, and place them into such epic battle scenes, yet try so hard not to take things too seriously. It might've been more effective had they gone for straight drama. I wasn't even trying to compare this to the animated _Transformers: The Movie_, however, until this film lifted a quote directly from its predecessor. If they're gonna invite the comparison, they should at least make sure they measure up well. I would probably buy this when it comes out on DVD just 'cause the visuals are so cool, but I definitely feel the animated version was better and will continue to hold up better over time.","Jul 9, 2007",6,/10
"I knew that Transformers would be trite and hammy, that's OK. What I didn't know is that it would be an embarrassing caricature of everything bad we've come to expect from a Michael Bay film. I was ready to walk out after about 30 minutes because it became abundantly clear that the story wouldn't build up any steam until the last possible moment. Sure enough, the movie doesn't get on with business until the 90 minute mark.The unsteady pacing reminded me of Jurassic Park. There's a dumb MacGuffin (in this case, a powerful cube) that keeps everybody stumbling around, slack jawed. Every 15 minutes or so a set brief piece jumps out of the bushes to shock the audience, then things shift back into 1st gear.It's a frustrating movie to watch. The robots are amazing, but they barely have screen time that doesn't involve them fighting or pussy-footing around whatever the humans are up to. We never really care about what motivates the Autobots, because they don't share it with us. They just jump from one crisis to the next, all the while trying to go undetected like Mr. Snuffalopogus. Nothing ever makes a lick of sense, the action is impossible to follow, and after a while you just give up and stare blankly while people and robots scramble around trying to accomplish seemingly arbitrary tasks that change from minute to minute.If this movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Starship Troopers, Basic Instinct) we would have had delightfully one-dimensional charters taking a back seat to robots kicking the crap out of each other. Instead we get Michael Bay's melodramatic ""Sweet Valley High Marine Corps"" vision of the world which attempts to cheaply pull on our heartstrings at every given opportunity wile at the same time cramming in jillions of set pieces featuring exploding explosions and non sequiturs that can be explained away by jerky camera work.With the amazing production design you'd think that it would have been easy to make Transformers into good popcorn fun. Instead it fees like work. The set pieces are clumsy, and never build to a point where we feel any sense of danger or tension. If a good action movie is football, Transformers is flag football.","Jul 5, 2007",3,/10
"This movie is crazy-in a good way though. I have never in my life seen Transformers the series or Transformers:the movie. I have never even seen or heard about the toys but it turned out to be an outstanding movie. All I have to say is... I underestimated this movie but it definitely surprised me. Only 3 words-SEE THIS MOVIE. It will be worth your while. I'm almost sure everyone will agree. Transformers surprised me because I thought ""Oh great another cheesy toy movie."" But I got talked into going to watch it, I went, and was amazed.Anyone will enjoy. It's a family movie, and there's a lot of good action. It also has a great plot with great acting.","Jul 7, 2007",10,/10

"This movie was utterly stunning. The special effects were greatly composed to blend in with the real actors, and you could barely tell the difference. It was a nonstop action flick that left your heart still beating after you left the theater. This movie has officially moved to my favorite movie list, and I've only seen it once. Even if you've never watched the TV show, you will have no trouble watching this movie. It is kid appropriate (the only non kid parts are somewhat scary or when people die at the hand of the Decepticon)], but it is also an exciting adult movie. It had it's humor in the movie, making it a laugh-out-loud flick, before changing into the exciting fight scenes. I thought that it was a lot better than Spiderman 3, and a lot more exciting than Pirates of the Carrabein 3. (too long and predictable) I definitely believe that it was the best movie of the season, and probably the year. If you liked movies like IRON MAN (cartoon) or FAST AND FURIOUS or any sort of earth threatening movie where the human race is in the hands of one or two people, than you'll LOVE this movie. I give my humblest regards to the producers, and *hIgHlEy* recommend it.","Jul 5, 2007",10,/10

"I went into this movie with expectations restrained. The trailers kicked @ss, but then again thats the purpose of trailers, right? They're little bundles of lies that leads us to believe a movie will rock the sh*t, whether they do or not we soon discover once we sit through the features themselves. Fortunately no lies were involved here, and, if anything, the movie itself tore the trailer to bits and p*ssed on each shard one fragment at a time.It was an arresting experience, sitting in awe, watching this movie roll by one frame at a time. I was just engrossed. It was one of those instances where you're so overwhelmingly entertained that you begin to forget you're sitting in a cinema full of people; you're by yourself in your own mind, you're locked-in, and your existing for every moment of the film that passes by. I know that in itself seem like a very powerful statement to make, I mean, it's not like this film bears the same kind of emotional integrity as say Schindler's List or Hotel Rwanda, but that doesn't make it any less an experience to savour. It has the kind of energy and enthusiasm that we all embodied as tiny children when we were crunching our Transformer figures together on our bedroom floors; occasionally integrating a Ninja Turtle, or a Ghostbuster just to broaden the fantasy in our tiny minds.If you go into this film as a critic, you'll be doing yourself a disservice. This film demands that you volunteer your senses. That you don't sit there in analytical mode; questioning why every ounce of the film is happening the way it's happening and why. You can do that with all the Bergmann, Lynch, and Ozu films you want to when you get home. And if you simply insist on doing that then you've chosen the wrong film. Transformers is an artifact; an anonymous exhibit in a museum with no factoid printed below it. You don't need to know how or why it got here, you just need to look and admire.","Jul 23, 2007",9,/10
"I was ready to switch my brain off walking into the theatre, especially when it comes to Michael Bay. But what bothered me were the obvious pro-Iraq war messages being delivered front and centre. A lot of current events involving world affairs play a part in the story. Why? This is a dumb movie based on a kids toy. That's what's disturbing. The pro-Military message: ""We are in for the long fight"", (like Bush's perpetual War Against Terror) is being drilled directly into young teenagers heads. For the sake of the Transformers legend (Good robots battle Bad robots over Energy Cube) there isn't much need to bring Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Bush, and Rumsfeld (played by Jon Voight). Worse, there is the heavy line at the pinnacle of the movie, where our hero says ""No Sacrifice, No Victory"". Pick up your Army brochures in the lobby. The film gets off to a disturbing start, with an all too familiar site of US soldiers (and civilians) fighting and dying in the middle east. What is this scene doing in a kids Transformer movie? There are also jabs at outsourcing in India, immigrants speaking Spanish, and clichés about African-Americans. Technically, there was too much reliance on CGI to wow you at the end. Unfortunately, Michael Bay's patented moving camera shots left me feeling a little dizzy, and mostly unable to get a good angle on the robot fights. Seriously, when you cut from a tracking shot straight to another tracking shot, you need to be able to get your bearings. But no, you cut away too quickly for anything to register. This carries on at the end for way too long. There are really so many wow shots one can handle in succession to have any real appreciation for the peril that anyone might be in. It is really too bad this all falls apart in the third act, because I could feel the Spielberg influence in Shia LaBeouf's character, and could dig the Boy and his Car subtext. I also applaud the over-the-top attitude about how the robots behave. This is the first American movie that has really embraced the kooky Japanese MechaGodzilla type of nonsense. This comes complete with a clueless military, two kids that always hold the key to everything, and kid-friendly heroes. Michael Bay has no idea how to make a proper film, having directed 1000's of TV commercials. At least there was some decent story elements that entertained me most of the time. But Bay will never get any legitimate credibility as long as he literally has no ideas beyond - keep the camera moving.","Jul 5, 2007",6,/10
"This movie has been the most enjoyable movie of the year for me. I'm a fan of Transformers, but this movie is good for non-fans as well. It's not a Kurosawa or Scorsese movie, nor will it win best picture. But unlike a lot of movies, it's entertaining, surprisingly smart, and has memorable characters, and a better sense of comedy than most 'comedies'. As for the special effects, a lot has already been said about them, so I won't waste time praising them. What delighted me the most about this film was how the characters were treated as characters, not flashy effects, particularly Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. Probably the only complaint I have is the lack of dialog from most of the Decepticons. But then again considering the fact that they are war machines and have a shoot first and ask questions later policy, that can be somewhat forgiven given how the story developed. Hugo Weaving made a really menacing Megatron for the film, Bumblebee made my Ford-devoted girlfriend grow a soft spot for Camaros. The real icing on the cake for the film however is Peter Cullen returning to voice Optimus Prime for the first time since the original series. You can tell by his vocal performance that he was happy to be voicing the character again, and not just doing it for the money. I've seen this film 3 times in the first 3 weeks of release, and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD later this year. Far and away better than Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, this film deserves to be the king of Summer 2007.","Jul 23, 2007",5,/10

It has aged horribly, the casting is awful, these people dont look like the role theyre playing at all. It gets really corny and cheesy a lot of the time.The most redeeming part really is that the cgi (for the most part) holds up well. It's a very technically impressive movie, this kind of detail, realism, and grit is not often seen anymore in modern cgi.","Aug 21, 2022",3,/10
"My husband and I saw this movie with our three sons who grew up with Transformers on TV and owned many of the toys. We were all very pleased. When Optimus Prime transformed, it was like seeing an old friend again after many years. The special effects were outstanding, the updates to current times were appropriate, and the actors met the challenge very nicely. The cooperation of the military certainly gave this movie a measure of authenticity and that wonderful credibility that sucks you right into the story. The scenes with the parents dragged some and were corny, but the Autobots were as great as ever and the Deceptions were as despicable as ever. It's going to be a tough act to follow. I hope the sequel won't be a disappointment.","Jul 5, 2007",10,/10
"I went into this with really high expectations and for the most part I'm satisfied with my choice to go. However there were SOOOO many really needless tacky humor scenes. I mean yea we get it, there's a hot girl with a body and Shia wants to do her... but they spend a good 15 minutes in the movie emphasizing that. Or the scene when the robots are hiding out at Shia's house (not a spoiler it was in the previews) it was drawn out far too long. The action scenes on the other hand were very impressive, even the bits where humans were fighting the machines. (Though the machine on machine battles were freaking awesome)Casting was good in my opinion and the voices for the robots was good, specially Optimus Prime, it was a very 'demanding of presence' voice. Overall I would recommend this to all ages for a fun Friday night flick, the action is worth it.","Jul 4, 2007",7,/10

"Being familiar with the original cartoon series of the 1980s, I was interested in catching the Hollywood live action blockbuster version. Basically, this turns out to be a combination of THE TERMINATOR (1984), INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996) and even BLACK HAWK DOWN (2001). As was to be expected for a modern day popcorn flick, teenagers are involved but, luckily, the two leads (despite their anonymity to the undersigned) were unusually affectingalthough, in the second half of the show, they too are eventually sidetracked by all the spectacle.Surprisingly enough, the villainous Decepticons are severely underused and their leader Megatron himself doesn't appear until the last half-hour or so! In fact, the most notable of the evil machines is a new addition to the fold – a hacker robot who grunts and gesticulates like a Gremlin! Also unexpected is the film's comic highlight set in the hero's backyard which sees the benign Autobots attempting to hide from the latter's overly inquisitive parents.For all the spectacular CGI-infested action sequences, the look of the machines themselves is rather cluttered – would we have been as impressed with the original King Kong if we couldn't see the mechanism at work? – and the fast and furious pace of the action sequences becomes numbing after a while: imagine the chariot race in BEN-HUR (1959) where the crucial antagonism between him and Messala is all but lost in the shuffle! Also, aren't we all tired by now to see every disaster to hit the planet nowadays being given the paranoid 9/11 spin – with the resulting affirmation of the ingenuity and superiority of the U.S. Defense system (even if they require the services of the world's top teenage hackers to crack the alien code)? Anyway, this is not a film to break down and analyze but one to take your breath away with awesome special effects and, in this regards, it succeeds well enough; for what it's worth, the human cast, apart from the afore-mentioned teenage leads, includes Jon Voight as the Secretary of Defence and John Turturro as an oddball member of a mysterious government agency.","Sep 6, 2007",7,/10

"This is the worst movie I have seen since ""Van Helsing"". Can someone please explain to Michael Bay that it's perfectly OK to have a camera shot last more than a quarter second? He is obviously trying to hide a lack of a decent plot with unbelievably kinetic, frantic, hyperactive camera work and the loudest sound/foley mix in the history of cinema. Yes, the effects are great, but frankly, if you've seen the preview or even a commercial for this movie, then you've seen the best part. This movie was a waste of however many millions of dollars it took to make it, a waste of a decent young actor (Shia Labeouf), a waste of decent special effects and the fact that the greatest film-maker of all time (Spielberg - NOT Michael Bay) is attached to this film in any way is a tragedy.

"Right its time to tell the truth. transformers really reminds me of something lets think oh yeah thats right, power rangers. i could have watched that for thirty minutes if i wanted to watch ridiculous robot fighting and stupid Americans. this film to sum up, showed predictable fighting, ridiculous acting, the use of Megan fox as eye candy and that alone and just further re iterated the point that the masses nowadays are happy to watch this tripe. national treasure is thousands of times better than this film. even forgetting the utter lack of any realism about this film, it was still a let down, power rangers showed us fighting robots and i don't see whats changed so much since then, everyone bangs on about special effects yet where are they. lord of the rings had special effects yet it was the quality of acting and the brilliance of the script which captured the audience, the special effects are simply that, effects, they don't make a film, they effect it slightly. now seriously stop praising this film and lower its rating soon.","Jan 3, 2008",1,/10
"I attended the midnight screening in Dunedin, New Zealand, this morning and oh my god, it was the best movie I have ever seen. I too am a die-hard Transformers fan(girl!), as is my brother who went with me, and it exceeded our expectations. Of course there are going to be those who think that the exact plot of the 80's cartoon should have been adhered to but come on, reality anyone? (Although, don't get me started on the X-Men movies, being an avid collector of said comics) Plus it was aimed at those of us who grew up with the cartoon, and who have grown up into more sceptical adults. I thought it was completely believable and suited to the modern times we live in, it was funny, thoughtful, action-packed and even though I had been awake for nearly a day, I was wide-eyed throughout it. Who cares that they don't match the vehicles/whatever they were in the 'day'? Or that the voices weren't exactly the same (well, then again, if Peter Cullen wasn't Optimus Prime's voice, perhaps I might I felt differently)? It was fun, it was awesome and Optimus Prime rocked. Megatron's voice was way awesomer than the original and I loved how they incorporated all the kitch-ness of the 80's cartoon into the dialogue - 'more than meets the eye' - so cool! The plot line wove neatly together, with several different characters and aspects merging towards the end, and the battle scenes were intense and the special effects amazing. I think I have waited my entire life to see something like this. Shia Lebouf was really good as Sam Witwicky and blended so well with the action. Of course he was the hero, even in the cartoons, Optimus Prime valued human life over his own. I recommend this movie to everyone (well, not the littlies), girls and boys, it so rocked my world and I am going to go see it again next week. -H","Jun 27, 2007",10,/10
"It seems Transformers splits viewers firmly down the middle, with people either denouncing it as a lot of crap or saying they loved it. I do not denounce people because they have an opinion, not unless they want to tell me I am diseased and incapable because I was born different to the expected norm anyway, but this... film... goes beyond the limit of bad writing. Hence, when a defender of this film tells me that the sky is blue, I will ask someone else for their opinion. You see, I was a hyperlexic child in 1986 (that means I had a wider vocabulary when I was in elementary school than most people have when they enter tertiary education). Hence, I not only enjoyed The Transformers, the real Transformers, I could have explained to you in very lucid terms why the physics of their abilities are not only impossible but, in light of feasibility on a planet that is not blessed with a literally infinite power source, completely ridiculous. Why do I say all that? It is very simple. This film does not just insult my intelligence, it assumes that I am like my onetime elementary school teachers and have none.Like all the truly bad films, there are moments when you start to just care about some of the characters. The soldiers who first meet one of the titular robots are likable, genuinely interesting guys. The teenagers that the film spends the majority of its time following, on the other hand, are the most insipid and annoying pieces of human filth it has been my displeasure to watch. In contrast to the Spike, Chip, or Sparkplug that gave the audience an element to relate to in the real Transformers, the Sam, Mikaela, and Maggie that pollute this abortion of an adaptation slow down the interest factor to a halt. It is one thing to make a film about a war between disparate factions of intelligent robots uninteresting. It is another altogether to make the human factor so monotonous and cliché that even the moments of interaction between people are boring. The ""oh my god I do not know how to talk to another human being because it is feminine"" act is so 1950s, guys.Adding to the misery are the action sequences. Yes, the parts of the film that are meant to give relief from the monotony of the dialogue or the who-cares tepidness of the human characters actually bring the most pain. This is because director Michael Bay, like all directors who do not know how to make an action film interesting when all else has failed, resorts to the tried and tired method of making sure the audience cannot see what the hell is going on. Michael Bay, if you are out there and can read this, I promise you that if we ever meet, I am going to make you feel as dazed and nauseous as your piece of crap film has made me. I will sign a contract to do so in blood if you want commitment. Bay should really have trusted his original instinct, as he has made nothing more than a stupid toy film. Put simply, I did not just hate this film. I turned it off feeling like Bay had just shaken his ding-dong at me for two hours.And what of the characters we were bracing ourselves to see on film? Well, Bumblebee is the one we get to see first, so let us deal with him. Put simply, Bumblebee's function in the real Transformers was to demonstrate that size alone does not make a person worthy. In spite of being not much bigger than your average Human, he often steered his fellow Autobots out of danger when it was really needed. Or rescued the human element. Take your pick. But in Michael Bay's conception of the world, everyone who is worth anything is at least 6'7"" and weighs 250 pounds, minimum. Do not try telling him Albert Einstein was a mere 5'9"", it will fall on deaf ears. And it gets worse from there. The real Optimus Prime was a leader because of several things. One, he was as intelligent as he was large (that's right, Michael, intelligence counts for A LOT in battle). Two, he was unafraid to serve the greater good, even if it came at the cost of his own life. Three, he led by example. Four, he led by example. Five, he led by example. Six, well, you get the idea.When you add all these things together, you find they contradict the very nature of the robots Michael Bay presents to us and asks us to believe are the Transformers. Optimus Prime in this film cannot even take one of his human wards to retrieve a vital element of their mission without crushing major backyard ornaments and, along with his fellow Autobots, making enough noise to alert an entire city block to their presence. Oh, and by the way, Jazz had class. He was not a twenty foot tall expression of bling-bling culture. Ugh, being that I could read Tolkien when Darius McCrary was probably failing elementary school English, his presence in this film is an insult to everything the original series was about. It is one thing to have characters who are, to quote George Clooney, dumber than a bag of hammers. This film goes a lot further This film assumes that its audience is made up entirely of four year olds who have never read a cereal packet. In so doing, it takes everything that such writers as Dennis O'Neil and Bob Budiansky created and perverts it.Transformers as directed by Michael Bay is a two out of ten film in every sense. Avoid.","Oct 31, 2007",2,/10
"Seeing my childhood fantasy played out in the big screen is just fantastic, I cannot describe how great this movie that Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg had made. To be honest, I was among millions of Transformer fanboys horrified by the idea of Bay directing Transformers and turn it into another one of his sappy, soppy, emo-action flicks but this has to be his best movie ever. Even better than The Rock! A lot of people have said bad things about Shia, but I think Shia really carried this film, he's acting is the best out of all the human actors in the movie. As for the robots voice, Peter Cullen IS GOD!!! Optimus Prime... And Hugo Weaving's mechanilised voice as Megatron is pure evil! Absolutely good job all round! And this movie received a standing ovation like you've never heard! No one in Malaysia ever clap for a movie after it ends...and in all my life of watching movies in Malaysia, this movie is the very first time I heard where people stood up and clap! This movie is really so damn good!","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"I have eclectic movie tastes. My favorite movies include E.T., Some Like it Hot, Casablanca, L.A. Confidential, and You Can Count on Me as well as Amazon Women on the Moon, Grandma's Boy, There's Something About Mary and Beerfest. My summary is a lie, it is an exaggeration. But this is one great movie. People will probably knock and be contrarian and say it's bad just to be different. They will be lying or have no clue about good movies.I was a big fan of the show when I was a kid. I know of someone who cried when Optimus died in the 1984 cartoon. Even though certain things have been changed (Bumblebee is a Camaro), they have been updated well and in sync with the original show.I've seen some reviews that say there is no story. I do not know what movie they thought they saw, but they are wrong. It has great action, a poignant (yes, poignant) story, smart acting, excellent effects, and (at times) laugh-out-loud humor.If you liked the original show, you will love it. If you are unfamiliar, you will be blown away by the action and still get most of the humor. One of the best movies I have ever seen.","Jul 2, 2007",10,/10
"Yeah, I grew up with the Transformers. Optimus was my father figure. I had a ridiculous amount of money invested in these robots. I woke up at 6am to watch the half hour show. I cried when Optimus died. Many of you born between 73 and 80 know exactly what I mean.I went in to the theater expecting everything and nothing.And I had a stupid 10-year-old's grin on my face for at least 3 hours. . . from the beginning speech by Optimus, through the movie, and imagining every car I saw on the road turning into a giant alien robot.See, it isn't that Tranformers is theatrical genius. The plot is limited, the actors are stereotyped (albeit HOT in some cases) and it is a two hour + advertisement for the military and GM.But what it is is this. . . the best action movie ever, with the most amazing effects I have ever seen. (Yeah, it beats the Matrix. You know why? It has FREAKING TRANSFORMERS in it! DUH!) It is also this, if you were born in the above said years. . . . An emotional masterpiece. Although they look different, Optimus is still Optimus, Megatron still the big bad guy and even Bumblebee as a different car still feels like Bumblebee. And if you loved these characters you will love them in this movie.","Jul 8, 2007",10,/10
"Since Michael Bay got 60 million to make the first film and screw it up on every conceivable level, I say someone starts a website that the fans of the Transformers brand can donate money to. The goal, to raise 60 million to pay Michael Bay NOT to make the sequel. I was elated to hear of his posting saying he would not direct the sequel in regards to the paramount buy out for HD exclusivity over blue ray. Now he's reneged on his promise, and now is saying we will direct the sequel. I think this franchise needs a reboot like Hulk for too many to list reasons. I'm not aware of any review that's positive if you take out any mention of the effects. Still use ILM, but for the love of God, get a director that can handle the acting, plot, pacing etc. You'll still get you're giant robots from ILM, you'll just get a story to go along with it, if we can get another director attached.","Aug 26, 2007",1,/10
"Even if you are not a Transformers fan from the early 80's and 90's, you will enjoy this thrill ride. The story line is great because you don't have to know the history of the Transformers to watch it. If you know the history of Transformers, the movie brings it to life on the big screen (and not in the cartoon fashion like the Transformers - The Movie from the mid 80's). This movie really will appeal to all ages. Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks team gets it right!!! You will believe that robots are in disguise. The special effects are amazing. Michael Bay with his need for BIG special effects gives it to you in spades and it goes hand in hand with the story line. I had some questions regarding the actors casted for their roles, but they worked out really well. I will go to see this again in the theaters again and again. I can only hope that the following two movies will stay as fresh as the first one and not go down the highway of other trilogies. Optimus Prime RULES!","Jul 8, 2007",10,/10

Never really expected it to turn out really great like this.This movie really suited for everybody. And of course, as usual, it's a must for a transformer maniacs.A definite-must-see movie.

"My review Saw the film yesterday in Australia, have to say, it is definitely one of the best films this year, 8 out of 10. I found this film to be a great science fiction/comic book movie, I can safely say it is much more entertaining than any of the previous blockbusters that have come out this year such as Spider-man 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 and Shrek 3 but I felt it still lacked things other people are going to agree with.So here's my quick rundown: The good: ·The films story telling is amazing, you never once feel like the story is dragging on, or boring, it really keeps you entertained and satisfied.·The acting is terrific by some, I absolutely enjoyed listening to some of the funniest calls made by some of the human characters, Shia definitely steals the film with his wit and humour and never leaves you unsatisfied. I found Megan Fox as hot as ever and was quite a good actress, though her acting began to decline towards the climax of the film and I didn't find it too convincing, she pulls a Jessica Alba in one scene.·The Autobot's were fantastic to watch, they absolutely kill in this film, and they were entertaining to watch when the fights broke out with the Decepticon's. I thought they were incredible and really well designed.·The Decepticon's in my opinion stole the film, they were more entertaining and had a better story to bring to the film, and I felt they were the highlight of the film.·Hugo Weaving was superb as Megatron, you will not even recognize him, it took me a while to realize it was him and I felt he did the best job voicing his character over everyone else.·The special effects were awesome; it was great watching the transformations and fights. The detail was really good and the destruction caused by the transformers looked so incredible, that it was hard to believe they pulled all of it off with CGI.The Bad: ·The dialog for the transformers was in my opinion very bad, it was too immature and it felt like Tim Story from Fantastic Four 2 came along and wrote them up himself. It felt to me that the Autobot's were mildly retarded, whether this was intentional to show how their translation from Cybertronian to English isn't very good, to make it more realistic or the writers were just bad at writing dialog and weren't sure how the Autobots would talk to one another.·The Decepticon's were much better in dialog, which doesn't say much, they showed more maturity in their dialog and were easily taken more seriously, sad enough as I was cheering for the autobot's the whole time and expected them to be the more serious of the two races.·Only three of the Decepticon's ever really speak; Megatron, Starscream and Barricade have actual dialog, the rest speak in Cybertronian in one scene of the film, and Frenzy swears quite a bit which I actually found amusing.·The most under used Autobot had to be Jazz, he makes little appearances and I wasn't pleased with him one bit being a fan of the character in the cartoon series. He only speaks 3 or 4 times in the film, but had the most mature dialog out of the Autobots showing the most compassion to his follow Autobots.·Brawl is the most underused Decepticon, he only says one thing, and appears twice in the film and that's about it for him, you will barely notice he was even there the whole time.·Frenzy had to be the weirdest transformer, some of the scenes he's in left me saying to myself wtf, as he does some awkward things when hacking through computers.·Certain scenes with the transformers were hard to intemperate; so much detail made it hard for me to understand what was happening and what the Autobot's were doing in the fight scenes.·A lot of the action is rushed and frustrating to follow and was quickly done so it was kind of like Ghost Rider for some scenes, which left them pointless.·Hardly any references to G1, I only counted about 3, so many of you who expected it to have good references, I'm afraid it doesn't.Over all, don't take my criticism to heart, it is nothing compared to the good in the film. I recommend seeing this film; it is worth seeing and really enjoying! It has become one of my favourite films of all times and I can't wait to see it again!","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"Out of all the action movies that I have ever watched,this would be one of my favorite as there is no cheesy romantic scenes which waste time and instead there is a few comedic scenes which I would rather prefer.Despite not watching the cartoons and collecting figurines,I found the movie rather enjoyable. The film stars Shia Labeouf,Megan Fox,Josh Duhamel,Tyrese Gibson,John Turturro,Jon Voight and up and coming Australian actress Rachel Taylor. This movie had great action scenes and comedic scenes and I am glad there was no cheesy romantic scenes that feature prominently in other action films. If there were more action films like this with less romantic scenes,then there would be more meaning to action films.","Jun 30, 2007",10,/10
"I should first mention that I am a hardcore old-school Transformers Generation 1 (TF G1) fan. When I was about 8 or 9, TF G1 was my favorite cartoon. Only two other cartoons since then have had any kind of impact on me, those are GI Joe, which ran about the same time period as TF, and Batman the Animated Series which ran in the early 90s after I became a big Batman movie fan. Take my review as you will...I think that this movie was neither an incredible embarrassment to the old series, nor was it a great tribute either.Let me start with what I thought was bad. There were many things that upset me about this movie. To begin with, I was never an advocate of a live-action TF movie at all. I felt that if another TF movie was made, it should be all CG, like Cars or Toy Story, or it should be animated just like the original series, but using fancy new animation techniques of course. I always thought that TF in a live-action setting would end up being pretty hokey, and I think I was right. I was never too happy with the new TF movie designs. I thought they looked like insects. Optimus Prime and Jazz were the only 2 robots that really looked decent because they were similar to the originals and not so much insect-ish. Megatron and Starscream were the worst and just looked plain ridiculous. Except Peter Cullen w/ Optimus Prime, I also thought most of the voices were lousy. In the original series, Peter Cullen also voiced Ironhide, and he was already in the movie... why couldn't he voice both characters? I must admit that Hugo Weaving made a pretty good Megatron Voice. Jazz's voice sounded silly and bumblebee speaking through/as the radio was annoying and made me angry. The dialogue was so cheesy! Why did they have to cheese it up so much? Prime steps on something and says ""My bad!"" STUPID! The odd-looking girl didn't recognize Sam through 10 years of grade school? What the heck was that all about? Well anyways, I could go on and on about designs, dialogue, voices, etc... but I digress.The good parts of the movie? The action, battle scenes, and storyline were pretty good and in my opinion, balanced out all the bad things from this movie and pulled it up to an average score from me. The plot was good, simple, standard Transformers fare and its something you could see in the old animated show. The action and battles were pretty outstanding. Even though Michael Bay knows absolutely nothing about developing characters, he sure knows how to blow stuff up!Although I went into that movie expecting it to be awful, it wasn't THAT bad. It also wasn't THAT good either. I suggest you set your expectations low, and you probably won't dislike it so much. Of course unless all you want out of movies is thin plots and lots of explosions and special effects... if thats you, this movie should be right up your alley. Well thats all I have to say about that.","Jul 5, 2007",5,/10

"I sometimes wonder if people really do hate Michael Bay. I know there are those who would like to hang him upside-down by his toes from a tree limb and beat him silly with sticks. I never knew what the big deal was. I enjoyed ""The Rock""; a guilty pleasure of mine. I also enjoyed ""The Island"". It was when I saw ""Transformers"" that I understood what everyone was talking about. Only now does that line from a song in ""Team America: World Police"": ""why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?"" make sense to me. In a word, ""Transformers"" is a mess and it may be Bay's fault.This film may have been an excuse to blow up and destroy as many things as possible. And they succeeded. I don't know if there was a building or a house or vehicle that wasn't crushed under the large feet of these mechanical behemoths. Probably because the camera was moving so fast and so choppy that I couldn't see what was going on. You might as well have put me in a washer for two and half hours and ask me to explain my surroundings while I was inside.The screenplay didn't help either. Robots exchanging lines like ""One will stand. One will fall"", ""Do you wanna piece of me?"" ""No, I want two"" and ""Oh s*it"" make the film more and more unbearable. The film's main protagonist, Sam ""Spike"" (he's never called Spike in the film) Witwicky, asks the Transformers how they learned to speak. ""From the World Wide Web"" answers an Autobot. That's good, hopefully they're catching up on recent world events as well. A scene where the Autobots hide from Sam's parents around their house goes from sightly funny to irritating and the Decepticons (the bad guys) don't kill nearly enough humans as they had intended (the entire race).The only thing that may have held this movie together is the ever-popular, and possibly best young leading-man newcomer, Shia LaBeouf. His delivery of some of his lines provide a somewhat comic relief to the growing intolerability of the pace. Although his repeated lines of ""No no no no"" as his situation worsens gets older and older, there is still that hint of realism since the film itself seems so fake.If you're looking for a summer blockbuster ""Transformers"" has what you're looking for. You'll definitely get all the bangs, booms, and explosions for your buck. But if you're looking for something at least entertaining, why not try the theater next door and peek in on a guy named John McClane.Review by Glenn D. Harvey","Jul 11, 2007",2,/10
"This movie is full of ads and propagandas. It's advertising flash memories, cell phones, cars, etc. And contains lots of military show offs. The story sucks too, rule the earth so what? these bots seem to have no needs, even energy to run them. There is also some weird scenes, such as:-Where did Barricade go? -How did Sam survive the fall from the skyscraper and the fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron? he should have been crushed flat! -Scorponok stays out of the village when it attacks Qatar base survivors. Why didn't he go to the village and put all of them on skewer?! Maybe then they couldn't set up an air support deployment show. -Nobody notices Frenzy when he sneaks out of the aircraft after attempting to steal data. -Megatron cuts the statue that Sam has been holding and causes him to fall off the skyscraper. Why didn't he go and get the Allspark properly? Maybe this was for adding some minutes to the movie.""Nokias are really nasty. You got to respect Japanese. They know the way of Samurai.""

"I like Spielberg and Bay, really. From the first time I heard that Transformers were hitting through the wide-screen, I was thrilled. With the satisfying trailers announced weekly, my appetite was growing because I liked to watch Transformers each week when I was 10 years old. It was one of my favorites such as He-Man, Voltron, Robotech and so on, and I used to have a big picture of ""Optimus Prime"" on my wall.The time I first heard that the movie was due to 2007, I really had my doubts about it because I was wondering how they would carry this plot to an actual movie. I saw it on Saturday night, and I have to admit that it was truly disappointing. As I get into the theater I had my first impression by seeing 10 year old crawling on the seats. Then the movie started and I was about to go and get my 15 YTL's back. The movie was only offering teen-trash to people. Of course I was not expecting an Oscar nominee and just wanted to see expensive special fx. But, the filmmakers should be aware that it just shouldn't be the only reason to attract the audience. If they are spending 100 millions of dollars for the effects, they should at least keep their 1-2 million for a descent screen writing. I mean the movie was really poor on the plot. OK lots of aliens are coming from outside the planet and they are fighting. That's it???. Give me a break... After JP, the movie industry has turned into a rich PC game demo and now everyone is doing movies according to the developing computer technology. But is that enough? If you are 10-12 years old or just want to free your mind without thinking about the plot of the movie, I can recommend this action flick. It presents you lots of explosions, good sound effects, lovely people (tx to newly introduced Megan Fox), stupid sexual jokes (for 8 year old) and that's it. But if not, I would bet that you'll be begging to the pay-box to get your money back.3 out of 10","Jul 9, 2007",3,/10

"OK first off, Im a huge fan of The Transformers Animated Movie from way back and the Series was pretty good and I watched most of them. But still love the Animated Movie and Im 35 now. I went into Transformers with much of an open mind that it would at least be somewhat nostalgic. And other than a few words that Optimus Prime spoke ""One shall stand. One Shall Fall."" I couldn't stand to sit to the end of the movie. The Transformers were ugly, extremely bulky and fake looking. They weren't streamlined at all which made them look even more absurd when they were dancing around like kung fu masters. And gliding on the Freeway, even though they had no wheels on their feet. Its like they were just ghosts. All of the combat looked like it was happening on a whole different layer than the scenery it was attached to. Even though rockets and bullets are flying everywhere. THere didn't seem to be much of it affecting the enviorment at all other than a few specific obstacles. The Autobots, maybe 6 of them in all. Had very little Personality at all, unlike the old series. The Decepticons had NO personality period other than Megatron who was only in the movie a few minutes and barely spoke a word other than to utter a few memorable lines from the old movie but said with much less Flair or Conviction. Often when an Autobot would speak it seems to come from speakers outside of them, rather than from the autobots. Which of course they are, but it shouldn't seem so, like any actors. Its like they were terribly dubbed with soundbites from the old movie, but slowed down and more automated. The little robots were clunky bug type things not at all like some of the old guys that would pop out of Soundwave. Of course there's no Soundwave this time. The plot was HORRIBLE! Every time the human kid spoke, I just wanted someone to squash his head. His Hot girlfriend was far better than him who was serious all the time and seemed to understand what was going on better than him. This movie is so goofy, its laughable. And Im saying that based on the Old Animated Movie which was 10 times more serious and complex and made a hell of a lot more sense. This is the worst looking movie by Michael Bay so far. It was like a computer game with really bad graphics. But Im sure those interested will see for themselves, its hard to resist. But prepare to sit in Horror at how little thought and consideration of the True Transformers, went into this pile of overblown Rock Em Sock Em Robots.","Jul 11, 2007",2,/10

There are good jokes, soldiers are shooting evil robots, the robots transform to great cars and planes etc etc etc. The visual effect are perfect. I could not believe my eyes when Megatron transformed into a plane. And the interaction between humans and robots are also perfect; I have no idea how the visual effects were done. They are better then the visual effects in Heroes.Finally, after 8 years, there is a movie that can compete with ""The Matrix"".","Sep 3, 2008",10,/10
"Transformers was definitely worth sitting in the movie theater until 1am for. Michael Bay is a directorial genius and the cast was so excellently picked, it was almost fate. Never a dull moment. I didn't even want to go to the bathroom. I took my 5 and 7 year old kids, so for a mom wondering if it is appropriate. DEFINITELY! My kids were screaming how awesome the movie was after it was over. I cannot wait for the DVD release definitely a movie for your personal DVD collection. I would pay to see it again. I was a kid that grew up on Transformers and to see Optimus Prime transform in front of me all of these years later, I was so pumped up when I arrived home at 1:30 in the morning from the movie theater, I couldn't sleep until 3am.

The pace was good, and it's humor was pretty good too(definitely not as bad as the sequel's).I think the best part's pf this movie is the soundtrack and the special effects, they were REVOLUTIONARY, especially the scene where we meet the autobots for the first time, it is my favorite movie scene ever.Fans of the original may not be too happy with some of the changes, but the film has some great homages to the original television series, which should tide the fans over until a BETTER sequel.I strongly encourage you not only to watch this film, but to OWN IT. you won't regret it.","Apr 24, 2011",10,/10

What does it add to the story, other than crude jokes and an excuse to tilt up and down some hot chick's midriff? How about NOTHING! This film should have just been Transformers and the military, that's what we want to see, not bodily fluids being unleashed and cheap sex references so MTV-martyrs can get a laugh! Why all the GM advertising? Are the kids who are going to bug their parents to buy them all the toys going to buy cars after the movie ends, too? Good lord! So Megatron can survive deep space, which is more frigid than we can imagine, but he can't sustain himself in a glacier? Wow Bay, you are so talented! Ever notice a similar theme in every Michael Bay film, that of a Caucasian loser (except the Bad Boys films) trying so hard to score with a few action sequences thrown in? I'm officially boycotting any film with his name attached to it for life. I had my doubts about this, and sure as heck, they manifested before my eyes!","Aug 21, 2007",1,/10
"I hold one man responsible. He has directed everything from a man commuting to work being terrorized by a ghostly-demonic, semi-truck; to the life and trials of a young black woman; to, quite possibly, the greatest, most intimate, most stunning, war motion picture ever presented to an audience. In my mind, I will no longer think of him as a director.Steven Spielrock, I mean Steven Spielberg, should be referred to as a master filmmaker.Imagine, for a moment, having done so very much as a storyteller. But, there's a catch: YOU LOVE MOVIES as much as the next rabid, movie-going mutant. So, an idea has landed in your lap about a dormant franchise of warring, ""robot-sapiens"" that screams to be made into a blockbusting, popcorn enabling, epic of action science-fiction. This is probably the most elaborate and complex production since Matrix: Revolutions AND your directorial schedule is chock FULL for at least the next two and a half years. What do you do? Seriously, what do you do?First. You hire a director that has a ""third eye"" capable of filming dazzling and amazing sequences of controlled chaos, but some say he has weaknesses. Then, You grab a great editor He has worked with because this person is capable of converting the director's controlled chaos into jaw-dropping, eye-popping, action sequences, Plural. Second. You gather a cast that can drive the elements of the story (especially comedy) that need to be carried very well to the end of the story. You also put the best people that you have worked with in key departments like, Production Management, Set Decoration and Art Direction. 'Cause you still gotta keep the largest automaker on the planet happy with their product placement throughout the movie, right?And last but, ABSOLUTELY Not least; you hire not one but two, TWO visual effects supervisors. Why? Well . . . go see the movie. When you love your job, do you take pride in doing it right? I believe Steven Spielberg does . . .","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10
"I'm sick and tired of Hollywood pushing trash on the plate of the American people and expecting us to pay to eat it all up. That's the case with Transformers. The Hype far outmatched the crappy movie itself. It features nothing but ridiculous action set pieces and horribly fake looking CGI robots. There's NOTHING to enjoy because the CGI is just that bad.Why does anyone think the butt ugly CGI looks anything but fake? The robots themselves don't react well with their environment. You never, not for one single moment, believe the wild and silly things seen on screen. Nothing carries any weight and nothing feels even remotely believable. (Even if you're eight years old and believe what you see, why fire guns at them? Firing tiny metal at giant robots is akin to hurling ground hamburger at human beings) This mess of a movie will make good money right off the bat (unfortunately) but word of mouth will kill it fast.

"Let me begin by saying this: To all of you who never saw the original 1987 animated version (I personally watched it upwards of 200 times as a child) or watched the series as a kid, you will not fully understand how awesome this movie is to those of us who did. Even if you liked it, even if your about to give this a 10 out of 10 like I did, you will still not completely grasp what Michael Bay has done here. He has perfectly mastered my childhood in a two hour movie. Bumblebee: perfect, the second he started talking like he did in that original version I was hooked (not that I hadn't been since seeing the first previews leek out months and months ago); Optimus Prime and his ""corny lines"": Couldn't have been better, they completely captured the good versus evil battle that is transformers, I was practically screaming the lines sitting there; Megatron's ability to still send shivers down my spine: Better than any horror movie I've ever seen...period.I could go on but I only get 1,000 words here and I want to give credit where credit is due. Anyone working on those special effects, you couldn't have made that an more real, it was stunning and left me gaping the entire time. Michael Bay, I don't care how many terrible movies you might have done, this one was (in the words of Vince Vaughn in ""Swingers"") MONEY BABY! Go direct 100 more Armageddons, you'll still be high on my list. Shia Labeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese, Anthony Anderson, John Voight, John Turturro and everyone else on down to the extras, THANK YOU! You made a 20 year old guy transform back into a five year old kid tonight in that movie theater. As good as Prime, Bumblebee, Megatron, Starscream and the rest of the crew were, the movie wouldn't have been s*** without the live actors being as good as the were. Shia Labeouf is a sure thing Hollywood, look out for this kid.On an end note, as a transformers purist (yes I even saw the animated sequel countless times) I can't see how any of you fellow fans-from-birth can have a problem with this movie. They hit the nail on the head in every way imaginable. I thought Peter Jackson performed the greatest feat in movies by doing the greatest trilogy ever made, hands down, while sticking to the LOTR plot line as best he could. This single achievement comes incredibly close and for being just one movie, instead of one out of three, it gets my nod as my personal favorite. I'll tell anyone whose willing to listen that you need to see this movie. Not on your television, not on your 60"" plasma or your projector with surround sound. Go to your local movie theater grab some popcorn (actually scratch that, bring your own), sit down and enjoy. You won't leave disappointed, trust me.","Jul 5, 2007",10,/10
"i finally saw this movie in IMAX,and it was worth that wait.i enjoyed it for the most part.there are a few scenes i felt they didn't need,but overall,it's a pretty good movie.the story and the acting are not exactly profound or groundbreaking.but it is entertaining.however in my mind,The CGI in this movie is groundbreaking.the action scenes are some of the best i have seen.they are quite electrifying.i also really liked the look of the Transformers themselves.the special effects are seamless,in my opinion.i liked the humour in the film,especially involving The Transformers themselves.they also each had different personalities and quirks,so they weren't just two dimensional characters.in addition,it thought the voices for each of the Transformers fit the characters very well.the only negative i can think of is that the acting is a bit suspect,at times,but i won't get any more specific than that.otherwise,especially because of the outstanding CGI effects,it is still well worth watching.for me,Transformers is a 8.5/10","Oct 11, 2007",9,/10
"I grew up with the original generation 1 TF cartoon series (man I feel dated LOL) back in 1984. This was a revolutionary series, full of action and wonderful animation. Granted back then the execs of Hasbro and those at Sunbow thought of this show as a 30 commercial for their toy line, but for millions of kids the show was so much more.Now we fast forward to 2007 and Michael Bay's version, and there are no words to describe this. Let's start off with one of the most iconic characters, Optimus Prime.Of course his design is not as I, or others who grew up remembered (a flat nosed red, silver and dark blue semi with silver trailer), but the new design just fits the character perfectly. Next we have to take the iconic voice actor of Peter Cullen. I would have been so disappointed if Peter had chosen not to reprise his role of Prime. He has done many 80's cartoons and some of later, but this character (and even Iron Hide) are the most memorable.For the CGI. It is the best I have ever seen, and is the most realistic and glitch free to date. I can't even comprehend the computer power this thing must have taken to render the images. WELL DONE!!! I was saddened that Frank Welker was unable to perform as Megatron as he did so brilliantly in the original series 23 years ago. However the voice that was used for Megatron felt closer to Leonard Nemoy's Galvatron from animated Transformers The Movie (1986).I hope there is a sequel in the coming years to Transformers the movie. My hope is that the writers take what they did in this movie and ramp it up to the nth degree.Thank you to Michael Bay, Steven Spielberg, the cast and crew of Transformers for keeping this iconic tale that began over 4 millions ago alive.","Jul 9, 2007",10,/10
"If you are looking for a movie that has a story or has any meaning -- don't bother with transformers.I have never been disappointed by a movie as much as transformers even though I was a big fan of the comic since childhood and has been looking forward to this blockbuster, after watching the spectacular trailer.Transformers the movie feels like it was written by a 14-year old with the corniest, irrelevant, juvenile and unfunny lines ever spoken on screen. the plot is not great but as blockbusters go, at least it has one, a very unoriginal one. It is racist as black comedians play to the stereotype and so pro-industrial military complex!!! BUT the biggest problem I have with this movie is that it did not make you feel anything. It was just flat throughout and I was BORED. It was not scary (we are talking big live alien robots here!), it was NOT funny (jokes were stale!), there was no suspense (we know who won!) Optimus prime, bumble bee were NOT given much of a personality for you to care enough for. They tried to make Shia Le bouf character the one to root for but c'mon -- this is transformers the movie. And shia, to his credit as a good actor, tries not to appear shallow but does his best peter parker impressions. He is not spiderman unfortunately.I walked out of the show feeling truly cheated -- how can they spend millions on special effects and hardly any effort on story.If there is ONE thing positive to say -- it is the special effects are spectacular -- they make the robots come alive and you get enough shots of every robot you want.My feeling though is that -- with such good special effects, certainly one of the best I have seen on screen -- they leave nothing to the imagination and I feel robs away reason why we go to movies in the first place.I am staying away from BLOCKBUSTERS from now on.","Jun 29, 2007",1,/10
"What a movie! Transformers must be one of the best movies (if not the best one) of the year. Though I belong to the Transformers generation (1980's) I was never really hooked up with the franchise and couldn't recall any of the transformers names aside from Opitmus Prime and Megatron if you had asked me.Having seen the trailer I went to see the movie knowing that I was in for some eye candy special effects, but not so sure of the overall story. But as the transformers slogan goes the movie was ""more than meets the eye"".Knowing more or less what the main theme of the ever-changing saga of the transformers is, I though this movie had many reasons to turn out silly and have nothing more to offer that visual effects I mean we are talking about robotic aliens, with human emotions, simplistically separated into a team of goody good autobots and the all-evil decepticons. Oh yeah and they turn into trucks and other vehicles and planes for some reason in a nut shell I thought it would be an fun take on the transformers cartoon and toy line at best but it's so much more.It has actually avoided the cheesiness of most ""America under attack"" movies focusing on the human characters as well as the transformers. Fresh characters presented with a touch of humour that each has his/her own gravity in the story and aren't just fillers to help the plot unfold. Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky does a great job at becoming the underdog we all sympathise for, who ends up becoming the hero (reminding us how we all felt for Peter Parker in the first Spider-man movie). It is action packed from beginning to end but you never get enough of it. The visuals are astonishingly well made not distracting from the movie with thoughts ""that looked fake"" and besides the effects, there are many scenes with great visual interest. I enjoyed the music and sound effects (especially the transforming ones) and as a hole the movie worked so good. A must see for all ages and genders, shapes and sizes.On the downside it was a bit too long and some scenes coul have been shorter, but everything is so well made that you enjoy every bit of it! I for one am not ashamed to admit my excitement over this movie. A must see!","Jul 22, 2007",10,/10
"Seriously, what a piece of crap!!! This picture like a typical Michael Bay movie has good special effects but simply the movie is so stupid I'm actually starting to feel brain damaged. The movie is an attack to the intellect with just a few laughs. Michael Bay is horribly unskilled behind the camera, thanks to this, the action scenes, the core of a movie like this, are extremely ineffective and the never-ending advertising is horribly annoying. I hated this movie. Don't watch this, is not worthy of the time. Thinks like this makes you wonder how does the people in Hollywood think about us, do they think we're stupid? Do they think we're ignorant? Do we give them any reason to think different? Based on the money made by this it looks like it. Shame, shame of us... pity of us. 7/100.","Jul 28, 2007",1,/10
"I have been waiting since I saw the first trailer. This movie well exceeded my expectations. Plot was good and acting was good. If you are expecting ""Oscar worthy"" or ""Artistic"" that is not what this is about. Understand this is an action movie. I have heard some people ripping this movie because it was ""cheesey."" HELLO it is (as I am) a product of the 80's. What isn't cheesy that came out of that era?!?! It had so much more to offer then I thought possible. The effect were outstanding (that should be a given). But this movie was so entertaining. My Wife, who I had to drag to the theater, actually commented that it was ""awesome."" I can't wait to see it again, and then buy the DVD and then wait for the sequel :-)","Jul 5, 2007",10,/10
"I've never been a huge fan of Michael Bay (I thought Pearl Harbor sucked), but OH MAN did he hit it out of the ballpark with Transformers! I am one who grew up with Transformers, so I was highly skeptical of this project when I first heard about it. Transformers delivers on so many fronts - action, humor, romance, sci-fi - that I found myself wishing it wouldn't end after just 2 hours and twenty minutes. Shia Lebouf did a fantastic job lending just the right amount of personality and humor to Sam ""Spike"" Witwicky, the CGI robots themselves oozed with personality, and the action was just jaw-dropping. As an added bonus, Bay employed some great character actors like John Turturro, John Voigt, and Anthony Anderson to complement a decent, though in no way perfect, script.I think the icing on the cake for us Tranformers fans is the dedication Bay put in to making this a movie for the fans. Getting Peter Cullen (the original voice of Optimus Prime in the cartoon series) back as the voice of the Autobot leader was pure genius, and was a move that definitely hit a positive nerve with this movie-goer. For those who never really watched the old 1980's cartoon series, you have nothing to worry about. While Bay took great care to satisfy fans, I feel that he also did a nice job bringing in everyone else with the action, story-line, and acting. My wife, for example, never watched the cartoon series, but thoroughly enjoyed this movie.I can't wait for the sequel - especially to see which new Autobots and Decepticons are used!","Jul 8, 2007",9,/10
"I was so looking forward to this film since i first heard about it. Transformers was a favourite of mine as a child so this was a great nostalgic film as well as an utterly amazing one.The CGI is flawless and you realise how little they gave away in the trailers, which is a great thing when you see the film. The storyline is there too, and while its not the deepest or full one ever this is an action sci-fi film, not a romance or anything. you paid to go see giant robots fight, not to sympathise with the protagonist on a deeply personal level.or anyone who loved the cartoons or for anyone who loves films this one is definitely for you. easily one of the best films I've seen this year. So go one, watch it and enjoy it as much as i did. This film had me thinking i was about 12 again and i loved it for it.Enjoy!","Jul 23, 2007",10,/10
I'll give Tranformers this their special effects were great. However if you're the kind of person that doesn't drool over them this movie should be avoided. It was like watching fire works lots of bright flashing lights. Sometimes the movie was a blur due to the special effects. It was the worst acting I've ever seen. This gets my vote for fakest (I know fakest is not a word) movie ever made. With a good cast you'd figure you'd see good acting. I'm ashamed I spent even a penny to see this film and would've left the movie early if I wasn't too busy laughing at the actors/actresses! The movie genre should be that of a comedy. Megan Fox i'm sorry honey but just model please get out of acting now.,"Sep 13, 2007",1,/10
"Their War. Our World.Some will Come To Defend Us Most Will Come To Destroy UsI caught a special screening of Transformers 7 days before it released here, which i am happy to point out to all those unlucky people that have to wait until it is nationally released. Ha ha. Anyway, you would think that a movie of this magnitude would start off slow so that people that haven't been into Transformers could get some background, but you couldn't be more wrong!. It still gives a detailed background of the alien beings but slow is definitely not the case! The Action is from start to finish. You need to actually watch the movie to know how good it is, the wit, the action and special effects are top of the range and will be hard to beat. This is most definitely going to take some prizes this year i am sure of it.This has to be the first movie that at the end, the audience clapped loudly hoping for a encore... and the adrenaline rush was mad it flowed through us like blood.I can't even begin to describe it for you, but if i could give a higher rating than 10 it would be 101.","Jul 28, 2007",10,/10

"Best movie of 2007 is a bit of a drastic title to give a film -- especially when 2007 hasn't even ended yet -- but nothing, in my opinion, has matched Transformers, and I don't anticipate anything coming that close for a long time.I have some things I have to admit right away. Growing up, I was never a Transformers fan. Now, I must have watched at least ONE episode because I went into the theater knowing exactly who Megatron and Optimus Prime were (Of course, that could have just been because of good advertising). Secondly, I've never been a fan of sci-fi and/or action movies. But in the same way that Taylor Swift won me over to country by her sweet melodies, Transformers stole my heart.It's a movie that I don't think anybody will be disappointed with. As little as possible CGI was used, but what CGI WAS used meshed VERY well with the live action. The characters were very well developed. Of every moment of every second, I was on the edge of my seat. Hell, I think that even despite the mild sexual humor and swearing that was used, EVERYBODY could enjoy this film.All in all, a lot of films these days are half-assed. They are good ideas put into good scripts that produce good movies. GOOD. Not GREAT. Transformers, on the other hand, was FANTASTIC. GREAT JOB!","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10

I hate you Michael bay, I really do. you raped our childhood. yeah, it made money so it's successful, which makes me sick. do you really get validation from kids who like your movie. no one will consider this a good film in 10 years. do you feel good about yourself for making films that 10 year olds like and no one else does? news flash, a 10 year old will watch anything with giant robots on the screen.... and don't get me started on your disrespect for the franchise (i.e. flames on the side of the truck) I can just imagine you directing the new star trek film and saying, well I don't like Spock's ears, so let's make Spock have horns, cause horns are cool.

"What Michael Bay lacks is the fact that film is about artistic merit, not how many explosions or stunts you have. Bay is never clever with the camera for this badly made flick, he simply relies on patheticly glamourising a classic retro cartoon series.It's hard to understand what anyone sees in this tedious drag, with Shia bumbling constantly in his repeated 'Even Stevens' act, Megan Fox performing as good as a house brick and the cult Transformer characters given urban attitudes, its easy to see that this is just another Hollywood mess.There's nothing to highlight in this science-fiction action epic, there are some funny moments and the great Peter Cullen returns to voice Optimus Prime (Cullen's voice-over gives the film it's extra star).With more product placement than creative imagery to boast, Bay's Transformers is awful and a key movie to highlight when it comes to explaining why business shouldn't come before art in film. It actually made me feel dizzy watching it, if your going to make an animated series into a film, do it properly because the majority of these characters do not appear in the Japnese cartoons and its all to appeal towards the numb minded teenagers.Badly written, boring and nothing special.","Feb 3, 2009",2,/10

Half way thru the movie I keep checking my watch because I don't want to be over, I need more because to be honest the last three blockbuster movie is not as good as I expected so I'm relive that finally this summer offer at least one ""see it again movie"".

"I don't remember enjoying a theater experience more than this. I remember a couple of spots where are almost had tears because I was having that much fun. This movie is why they make theaters, period! The CGI & Live action flowed seamlessly! The lines were barely cheesy. Everything worked so well. I applaud Bay & Spielberg for putting together an incredibly interesting and never boring plot as well. This movie far exceeded my high expectations. If you do take young ones, be prepared to be asked ""What's masturbation?"" I most definitely will see this again in the theater. The new Digital Projectors make it that much better as well. I could try, but I do not have 1 bad thing to say. Even the 2 1/2 hours did not even seem long. I didn't want it to end. Well, well done!","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10
"Jaw dropping action for two and a half hours. Breathless? No. Because you don't want to pass out and miss a minute of it. You want this movie to go faster because you want to know what happens, but at the same time, you want it to go slower because you can't get enough of it. Hundreds of transforming, yet still not enough, and it never loses its ""cool"" effect. Absolutely amazing direction! Well done Michael Bay. Special effects have surpassed the benchmark. Although there are some brief moments of awkward forced romance or comedy, which seem out of place, they give you ample time to catch your breath. But for every one of those, boy is there enough action to make this movie a smash hit! This is what you call a movie!!! A MUST SEE!

"While this movie had great special effects and was visually impressive during the action scenes it would make anyone a fan of Transformers happy well, except for the fact that Optimus had lips that moved when he talked, not sure why he had lips he's a robot. However, any movie goer will be disappointed at how juvenile and weak this film was. This was the first movie i've ever started to get up to leave the theater but quickly remembered that the theater costs $10.50 now and i should stay to get my money's worth. The new one looks to be more of the same so if you enjoyed the cheesy dialog, weak story and juvenile humor of the first one enjoy the second. Me personally, I think Bay should just stop making films, he is just bad.","Jun 25, 2009",1,/10

"I respect how much time and effort it would have taken to create this film. The special effects are spectacular and the locations are wonderful, you can tell it took a lot of work.Shame it sucks as a piece of film-making on so many levels.The plot is clichéd and unconvincing. Every few minutes there was another moment where I had to tut with bemusement. Many scenes are completely unnecessary, such as the house scene, which in the end he finds the glasses in the kitchen. I think we could have done without that 5 minutes of hideousness thank you very much. 5 minutes we could have been seeing a longer car chase. If you look, the ""chase"" goes by in an instant and nothing actually happens. The cars skid a few times and then its over. There are numerous instances of set-pieces which lack punch. The desert scene, one of them. The word is lacklustre.Bay obviously thinks a still shot is murder and audiences are going to fall asleep if there's isn't a dolly being used for every clip. The constant movement of the camera grates on me. But maybe that's just because I analyse it closely. Stick with the special effects Michael and get someone who know how to make films.Oh yeah and whats-her-name who's with Shia. What the Hell is the point of her? (Other than eye-candy) I have come to the conclusion that this is the ultimate popcorn film. By which I mean something to just watch and not have to think about it. This is because it just doesn't work as anything else.On the whole, it's OK entertainment but a horrible film.","Jan 17, 2009",5,/10
"I thought that a movie about giant alien robots kicking each other's ass would be lame and crappy. That the human actors would look silly and stupid in it. But I was WRONG. Michael Bay has definitely raised the Bar for the standards when doing live action adaption of a fictional character/s like Superman, Batman, Spiderman, which are not human but of are pure CGI. This movie made care about bumble bee like his a real person, or hate Megatron that much that he has evil deep routed in his core. The action's and the humor was so well placed in the movie that there is almost no drag time that would make you cringe. With excellent visual effects, decent plot, and tons of kick-ass actions, this easily the blockbuster movie of the year. For the fans, it will re-affirms our affinity for these Mechanical creatures and for those new to the Transformer cult will surely be transformed!. Go see it in the big screen while it last. I will definitely collect DVD of this title when it comes up.","Jul 2, 2007",10,/10
"I will not give you the plot as I am sure, by now most people know what it is about. Many critics have said that this film is only for teenage boys. That is correct as this film ticks all the right boxes. Hot chicks, computers, special effects, clanging metal, and of course the stars of the show : The Transformers. But strangely, this film gives you so much more than all of that once you have opened your mind. I went in not knowing what to expect. My boyfriend loved Transformers as a young boy so he was probably always going to love it. But for me, it was all new. Boy was I blown away. From the humour (yes,humour) courtesy of leading man/boy Shia Lebeouf's character Sam, to the absolutely mind boggling special effects and the well paced nature of the film. Transformers never leaves you bored, there is always something going on. And there are plenty of laughs along the way. Along with the obligatory lump in the throat moment courtesy of Spielberg. Each actor is perfectly cast, particularly Lebeouf (Sam Witwicky)and Jon Voight's portrayal of the Defence Secretary. But like I said before, the real stars are the Transformers. As Spielberg has done before with CGI animated characters, he made them not only real but almost human in their personality, humour and abilities. You can't help but love them all. I am purely talking about the Autobots of course. Because the Decepticons are bad guys! But even they are fantastic characters. My only moan is that they weren't shown more! The special effects are truly spectacular, so spectacular that at times, it is hard to keep up with what is going on, on screen. I will not spoil it for you but the way they transform from vehicles into a fully fledged combatant is absolutely awesome. So to sum up, don't listen to the critics, go the film with an open mind and go with the incentive to have a total couple of hours escapism. And you never know, you might just love it. And that goes for us girls too!","Aug 2, 2007",10,/10
"I'm not going to be stupid and say this is the greatest movie of all time - because it really isn't. But is it the best ""blockbuster"" movie we have seen in a while? Most definitely! So many ""fans"" have been complaining about the updating of the vehicles, and failure to stick to the story of the G1 cartoon series... but this in 2007 - not 1987! The movie is done in such a way that you don't need to be a fan to enjoy to it; I saw this with some friends who grew up with up with Transformers, and some that didn't, and no one left disappointed.This film is pretty much what you would expect from a 'Michael Bay summer blockbuster' - cheesy dialogue, minimal plot, and more action than you can shake a stick at. The animation is absolutely incredible and the Transformation scenes alone are worth the price of admission.So if you are looking for a deep and meaningful film, then this will not be for you. But if you just want to laugh and sit on the edge of you seat as trucks and planes transform into robots and beat the living tar out of each other then you can't go wrong with this.","Jun 27, 2007",10,/10
"I remember the cartoons from the 80's and they were not particularly good compared to say Battle of the Planets. The cartoon was basically about shifting units of toys. The toys themselves looked pretty good. Like He-Man and others of that ilk it was all about being bright and flashy with nothing to engage young minds. I watched this film on Film4 at 9pm. Why they chose this time to show, what is basically a children's film is beyond me. The humour was stale and dragged out and schoolboy level. I love action movies, but this was by the numbers Hollywood pap. Lots of bang for your buck, but no story to speak of. Dire. This movie sums up what is wrong with Hollywood action movies these days. Too much reliance on special effects and hardly any story. Now I know why people groan when they hear a movie is being directed by Michael Bay.","Dec 13, 2010",2,/10
"Michael Bay the king of special effects keeps us all awake from the beginning to the end. The ""ahhs and oohhhs"" and how did they do this were running rampant in the theater. And prototype Camaro was cool. But I can not honestly give this movie a 10 because effects alone can not carry a movie and Michael should know this, after all he was on ""The Lot"" critiquing.This movie's script has dated cliché lines from years ago and the actors seem like high school play actors reciting the dialog they put together. The parents with their comedic focus on their son and his doings fall a little short,maybe the actors, not sure. The fight scenes are far too many during this movie and boringly drag on and on, maybe I should blame the Editor...too much of a good thing is not so good. I found myself hoping there was more to the climatic end. I also thought based on earlier in the movie, if the cube was put in the chest it would cause death, but it obviously didn't. And speaking of the end, we see TRANS2 in the future and for variety maybe Michael Bay will give other automaker's prototypes a try.","Jul 5, 2007",8,/10
"Transformers is a story with great potential. The sad part about it is that the only attempt to exploit this capacity is using incredible computer graphics.I just wonder, why if you invest so much in having such great animations of the Transformers then why don't do the same to get a hold of great actors that won't spoil the work of the computer engineers? The actors might get away with their cheesy and fake acting given that this movie is somewhat targeted towards a young pg-13 audience. However, it wasn't the actors' poor performance what didn't let me enjoy the movie but the obvious insertion of General Motors and US Military advertisements.I got exhausted of counting scenes of the different GM brands getting thrown at my face. But it seems the guys at Fint weren't satisfied with all this visuals and shots of (even) one of their dealers; they also had to include in the script comments about how something so complex (as a Transformer) had to be Japanese to later on transform into a Chevrolet.For God's sake, if I ever wanted to see some kind of complex robot transform into a car it definitively won't be a Pontiac! Didn't Mr. Bay know about Ferraris, Hummers, and other more fitted vehicles for this type of movie? Lines like ""You can bet my ridiculous government salary."" makes the effort to make the US Military job attractive so evident.I think we all pay to go to the movies to be entertained not to sit and watch an almost 3 hour-long universal studios like ride advertisement.Clearly a couple of Thank You For Smoking-Style lobbyists passed by Hollywood in an effort to increase some car sales, soldiers and maybe direct some traffic to the slowly dying website, eBay.","Jul 15, 2007",1,/10
"Transformers is a great summer popcorn action film. It's great fun, with impressive CGI effects that almost make you believe Optimus Prime, Megatron, and the rest of the 'bots are actually there. The human actors do a great job interacting with non-existent robots. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a high schooler who is looking to get his first car. Little does he know that his car is a transformer from the planet Cybertron, a member of the Autobots, who are looking to stop the Decepticons from taking over Earth. After we are introduced to LaBeouf and Megan Fox's characters, the robot fighting ensues.The action sequences are great to look at. All the little details really matter here, and seeing the gears of the Transformers as they go from robot to vehicle mode, it's pretty damn good. The acting feels real, albeit with some bad dialogue here and there. But the real stars of the film are the Transformers themselves. Optimus Prime is voiced by Peter Cullen, who voiced him in the original cartoon in the 1980s.There are some touching moments in the film, especially between Sam and Bumblebee, his car and guardian. When Bumblebee is captured by Sector 7, it almost brings a tear to my eye seeing Sam's reaction and trying to help Bee out.The music of the movie is beautiful to listen to. Steve Jablonsky does a great job composing the music. You feel the emotion of what is going on in the scene through the music, like the aforementioned scene with Bee and Sam, and especially during some of the fight scenes where the music picks up.All in all, Transformers is a solid film to watch, especially during the summer, with that summer feel it has to it. Whether you're a fan of Transformers, or just looking for a fun flick to watch, then give this one a try.","Oct 11, 2011",10,/10
"Transformers as a movie is completely breath taking and has a large fan base to make it a box office hit. People will go and watch this movie, heck I went to watch it because it reminded me of when I saw it on the telly. This is my opinion:Adapting something from a classic is never easy, but the directing team has aimed more at strong human emotions, than the actual robotics. In a breath I'd say Transformers must have touched every half a teenager in the audience.(""Hey I know that guy"") Thus ""The Transformers effect"" will make every Greenpeace activist wish that they had seen Lassie saves the cheerleader instead. Viva la robotics.I did enjoy it, hope you do as well.Enjoy.","Jul 12, 2007",9,/10
"When I heard that there was going to be a Transformers movie I pretty much rolled my eyes and assumed it would be yet another comic-like movie with bad acting, corny love-scenes and over-done special effects.However, after hearing several rave-reviews from friends, I figured I'd give it a go...after all...I wasn't paying! The opening scene with the narration had me going...""Oh God"", thinking it would be one of those movies! But not long into the movies I was in awe as how brilliant it was! The special-effects were brilliant, acting was pretty great and Josh Duhamel was drool-worthy.Much better than I ever thought it would be, I'm considering seeing it again!","Jul 13, 2007",8,/10

They are AWFUL! Shia LaDouche really needs to go the way of Heath Ledger, as soon as possible. I HATE that ignorant no talent moron.

"First of all I'd like to say that this movie is not for children! None of Bay's movies are for children... I saw how couple parents with their children were leaving in the middle of the movie.Michael Bay has visual and vocal signatures in all of his movies. And as I heard that this movie was his creation, I went to theater without a doubt. I was greatly surprised, because it overcame my expectations. The visual effects are as real as life. The movie is spectacularly dynamical. The actors are fresh, and the jokes are really funny.I presume that most of you saw the trailer... Well, whatever you see in the trailer, the whole movie is like it and a lot more - Masterpiece!Great work Michael!!!","Jul 21, 2007",10,/10
i saw the movie last night and i was really disappointed... looks like a giant budget cant by a decent script. The special effects were amazing and thats pretty much what kept me watching. Their was a lot of humor and the acting was good. But everything that was said and done was so cliché and it really was just another movie that falls into Hollywood cheesiness. The camera work was really good (really surprised from that) if you want a movie with amazing special effects this is for you... if you want an all around good movie (script) definitely not for you... for me i still liked it but the script made me vomit in my mouth on more than one occasion.,"Jul 3, 2007",1,/10

All those who gave it low marks should lighten up a bit! 1) Its based on a cartoon - it doesn't need to be 100% realistic! 2) Its about robots!!!3) It looked amazing so who really cares?! The CGI was brilliant! The robots not only looked convincing on their own, but they fit into the street scenes perfectly! The action scenes, the interaction with humans and objects, it was breath-taking.So thats why I gave it 10/10. Anyone who has complained about the storyline, plot holes, acting... then yes it had a few issues. But this film isn't suppose to be serious or deep and meaningful.Like I said, its about robots for goodness sake... and the ROBOTS RULED! :-D","Apr 13, 2009",10,/10

"After a lackluster start of threequels (most notably, Spiderman 3), Transformers is a breath of fresh air...and so far it proves to be one of the better summer movies of 2007.Shia LaBeouf does a good job as lead actor, supported by the hot Megan Fox and a few other notably good actors, including Jon Voight and John Turturro. The characters, along with the transformers, provide us with enough humor to be...well, humored.The action as you may have guess is completely bad ass and awesome. The special effects are just about incredible, and I could almost never find myself saying, ""that looks fake"". It looked very real, for the most part.What can I say, this is a Michael Bay film and that means lots of summer fun...and their is enough of a plot to carry the film.8/10, one of the better outings of summer 2007. Perhaps the best, but that we shall see.","Jul 12, 2007",8,/10
"This is one of the worst films I have ever attempted to watch. I have to admit I have not watched it all the way through, in fact I lasted about five minutes before I started flicking through to look for the good action scenes - unfortunately there aren't any. If you like films with lots of CGI and explosions and no story, knock yourself out - literally. I am a fan of the original transformers but the two things bear no relation to each other. I think there is an increase in this kind of thing - the CGI looks like a lot is going on but in fact, there is not a lot of detail. The transforming sequences are extremely disappointing. The story is also rubbish. I cannot find anything to recommend this film. I write this review, not only to annoy my friend but also as a service to the cinema-going public. The current IMDb rating of 7.8 stars is outrageous!","Oct 5, 2007",1,/10

This film is another one of my recent favorites. it doesn't matter if you are a fan of the old cartoons that came on Saturday mornings, or if you are new to the series altogether! You will enjoy this movie! Michael Bay has put out some of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. He definitely does not disappoint with Transformers. The graphics in this film were breathtaking. The seamless transition from computer generated objects to real life was just amazing.The only thing bad about this series is having to wait it out for the next one!","Mar 22, 2008",10,/10

But what can I do now, just nothing.........!!! At least I can share my sorrow with everybody and can strictly advise even the strict adventure/thriller/action movie lovers not to let your time drown.The movie lacks a proper & convincing script and is just plain s**t. Nothing is there to like even the transformation of vehicles in to the Giants. There is nothing to build interest. The whole movie just ended waiting to see something good, interesting and extraordinary as shown in the promos & trailers.In all, a complete lackluster & insane movie with a worst direction ever.

The best I've seen since Dead Man's Chest.And finally the production/direction with the ability to balance all the elements mentioned above to create one of the best action movies to date.

"As far as seamless CG and human interaction goes, this movie scores 11 on a scale of 1-10. Also, the CG action of the robots are unlike anything seen in ANY action movies. Just for these two reasons, this movie is worth watching, but the plot is also great, and the characters are well fleshed out giving this movie the reality other sci-fi movies lacks. It's said that Steven Spielberg is a fan of Transformers, and it shows. You can feel the passion that went into this movie. Also, I think it's the best movie director Michael Bay has ever made. His style translates well for the action of the Transformers. The movie is pretty long (2hrs24min), but it's packed with one great scene to another. Thinking Transformers as kid stuff is wrong here. The movie is PG 13 rated, and there's intelligent plot that makes this not just a good Transformer movie, but a good sci-fi movie as well. It's difficult to imagine another movie with this much well thought out action to appear again anytime soon.","Jun 21, 2008",10,/10

"I just watched it for the second time now and still loved it. Yes i WAS a die hard fan of the G1 series and even loved the 1986 movie. Since that movie i lost interest in all the other incarnations. Now at the age of 25, i find the cartoons very boring, stupid and kiddy. Thus i went into the movie hoping that it wasn't a movie just for kids.As soon as the first action scene with the helicopter was over, i didn't know what to think...it was just so...awesome. But the real surprise was that it gets better and better. The action and special effects were better than anything i have seen to date. The score was epic and touching at times and certainly goes very well with the movie. The acting was okay except for Shia, he did an outstanding job. The most surprising thing about the movie to me, was the amount of humor. Luckily most of the humor worked. in fact, the people in my cinema were actually laughing out loud at all the funny parts.After watching this movie and having time to think about it...i realised that there were some parts that could have been done better and the plot was really basic. However the good greatly outweighs the bad, and to me, while watching the movie none of that matters cause it was just too entertaining! It was certainly more entertaining than the movies being released so far this year.Overall, I recommend this movie for everyone - except really young children and the G1 die hard fans who refuses to except changes.","Jul 12, 2007",8,/10
"Let me explain myself. I'm a Transformers fan so when I first heard that a life action film was being made I was.......well I just couldn't wait for it to come out. Then I saw it. People please don't be fooled by the fancy special effects and the fact that there's a really hot woman thrown in as well. This film is truly awful! Don't get me wrong I like special effects and I really like hot women as well. But those two elements still doesn't shake the fact that the characters are poor (at best, in terms of how they interact and behave), the story is utterly dreadful and words fail me to explain just how bad the dialogue is. Also I was originally quite pleased when I heard that Michael Bay was the director. Bad boys, Bad boys 2, The Rock they were great films. I actually though that Bay would perhaps be the perfect man to direct Transformers. WHAT ON EARTH WENT WRONG MICHAEL! And now there making another one. I just want them to take Transformers seriously for the next film, (which I know they won't).

"Let me first say that I'm not one of those crybaby geeks Michael Bay was moaning about when the movie was still under production. I assume he was referring to those 40 year old hardcore G1 fans (virgins). I couldn't have cared less about Michael Bay staying true to the original story, so long as his adaptation was worth my time. Thus, my complaints have nothing to do with this film's ""originality"". Besides, its not his script.THE BAD: The story was stupid. Is that succinct? I figured not, so please allow me to break it down for you without spoiling the movie. The character development was laughable. There are several Autobots (good guys) in the film who are nothing but a name, a voice and a ""duty"" as described by Optimus. A story is supposed to be driven by characters, not CGI creations. There is one battle scene in which it is difficult to distinguish the Autobots from one another, not to mention from their enemy Deceptacons. Am I supposed to be happy that one robot kicked the other? I don't know what side he's on.Additionally, none of the characters were credible. Anthony Anderson is apparently the world's most brilliant hacker, yet he doesn't seem to act half-intelligent. The Secretary of Defense walks around without body guards. He actually wields a shotgun in one scene (I hope that doesn't spoil anything. Its actually in the trailer). To Michael Bay, characters are nothing more than a name, title and appearance. The plot was laughable. I don't want to give anything away, but let me just say that it lacked the slightest trace of imagination.The dialog was laughable. This follows naturally from the pathetic character development. THE GOOD: If you're looking for a decent comedy, watch the first hour of this film, then walk out.I have to give the lead actor kudos. He did well with the script he was handed.THE NEUTRAL: The perspective needed work. While I agree with Bay's assessment that this film is about the human reaction to these robots, I find that he overcomplicated that reaction. I personally think he would have been better off limiting the perspective to the Transformers, Sam and his hot girl who's name I cannot recall for the life of me. This is certainly Bay's finest work. He's not a bad acting director like George Lucas. I think his flaw is a lack of imagination or vision. He can't see all of the events of this story and put together a meaning. This is why many people have complained ""I didn't feel anything"" after seeing this film.In summation, do not pay to see this in theaters. Wait for the DVD, but make sure you buy handle of Vodka to help the time pass. You'll need it.","Jul 4, 2007",1,/10
"I thought this movie was awesome! So far, I've seen it twice, and I'm about to see it again for the third time. Heck, it was the best movie, in my opinion, this year. It's as original as ""Stargate SG-1""(If you're a ""Stargate SG-1"" fan, then you know why ""Transformers"" is/will be awesome). This movie is action packed, and it's science fiction!!! I'm 33, and I remember when Marvel first released ""Transformers"" in a four limited issue comic book series (I have them, by the way). Then the toys came out. I really felt young again watching this movie. I'm glad they decided to make this movie in our recent times versus attempting to make it in the 1990s. Look what happened to ""Spawn"".Anyways, you have to see it, if you haven't. ""Transformers"" is ""Transformers"", and it was made with the skills and creativity by those who made it. ""Transformers"" is not ""Star Wars"", and it's not ""Stargate SG-1"". Don't try to compare it to anything other then itself.","Jul 18, 2007",10,/10
"In my adolescence, I once thought that THE TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE (1986) was one of the best films ever made. Age and access had not yet tinged my movie-going experience. Such is youth, forever sentimentalizing our early lives and its subjects. Many of us who grew up on these Hasbro heroes still hold them in reverie, regardless of the profound silliness of it all. But we've all been young, and boys will be boys in love with their toys.For followers of the series, how much you love Michael Bay's TRANSFORMERS will depend on how much you have grown up (and probably how many decibels your eardrums can take). It seems natural that many of us who collected toy autobots and decepticons might have had great interest in the fields of science, as the mechanics of how these robots transform required inquiry during our younger years. So if you're like me, watching this movie may not only reveal an on screen battle between good and evil, but also one's own personal battle between nostalgia and common sense.I know that I shouldn't be applying logic against a concept that was never meant to be logical. Optimus Prime, Megatron and their ilk were not meant to be opposing leaders of a mechanical alien race set against a space epic. They're cool toys representing the fanciful idea of having normal everyday vehicles transform into humanoid mechas. That's killing two birds with one stone in toy marketing.The problem is that the level of detail and seriousness the film initially builds up begs us to consider its plausibility. The movie's opening sequence of where a decepticon infiltrates a US military base (apparently in the Middle East) is well-executed and as convincing as can be. Explanations on how these mechas are able to speak English are humorous but (barely) believable. And the initial electronic strategies the decepticons use to hamper US defense systems make sense.But when the deeper questions are asked, the house of cards falls apart. These robots transform to blend into earth's general populace, but why did they ever need to transform in the first place? Was there an evolutionary advantage that morphing gave them on their home world or are they just God's toys? Why do they speak to communicate as they are electronic beings? If they can reach the earth through space, why do they travel slowly as grounded transport? Couldn't they all have chosen aircraft functions to replicate? And why in one inexplicable scene are they reduced to comedic stooges hiding from a kid's parents in his backyard? Surely these and other queries are supposed to be ignored, but my inquisitive side keeps on tugging on my id. If your inner child wins out however, there are worthy sights to behold. The transformers themselves have been bravely redesigned, which is refreshingly the correct choice as opposed to keeping their original forms. Though some characters from the cartoon series will be familiar, the vehicular alter-egos have been totally revamped to fit current tastes (and toy franchising needs). Mecha battles engaged in Los Angeles are at times breathtaking, none more than Starscream's low-flying dogfighting maneuvers. Fans will likely warm to some in-jokes (a decepticon police car motto), a jab at ""My Little Pony"" (a fellow Hasbro franchise), and surely, hearing Peter Cullen's voicing of Prime.Speaking of which, this gloriously authoritative father-figure lacks presence and warmth. Animated characters by their very nature more stylized and symbolic; highlighting their traits to an almost elemental level. How ironic that Optimus Prime in all his CGI glory projects less heroism and gravitas than his hand-drawn version. Perhaps it is our youth that taints our view, plus the all-to realistic detail of the film's special effects makes him look more of a machine and less of a hero (or maybe it's because now we can see his mouth move?). Shia LaBeouf, as the young Sam Witwicky who stumbles onto the robotic conflict, is the only well-rounded character worth following. He keeps it interesting, but can only do so much.From a cinematic view, Michael Bay was born to direct this movie. He just loves toys, as not one of his films to date has had an unexploded vehicle. In filming convincing human dynamics however, he hasn't got a clue, as evidenced in one scene where he tries miserably and awkwardly in getting us to feel bad for an autobot's capture. His methods have deteriorated as he irritatingly refuses to stop using shaky camera movements during conflict, and dozens of slow motion sequences, mistaking disorientation and distraction for a frenzied perspective. For the life of me, I don't understand why he cannot just let the action speak for itself.As you can see, I've grown up a bit too far from my guilelessness to enjoy TRANSFORMERS. I do not disdain this kind of entertainment. Truth be told, its writing is better than I thought it would be, but its fancy façade can't hide its flaws for those who want more substance. I find Prime deserving of better treatment, but considering its source, this might be as good as it gets. So enjoy it if you can. I tried and couldn't.","Jul 1, 2007",5,/10

I stood up and applauded the film when the credits rolled, as did two other people in the theater, because it doesn't disappoint.

"Transformers is a must-see, and not on DVD - in theatres where the full effect can be seen and heard. Flawless CGI, a decent plot, and action throughout makes this a winning formula for all ages.FOR ME I was just amazed at what a good job they have done keeping alive the Transformers legend. I was a lukewarm fan when younger, and this was so much better than the show ever was.FOR KIDS I took my 6 and 8yos to it. I was concerned about the M rating it received in Australia, but after reading comments realised that was an unusual and inappropriate rating. In the end, the main violence/fighting is between the robots, and my kids both loved it. There were no nightmare-inducing scenes, but plenty of memorable funny moments that my kids have kept recreating since. Overall a great experience, especially since one of my kids is named after a Transformer (Jazz!).FOR WIVES I had to drag my wife along to see this movie - she really didn't want to go. In the end she said she was very tired anyway and so could enjoy the sleep. Not a chance! She stayed wide-awake from start to finish and loved the movie. Now I'm easy to please when it comes to this sort of action movie, but my wife always sleeps. The fact she stayed awake AND loved the movie speaks volumes.Really looking forward to a sequel, and many more! There are plenty more characters yet to be reintroduced to a new generation...","Jul 11, 2007",9,/10
Let my start out by saying this movie freakin rocked. The action was top notched the actors were perfect for their roles and this movie was very humorous thanks to a great job from Shia. Basically the plot is a group of soldiers in Iraq are attacked by an unknown highly advanced technological enemy who are after top secret file. Meanwhile Sam a high school student buys his first car after a series of strange events. Optimus Prime and the rest of the autobots were each given a different and great personality. This people who are saying OMG THIS MOVIE SUCKS on the boards but it is really quite awesome so don't take their word for it until you actually see this movie. This was easily better than Spiderman 3 and all the other flops this summer ( which in my opinion has been every movie this summer so far besides this and Live free or die hard).

What I found was marginal animation, terrible everything else. After the first scene this movie just fell apart. The editor must have been drunk, the movie skips from unconnected scene to unconnected scene. There are so many holes in the story line I gave up on the story and just decided to watch the animation. I started to laugh at the movie making rather than the movie itself. There is little room in this movie for acting because of the time spent in cars being transformed into robots, time, after time, after time, after time.

"Michael Bay has outdone himself, and may not be able to do this great until ""Transforers II."" Overall, the movie was pleasing to Transformers fans, and non. I appreciated the use of the ""transforing sound effect"" but not an over use of it. The references to the original 1984 movie were great; ""Autobots, roll out""; Megatron's relationship with Starscream; and to take the cake, when Megatron and Optimus Prime meet, the immortal line, ""One shall stand, and one shall fall."" Peter Cullan as Prime was amazing, and could not have been any other way. This movie was extremely pleasing to me, as I have followed Transforers all of my life. But, what makes this movie pleasing to non-Transforers fans? I'm about to tell you. The special effects in this movie were amazing. If there is anyone out there who likes explosions and giant robots duking it out, or just an old fashioned good versus evil film, this is your movie. The movie was also quite comedic, which was great. The cinematography was excellent, especially in the robot fight sequences. As a devout Transformers fan, and also a movie lover, I rate this movie at 10 out of 10; 10 of 10 in special effects; 10 of 10 in story; 10 of 10 in action; 10 of 10 in directing. I strongly suggest this movie for anyone, and I mean anyone, because it appeals to all interests. ""Autobots, roll out!""","Jul 20, 2007",10,/10
"I'll admit, I had my doubts. Being that I'm younger and only met transformers through Beast Wars, I didn't know much about them. As soon as the video game for this movie came out, however, I was hooked. I went to the theater excited already, because most ads said July 4th, some said the 3rd, and I found a theater on the 2nd. From the opening scene, I was glued. I'm the type of person to seek out CGI errors and jumps, and all the little kinks every movie has. Whether it was the expert special effects or the overbearing fascination with the movie, I don't know, but I could not find anything substantial. This movie stepped it up where many others fell short. This was my ""summer at the movies"". My first of two complaints is that there was not enough close range fighting between transformers, however this is understandable. The second is that I have to wait until 2009 to see Michael Bay's movie adaptation of ""Prince of Persia"".","Jul 2, 2007",9,/10
"When I saw the first trailer which was only a few seconds long, something deep in my soul stirred. An excitement gathered to the point that I almost burst with anticipation......and I was NOT disappointed.The movie was absolutely fantastic! By far, the best sci-fi-meets-action film I have EVER seen. 5 minutes into it I already knew I was going to see it at least 2 more times.Lead character was funny and easy to relate to. It was like being a kid sitting in front of the TV again except now it is as awesome as it should be when you imagined them being real. I will see this again...and so will you!!!!!! Now I'm just waiting for the Thundercats movie!!!!","Jul 19, 2007",10,/10
"This is a terrible film. I can't see how any right-thinking person could say otherwise. It's insultingly lame and convoluted. I wish I had the energy to point out all of its laughable flaws but I don't.And besides, almost every other user comment lists them already.My main reason for posting is to lower the average rating, which has clearly been unfairly manipulated by studio shills.A couple of questions 'cause I need to write 10 lines apparently:Why are the autobots such pussies?What made the studio bosses think we want to watch the autobots acting like idiots and getting their asses kicked? Seriously, I'd love to hear their reasoning on this. What happened to the Australian chick and her 'token' friend?How does IMDb choose its lead comment? Why is the average rating for this film not lower, considering everyone clearly hates it?","Jul 17, 2007",2,/10
"Enough said, because those are the four things this futuristic movie relied upon. Action-filled scenes, Direction, visuals and LaBeouf. Michael Bay, after a box office success with Bad boys 2, makes a comeback with Transformers, a film based on the popular animated series. And let me just say I got what I was looking for, a simple film filled with a bad guy loses good guy wins scenario, and a film filled with heavy special effects. Michael bay directed the film to his best. And one constituent that rose above the rest was LaBeouf's tremendous performance. The Even Stevens star gives a top-notch performance filled with huge laughter, energy and the usual a teenage boy has a crush on a girl story. But above all lies the consistent and exhilarating action in the film along with the personification of the alien robots and the stunning visuals, that had me longing for more.","Dec 19, 2008",8,/10
"I will give the movie this...intense, non-stop action & excellent CG's. That's about it. It would have been a great movie if it was not called Transformers.As a kid growing up in the 80's, I do not think I missed a single episode. Needless to say, I was very disappointed with the movie. It was obvious the writers sold out to GM. Bumblebee was a VW not a camaro, Jazz was a Porche not a Solstice, Optimus was a cabover not a straight nose, Ironhide was a van, not a truck Megatron was a gun not a jet, I don't even know who Barricade and Blackout were, the robot form was nothing like the original, and they didn't have the classic sound when they transformed.In my opinion, if you are going to make a movie based off of an already existing product, don't make up your own version of what it should be like.What's next...Roots with all white actors?","Jul 8, 2007",5,/10
"I grew up a huge fan of the Transformer TV series, the original one in the 80's. I have some of the episodes on cassette and I want to buy the entire series on DVD. That is how much I like the show and it was the best cartoon series of all time in my opinion. The movie Transformers, in my opinion, would make the cartoon proud. It is an absolutely stunning and brilliantly-made film.The special effects of this film are great. The designs and interpretations of the Transformers are incredible, far beyond what I was expecting. The fight scenes are even better! Just imagine two 100-foot tall transformers going at one another! And the Transformer vs. Transformer battles are not just great, but the Transformer vs. Human battles are good too! The effects are so real as well! Not for a second did I think the effects were overdone or ridiculously fake. The special effects of this film are beyond belief and what they do to the Transformer characters. Although most of the Transformers lost their original exoskeleton designs for the movies, I was not displeased with their new exoskeleton designs.Acting is pretty solid in this film. Shia Lebeouf, Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and even Bernie Mac deliver good performances. The thing I like about the movie is that it takes a serious approach to the Transformers. But it still keeps a lot of humor in the movie. And it is not even stupid humor, it is good, solid, funny humor. A lot of it will either come from Shia Lebeouf, Bernie Mac, or the Transformers which I really like.I absolutely loved the music in the film. I felt like I was watching Batman Begins and that was fantastic. The music was terrific, I might even buy the soundtrack. The sound was great as well, just hearing the Transformers transform was terrific. The story is fantastic as well. Some of the most crucial Transformers and Decepticons are put into the movie. The story builds up more and more as it goes. I kept getting more on edge as the movie went on and I like that in a film. I disliked how they handled the story with Sam and his ""girlfriend"" Mikaela. It seemed stupid and unnecessary. Other than that, the story is easy to follow and easy to get drawn into.Finally, the Transformers themselves. I will admit, I was worried about there not being enough original and recognizable Transformers in the film but I was wrong. I do wish they had more with the Transformers in the movie though. The movie seemed to focused on the humans and not enough on the title characters. Other than that, the characters are great. They bring in 5 of the biggest characters as the core group of the Autobots which was wonderful to see. Peter Cullen voices Optimus Prime and all I can say is I think we need to give the guy an award. Lets get him an Oscar nomination, Please. Because whenever I hear him talk, my heart just starts racing. Megatron is voiced wonderfully by Hugo Weaving. You can barely tell it is Weaving because his voice is covered by a metallic voice-over which sounds terrific. I admit, I had a hard time deciphering Bumblebee. Although there is a reason for it, I had a hard time hearing him. I disliked Starscream in the movie. He looked really awkward (like a gorilla) and I was disappointed with his character. I do not want to be a spoiler, so I won't tell you any more Transformers although I would absolutely love to discuss them. One small thing, I wish Cullen would have done the voice of another Transformer in the movie. That is all I am saying!!!!!!!Transformers is more than meets the eye. I was expecting a mediocre movie and I got a terrific movie. One of the best films I have seen this year. And if you think Peter Cullen should get an Oscar nod for his performance as Optimus Prime, make a comment on my ""comment"". Maybe than we can convince the Academy Awards!","Jul 7, 2007",9,/10
"Now while I do admire the 80's film for it's grand score and acting, but that does not make me look past it's countless animation errors, plot holes, continuity errors, and just plain WTF moments. The CGI animation on the transformers was astounding and the action scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. I felt the Sam and Mikela characters were unnecessary, but I loved the army guys as well as Maggie and Glen, as well as Keller. The Transformers themselves were voiced by actors such as Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, Jess Harnell, Robert Foxworth, Reno Wilson, Charlie Alder, Darius McCrary, Jimmie Wood, and Mark Ryan.I do have to say it is a nice film, and has a nice plot and is nicely directed.84/100","Mar 18, 2011",8,/10
"I don't want to spoil the movie for you... but go and see Transformers in the biggest, loudest cinema you can find!I have never been a huge Michael Bay fan before, but after the Premiere last night in Wellington, New Zealand, I am a 'transformed' Michael Bay devotee (you see what I did there). God bless you Michael Bay. This film is fast-paced, laugh-out-loud funny and the special FX are mind blowing! I very much doubt that you will be be disappointed. The humor works especially well and has a real improvised tone to it. The FX really are outstanding. The digital artists at ILM deserve all the praise in the world for this film. The story... well the story is simple and clear, but who really cares when a spectacle such as Optimus Prime is kicking serious ass in front of you! I had tears in my eyes when he first transformed. Simply outstanding!-Rich","Jun 27, 2007",10,/10
The cons - This may be the most boring show I have seen in a great long while. Apparently the directors know nothing about adaptation and I don't mean a rewrite - I mean that if you hear the same sound or see the same action over and over and over... eventually you simply tune out and don't hear or see it. As far as the writing goes I guess they saved a great deal of money on writers because there was little dialog to follow even when you could hear it over the constant loud explosions.The pros - The graphics were colorful. They would have made nice posters for a kids room. What dialog there was could be amusing. The filming was well done and the special effects were up to pare. Of course when that is all there is to the movie they certainly should be decent. I liked the small transformer that turned into a humping dog at one point. That was the height of the humor of the movie.,"Aug 15, 2010",5,/10
"The movie, was fantastic. I was waiting for a whole year for it's release and it was definitely worth the wait. Best movie of the summer and last summer as well. I would recommend this movie for people who like science fiction, or mech related stories. I actually would recommend this film to anyone. The acting was top notch, the lines were creative, both the director and producer did a good job at making this movie. The moment I saw that Micheal Bay was directing, I knew it was going to be a hit, then I saw that Spielberg was going to Produce, then it was official. As far as a sequel goes, I don't know if that would be a smart move. Most sequels don't do justice and this movie would be hard to live up to. 10-must see in the theater, show to others, rent and own. 9-must see in the theater, rent, and own. 8-could see in theaters, rent. 7-Rent it 6-watch it for free on hbo or TV 6 or less, don't bother","Jul 11, 2007",10,/10

The graphics were awesome and really made you want to keep your eyes open so you wouldn't miss a thing. The length was perfect, not too long, not too short.

"Frankly, I am not a fan of SCi-Fi movie genre, but this movie comes as a big surprise. This is not a typical Sci-Fi movie, it is not even a serious action movie and is packed with so much comedy and humor( not the cheap ones that we see in American Pie etc etc). The special effects were simply incredible (debatable as the best ever).The robots were great and the action sequences among them is just perfect. The way the robots turned themselves into Chevy Camaro and GMC Trucks is so well etched out. As for the actors, Shia LaBeouf is the perfect cast(Hollywoods future) for the lead role. He is really comic. And then his opposite sexy Megan Fox may not be that good an actress but certainly adds a package of glamor. The rest of the cast including Tyresse, Josh Duhamel, Racheal Taylor and Jon Voight do not disappoint either. The movie looks far more expensive than just $147m and could not understand how Spiderman could cost more than this one. Okay this may not be the best ever but certainly its way better than Spiderman 3, Pirates of the Caribbean- At World's End. It certainly was a relief for me as the movie that i watched before this one in the theater was the extremely pathetic EVAN ALMIGHTY.","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10
"Warning: this is a review written by a grudgy, nearly 40-year old who grew up with Transformers in the 1980's.The 2007 original is the first and last movie I watched from the infamous ""Bayformers"" series. I went to the theatre with enthusiasm, finally a live-action Transformers movie! Thought that, with modern CGI, it would have been plain simple to render our beloved Cybertronian heroes and villains on screen. Huge dispappointment when I saw that all robots had been turned into incomprehensible walking masses of metal junk. The Decepticons especially had nothing at all of the characters from the cartoon and comics. At least, the Autobots had the names of the historical characters, while the 'cons were completely invented out of the blue, save for Megatron and Starscream.The worst part about this movie, and all its disgraceful sequels, is that the main characters are not the Transformers themselves, but their human allies! US soldiers blowing up Decepticons with human military weapons!? Excuse me!? The leading topic of the whole Transformers franchise always was that Cybertronians are so advanced and powerful that humans are helpless again them. Only the Autobots can stop the Decepticons, we all know that. One of the most memorable episodes of the 1980's cartoons shows the whole Decepticon air squad obliterating US aviation. ""Even Earth's best pilots can't anything against us"", said Megatron after the memorable sequence. Who needs the Autobot if a single marine soldier can destroy a Decepticon by shootig a rocket launcher in his ""balls""?Enough said. It's now 2019, and fortunately the Bayformers franchise came to an end. Hopefully, if a reboot will be done in the next decade, it will be with good ol' 1980's characters for us old men.","Jul 31, 2019",1,/10

"All right, hands down, in my opinion, this was the best action movie I have seen so far. I sat in the theater speechless, always anxious to see what was next. I loved loved LOVED it, but of course, it had its low points. The fighting between the robots were near to perfection (although very unrealistic when dealing with reactions of citizens and Sam's parents) and were possibly the best parts in the movie. You gotta love those slow-motion transforming parts. However, I absolutely hated the dialog of the robots. They said some pretty cheesy and unnecessary things. I wasn't feeling their voices either but I guess that was as good as it can get. And, I'm starting to warm up to Shia. I despised his role in the Disney series Even Stevens, but seeing his role in Disturbia and now Transformers, I think he will become or already is a great actor. Now about Megan Fox... she's hot. Extremely hot. But I walked in the theaters not expecting much from her character and as soon as I saw the first scene she was in, I knew I was right. She seldom did much to help and she's not a very good actress. She seems like a total girly girl even though she knew a lot about trucks. I don't know about you, but if I was dragged involuntarily to deal with massive destructive robots, I'd be screaming my ass off and not just tragically stare at the scary robots. There were some parts that confused me when I would just be like WTF ARE THEY SAYING but this movie is all about action and Michael Bay pretty much nailed it. And I was expecting Megatron's defeat to be much more... action-y. Oh well. As long as there's a sequel, I ain't complaining. Good job, Michael Bay. 9/10 for me.","Jul 8, 2007",9,/10
"Transformers was what I wanted and hoped it would be! I prayed that this franchise would not get ruined by Hollywood like so many others before it. The movie is fun! That is all I can say. Transformers doesn't take itself to seriously. It knows it is a movie about 30 foot tall robots fighting it out, and how crazy that would seem to us if it really happened! With this in mind, the movie is full of witty jokes about the situation. This only ads to the enjoyment of the movie. If you think, ""The Transformers need to be serious!"" Well, if you feel it's too kiddy while you watch it, wait for the ending 45 minutes. You will be happy! The story line was very good I thought. Simple and to the point. There is plenty more to come! (keep reading).The CG was AMAZING! I found myself during one scene looking at what I really thought were two huge robots beating the crap out of each other. It looked so REAL! This is what great CG looks like and is where it is going! I got goose-bumps more than 10 times through out the movie! I wanted to get up and cheer for the Autobots! This is what a great movie is about! From action, adventure, science fiction, comedy, and a great ""we've only just begun"" ending, to the underlying tones of love and friendship, Transformers delivered on all levels!I am very happy with this movie!!","Jul 2, 2007",10,/10

"Thank you for ruining one of my favorite cartoon shows, Michael Bay. Transformers is not a terrible movie, but it is not good either. Shia LeBeouf is the lone bright spot in a film that drags, has multiple extraneous plot lines (the computer programmers, Sector 7, the Army unit, etc.), and many unnecessary attempts at humor. Bernie Mac has a hilarious cameo at the beginning as a used car salesman, but Anthony Anderson's cameo as a computer hacker is annoying and pointless. Similarly, the phenomenal John Turturro is forced to play an irritating G-man who does not contribute anything the plot of the film, but attempts to conjure cheap laughs instead. The focus of the movie should have been on plot rather than making it a film that everyone can somewhat enjoy.My biggest gripe, however, is the lack of character development for the Autobots (the good transformers) and Decepticons (the evil transformers). Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots, is the only robot with any significant screen-time besides Bumblebee, who is a silent Camaro for most of the film. The transformers should have been the stars of the movie, not the human characters who help them. Characters like Starscream, Bumblebee, Hot Rod (who's not even in the film despite being the #2 Autobot), Jazz, Soundwave, Frenzy, etc. are integral parts of the TV series and cartoon movie, yet they are barely in the film and nearly impossible to tell apart in the battle scenes. Also, Megatron is only in the film for a few minutes and turns into an airplane rather than the giant gun that he is supposed to be. How can the antagonist only be in the film for the last scene? To top off night of epic disappointment, there was no Stan Bush song on the soundtrack. Whos is Stan Bush you say? Only the musical god who rocked our socks off with ""Dare"" and ""The Touch"" in the original film. Bay opted for Linkin Park instead...F+ for that decision. There was also no mention of energon cubes, the matrix of leadership, or Unicron. Granted, only hardcore fans know what I'm talking about, but many of the 20-somthings who went to see this movie grew up watching the show and were probably as disappointed as I was with the lack of effort to stay true to the show.While the visual effects are stunning, the plot wanders like lost child at the fair and the transformers are presented as little more than advanced machines. For anyone who truly enjoyed the cartoon show and movie, avoid this film.","Jul 3, 2007",5,/10
"I'm a TF fan from the beginning. I remember the first episodes of Transformers, and have followed them throughout every iteration: the good, the bad, the ugly...I went to see the original Transformers The Movie back in the 80's. With that being said, when I first heard they were doing the live action version, I was 10 years old again with the amount of excitement I had (I'm 30 now).Last night I got to see the Sneak Preview, and let me tell you...I waited 20 years for this..........and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT.Any little nit-picky stuff that fans might have brought up (like flames on Optimus, or Megatron being redesigned, or anything else, for that matter) all goes out the window with the very first sequence. I literally found myself on the edge of my seat with my head resting on my hands, bouncing like a kid with excitement because this movie was THAT FUN. The audience cheered at the first appearance of Optimus; the reaction to the entire movie was incredible, and at the end EVERYONE CHEERED.Michael Bay came off in one of his interviews as being a bit arrogant. You know what? He had a right to be. He knew EXACTLY what he'd done...and it was incredible.THIS IS WHAT SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS SHOULD BE.GO SEE IT.","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10
"No SpoilersGutted, 100% gutted. Gutted at the fact I have to wait another 23 days before I can watch this again. OMFG this is the best movie I have ever seen ever. Godfather II, suck my balls. Cassablanca, go hide in the corner you no good pile of horse manure. Star Wars, Bet you wish you were made in 2007 with Michael Bay directing!OK - It was in English which was great (saw it in Norway), apart from a few times the transformers spoke to each other in cybertronian, with Norwegian subtitles. Never mind, the crowd laughed and I can wait to see what these 5 or 6 lines I missed were.My Review.....Non stop action. And them some. I know you can't start a sentence with and, but never mind, I'm in far too good a mood to worry about crap like that. In fact, my 30 years on this planet may just have been a build up to those last 2 hours. Explosions, fighting, explosions, sexy ladies, explosions, some big f'n robots and some more explosions. Oh yea, this might also be one of the funniest movies I have seen for a long time.Plot wise, good robots, bad robots, humans in between and they're all searching for something. Which they find as you'd expect and everyone fights over it. That's about it really. But, my God! I am still shaking with excitement, it's just pure carnage from start to finish. I cheered a few times while watching this, as did the rest of the audience. We clapped in unison, laughed in unison and occasionally there were about 120 people saying oooooo and aaaaaaaa in unison. Bay has done a fantastic job with this. I was expecting a no brainer movie and I got it. He did me proud (so I guess I don't have to hunt him down to kill him now Laughing) and he did it with an extra loud bang.Will kids love this movie? Yup Will 30yo's love this movie? Yup (and then some) Will older people love this movie? - To be honest, I am not sure that they all will. It's so fast paced and loud that I can imagine some old dear being taken out of the cinema with a cardiac condition. But she will probably have a smile on her face....There was a hell of a lot of in jokes, references to other movies, actors who have Transformers connections and in general it is a geek fest. I won't spoil it for you. I will probably have to watch it 2 or 3 times to pick up on them all.The acting.If you've read the Empire review, you'll see that they single out Le Beouf for praise. He deserves this. He was fantastic. His comic timing helped make this movie and had someone like Tom Cruise, Bruce Willis, Tom Hanks (when they were younger) played this part the movie may not have worked. Le Beouf manages to bring the movie down to earth and keep it there. It's so real what he says and does and I can totally emphasise with his character, as will most geeks like us! comparisons to woody Allen - I say give it time but he can do it. Megan looked fantastic and was actually very good on screen. She got more time then she ever gets in Hope and Faith and she will turn out to be a big star. Josh Duhamel was very likable and it was always fun when he was up there. The rest of the cast also did a good job with no real notable bad turns.So, as you may have gathered I liked this movie a hell of a lot but do I have any complaints. Yup, I do. There is not enough screen time for some of the Transformers. I guess that with sequels in mind they will get more eventually, I guess as it's the ""introduction"" movie we should have expected that. Also the way that some of the humans, (especially government ones) react to some situations is almost comical. I think that it's meant to be that way but some gain no respect for this. They don't give any indication that they could do their job if if weren't for the smart kids running around helping them.Other than that. Brilliant.10/10I am sorry if this is was a bit disjointed as a review but I am very excited and my blood is still pumping.","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10
"Overall, a great action movie. But it could've been so much more.As a film, it had everything that people new to Transformers would like. Action, a bit of comedy and a bit of romance with Hollywood A Grade special effects.But if you knew the storyline of the original Transformers... you'd realize one thing... The Autobots and Decepticons are the main characters. Hence, the reason for my title, as this film is indeed Independence day, mixed with some Alien Vs Predator action. I find it really hard to enjoy an adapted film when it doesn't follow it's source material.Michael Bay does a good job with telling the action. But since I'm looking at the film in a director's point of view, action and adventure isn't enough. Telling a story is important. Unfortunately, the story is lacking in this film. It is very lenient and even though there was 3 Hours to tell the story, there wasn't much character development, as there were too many parallel story lines and characters.Robot design as great and realistic. Megatron is as cool as he should be. But screen time for these characters... hhhmmm...I really do hope that the sequel will be much better. I hope that it will be the Judgement Day of Transformers as it was for Terminator. What was great about Terminator 2 was it's deep storyline, focusing on the Terminator and the mythology.I'm guessing this film was to introduce to the entire world of Transformers. And I really wish that in T2, they will have more elements from the animation which made it such a hit. As the real protagonists are meant to be the Cybertronians themselves.","Jun 28, 2007",8,/10

"Films like Transformers have just lost all sense of reality. I know sci-fi cannot be 100% realistic, but there has to be a limit. Transformers just goes on and on for over 2 hours, action scene after action scene. Sure, the special effects are great, although a little annoying at times as it's a little too in your face and close-up. The plot is really feeble, which is why I guess they had to pack it so full of action. I get the feeling that Hollywood is continuously trying to out-do itself, and with films like this has forgotten the importance of a convincing storyline and a semblance of reality! As I watched I just got the feeling that nobody of any importance was ever going to die, whether the transformers or the actors, no matter how far they were thrown are how hard they were hit, despite buildings falling all around them. To add to the disappointment, we were treated to some terribly cringe worthy lines from some of the transformers towards the end. I think films like Transformers are simply an insult to the public's intelligence, but judging by some of the reviews here I'm perhaps living on another planet.","Aug 5, 2008",4,/10
"I went into this movie with extremely high expectations, being that I'm a huge fan. Let me just say it was even better that I could have imagined. Everything about this movie is pure entertainment, and all out fun! Many criticise Michael Bay for his over the top extravagance when it comes to his movies. Suffice to say, Transformers is not the sort of franchise that would benefit from a softly softly approach to the film. Bay was definitely the best choice to direct, as he has produced some of the most jaw droppingly amazing action sequences ever seen. What struck me the most was the how believable the interaction was between the Transformers and the humans (well, as believable as a 20 metre tall alien robot can be). There is plenty of humour and a pleasing amount of cheesiness present throughout, which makes for an extremely entertaining total package. I can't recommend Transformers highly enough, and have no hesitation in giving it 10/10","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10

"These days it seems every move that comes out, whether it's an epic like ""The Departed"" or a complete piece of crap like ""Transformers"", gets an average score of 8.You people who don't know a good movie from pure junk should find another website. This one is for serious movie watchers.Transformers was stupid, infantile, predictable and boring. The only relatively entertaining scene was at the kid's house with the transforms hiding all over the place. Not even the special effects/animation was any good. Please people. If you thought Transformers was a good movie, go find another website to post your opinions.","Jul 24, 2007",1,/10
"I can't begin to describe the awesomeness contained in this movie. I went into the theatre a little apprehensive, feeling that Michael Bay wouldn't do the series justice. I was also relieved that Optimus Prime wasn't a lawnmower as had been previously thought. Apprehensive as I was, this movie did not fail on any conceivable level. Every thing that could have been done right was done right. Amazing CGI, great actors, great everything! In fact, it was so good, I'm already making plans to see it tomorrow and the end of the week. If you go to this movie and are disappointed, you will possibly be the only person on earth to feel that way. Most human brains can't process the amount of awesomeness in this movie. Go see it. Love it. See it again. You won't be disappointed, guaranteed.","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10
"Steven Spielberg was right. ""Transformers"" is a great fit for Michael Bay. The king of action, flashy effects, macho posturing, cornball humor and over-stylized photography should have been doing cartoon adaptations from the beginning. What seemed cheesy in ""The Island"" and over the top in ""Pearl Harbor"" mostly works in ""Transformers."" Much of it has to do with Shia Labouf's likability, a quick-paced and often-funny script and amazing special effects.Of course, the script doesn't offer much in the way of story (good robots plus bad robots equal big explosions). But it does give us some great action set pieces and one truly great Spielbergian sequence right in the middle of the film. Take a few friendly aliens, throw them in a boy's backyard, hide them from the parents and fend off the men in black, and you've got ""Close Encounters"" meets ""E.T."" meets ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park."" And Bay pulls it off with truly funny results.From that point on, however, it's all action. And that may be the film's biggest weakness... or greatest asset, depending on your perspective. Characters fall by the wayside, big story set-ups get cursory finales, and one particular death scene is rushed and quickly forgotten (especially strange for a director who loves dramatic music and slow motion photography).Most importantly, though, the robots are AWESOME. And THIS is why Spielberg hired Bay. The effects are real. The Autobots and Decepticons lumber, fly, battle, roar and smash. When they fight, you can feel the metal crunching, and when they fall, the ground shudders. But the frenetic fight choreography is both frustrating and exciting. Sometimes the film is way too cluttered with tangled robot arms and weapons, even if the chaos does add a real-world dimension to the effects' believability.Anyway, ""Transformers"" is two hours of good looking people shooting at cars and robots, running away from cars and robots, and watching cars and robots explode. And it's pure entertainment.Best part: check out the producers' ""f**k you"" to Volkswagen near the beginning of the film. Bernie Mac makes the scene.","Jun 28, 2007",8,/10
"After giving us The Rock,Armageddon,Bad Boys I & II and The Island,Michael Bay surprises again with his latest ""artwork"" Transformers.Let's face it,Bay is an action director.His movies cannot be compared to masterpieces like the Godfather,but only to other action movies.And believe me,he is effectively good in creating action movies. He has proved that nobody makes them as good and thrilling as him.So,who cares if the movie is not faithful to the 80s cartoon?No movie is 100% faithful to its source.That is a fact.Within 2+ hours,Bay manages to leave us stunned and breathless as we watch the amazing effort he put to create this movie.The CGI,like always,is at its best,much like the action sequences. The Autobots and the Decepticons finally come to life in this movie and they are realistic enough,given the genre of the movie.The cast is great,with shining performances from Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox in the main roles. Also,if you watch many movies(hard not to,this is IMDb!)you will recognize many actors in the supporting cast. Perhaps its the first time Bay utilizes such a big cast.Now,any mature viewer,who is willing to pay the ticket fee,surely knows that beneath the big,flashy explosions,beneath the fast car races and the big robot battles,Transformers is another unreal,all-American,action blockbuster. There really is no need to criticize this movie.For what it is,it succeeds.I had doubts when I first saw that Michael Bay was going to direct this movie.I thought it would have been another animation/3D movie like many others.What Bay gave me,pleasantly enough,was much much more.So,my final advice would be:Forget All the Physics you Learned at School,Forget What You Know,Forget Who You Are,Go,see this movie and be Trans-formed!","Jun 28, 2007",8,/10
"To be honest everyone i saw this movie yesterday with friends. I give it a five for a couple reasons. 1st Micheal bay is really in touch with todays trends example shai wears a strokes shirt wears vans the language he is very in touch. but that also plays against him i thought some dialogue was forced like the talk on masterbation. Also the story was not good and some shots the camera was just to shaky. But i enjoyed the hot girls megan fox racheal taylor, but when i watched this movie did I really care about the world fight no. IT was also to dramatic all Micheal bay movies are. Plu s it was to long. This movie is definitely the Mcdonalds of movie making. Hey I like Mcdonalds too. Big budget big promotion you can go see with friends or family entertaining none the less but any more special then Micheal bays last movie no, and will his next movie be anymore special then this no.Take away the transformers and this movie would be nothing will i rent it no watch it again no but i had fun watching it and an enjoyable time with friends.P.S. Two big complaints with this movie I wish it would have been only an hour and a half I don't need 21/2 hours of tranformers and anyone trying to hang out with friends or have family time probably does not want to donate that much time to a movie. By the time the climax came around i was falling asleep. I did not care about the dramatic battle i had been watching for two hours already and the theater was dark and the movie was not that entertaining. second less from optimus prime every time he opened his mouth he spoke garbage.","Jul 6, 2007",4,/10
"Although I never am a fan of transformers although have seen a few episodes really went in to this movie with high expectations. The movie really delivers what it is meant to be. Although the storyline is really simple and a teen comedy is thrown in there but the CGI and sound effects make up for it. The way they portrayed the transformers was really very cool. can't wait to see the sequel which also includes UNICORN.If I am to summarize the movieThe plus points are Shia LaBeof, Good Humour, Sound and CGI The Minus points are Megan Fox, The irritating parents and the way the US Defense s portrayed in this movie","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10
"Really, whatever awe the SFX might cause, this reflects what Hollywood thinks of the public, and how easily the public rewards the brainlessness with which it is treated. Pathetic new low for Jon Voight and John Turturro ""performances"".The studio, producers, Hasbro, the ""director"", and cast must have been thinking of all the money they would make, so they played ""safe"". Why risk the franchise with a more intelligent and adventurous movie? They just chose cheap, C-rate actors, and an idiotic plot with cheesy lines. Little wonder that striking writers complain, in part, that the movie and TV industry only demands cheap crap for unthinking public, to just squeeze their money out. Thinking people seem to be dangerous (reminds me of the USSR).Pitifully, the mainstream public will just reward these resource-and-opportunity waster ""moviemakers"". People will smile and swing happy, salivating tongues. Didn't Batman Begins set a precedent on how you can make a great movie and ""restart"" a franchise that appeared to have been killed by their own greedy owners in the 80's and 90's? Are we sinking back to the idiotic era of Hollywood?","Feb 2, 2008",2,/10
"I loved this movie. This is what summer popcorn movies should be like. Fun. I'm looking forward to seeing this on DVD and looking forward to seeing a sequel. Michael Bay has done this movie justice. I grew up playing with the toys when I was a kid. When I heard this was going to be done into a full blown live action movie I was skeptical, till I heard Steven Spielburg was producing it. Then when I heard Bay was directing it I figured that if anyone can do it to it's most chaotic he would definitely be the guy. No one can blow things up on film like he can. The actors were right on. Shai or how ever you spell his name was great in the movie. So was Megan Fox, that girl was perfect and really good to look at as well. I'm never been a fan of Tyrese, but he was pretty good in this and Josh Duhmmal was good as always. Let me say this, Optimus Prime is just one bad ass good robot.","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10
"Transformers, it's a movie that everybody has been very negative about ever since it was first announced. Once you see the movie, you'll find yourself enjoying it on every possible level. It's a lot of fun to watch. It's not a intellectual movie, it's not thought-provoking or deep. That's not the point, the point of the movie is to be complete 100% fun and enjoyment. The highlight of the film is Peter Cullen, who voices Optimus Prime and also does a voice-over for the very beginning of the film. He has a booming heroic voice that will send chills up and down your spine. The movies CGI is incredible, the jokes are not particularly fresh or new, but they are a lot of fun. You'll find yourself laughing throughout the film. There are a lot of moments to cheer during the movie. Whether you are new to Transformers or are a total G1 fanatic, you'll love this movie. The only way you won't enjoy this movie is if you enter the movie expecting it to be bad. In any case, you will leave completely entertained and blown away, because after this film Hollywood will be hard-pressed to make anything bigger.","Jul 5, 2007",10,/10
"I have read countless reviews on the Transformers movie and I have to say some of them are outright ridiculous. What did most of you expect when you went into the movie theater? Did you think you were going to see a movie with a phenomenal storyline? Well it's a Michael Bay movie so you know that is off the menu right off the bat. Did you think you were going to see the most stellar acting to date? Once again: it's a Michael Bay movie. However, because it did not have either of the two above mentioned aspects does not make this a horrible movie as many have gone on the record saying. The special effects were more than satisfying and the fight scenes were some of the best eye candy ever to be placed into a movie.I am sure I will receive umpteen messages about how I am off base with my opinion but Michael Bay delivered exactly what we should have expected and yet people still find it necessary to think this was an atrocious movie. Tell me what exactly happened in the movie that made it terrible? Did anything occur that would be out of the ordinary for a blockbuster summer movie? Transformers delivered in the one area it needed to: It brought the robots to life in front of our eyes and that may have been the sole purpose of the movie. If you didn't like it that's really too bad for you. So here is an idea for everyone who absolutely hated the movie. The next time there is a summer blockbuster throw out all expectations. To expect will only leave you disappointed. Instead going into the movie and just take it for what it's worth. This movie was not meant to wow us with amazing acting or a storyline for the ages. Instead it was a special effects monster and that is exactly how it should be judged. If you did not like the way the robots looked, moved, or fought then I have to say there truly is no pleasing a fan with that though process. In the end the idea of the Transformers is what put your butt in the theater yet so many of you decided to complain about a movie that will happen once in a lifetime. By the way, I will watch part 2.","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10
"Let's be honest, people. If you are like me, you are perfectly capable of turning off your brain and enjoying a good action romp. Live Free or Die Hard was a good example of this, although it was smarter than most people give it credit for. This piece of garbage, however, featured probably the best special effects ever seen in a movie, with no emotional subtext to make you care about any of it.The opportunities for character development are wasted on childish drivel. There were more intelligent adult themes in the original cartoon than this, and that's not saying very much (even though I am a die hard G1 Transformers fan). If you don't care about the characters, you don't care about the action sequences. Incidentally, the action featured so many quick cuts and rapid camera motion that it was really hard to enjoy them.There were a few funny jokes in the movie, and a lot more bad ones. All of the acting was terrible, although Shia and the people who played his parents did a halfway decent job. The plot was mediocre, but bogged down by terrible dialogue and directing. Michael Bay did what I expected him to do, which was to waste a wonderful opportunity to make an engaging action spectacular.The biggest crime for me was the characterization of all of the Transformers. No Starscream-Megatron rivalry at all (except for one throw-away line). No personality at all, in fact, for the Decepticons. Ironhide was the only good Autobot personality while the rest, including Optimus, just aroused no feeling in me, and the Jazz character was just racist IMO (Scatman Crothers did a much better version of Jazz in the original series). I didn't give a damn who won the battle because I didn't know any of these undeveloped characters.In the 1986 film, people were crying their eyes out in the theater at some points (no spoilers here because this is the film all of you should see if you care about Transformers). There's nothing to care about here except the really cool transformations and a few jokes. That's it and nothing more at all. I am so unbelievably disappointed.","Jul 7, 2007",3,/10

"Really just a tremendous waste of time. Most of the film is listening to the main character whine about his car and his not having a girlfriend. The autobots are portrayed as stupid (they didn't know that they shouldn't trample on people's houses). What little action there is is brief and unrealistic, even for a movie about giant transforming robots. Most of the Decepticons aren't even given names and don't speak English for some reason. The film tries to pass off Kanji as ""alien symbols."" Everybody sort of forgets that nobody killed Starscream at the end of the film. He blew up a plane and disappeared. The jokes are absolutely painful, and the only person who can act is Jon Voight. Come to think of it, Jon Voight (the actor, not his character) is a pretty cool guy.","Jul 11, 2007",3,/10

"I am a long standing fan of the transformers action cartoon series. This was an adrenaline rush from the start and the entire special effects were the best I have seen from any movie to date. The characters all came back to me exactly I remembered them especially Optimus Prime. I may be in my 40's but I feel 13 again. I am not into cars or trucks, at least not until I saw this movie. Everything in the plot was well thought out and Michael Bay is a leader in the special effects genre. The Action scenes kept my eyes all over the screen every minute. Everyone was clapping and laughing during several scenes of the movie. All the characters came back to life and meant as much to me as they had in the television series. I am not into the cool cars or trucks but I do absolutely want the entire collection of Auto Bots on my nightstand. Go see it!!!!!!","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10
I am still trying to catch my breathe five hours after we just saw the movie. What a wild ride. They did an outstanding job creating the Transformers. I was hoping that they would do more slow motion shots of the machines transforming themselves. The audio was great as well. I never knew there were so many Transformers fans out there until we were at this movie. I can only remember one other time when people cheered throughout the movie but this is the first movie everyone stood cheering at the end. The movie was well worth it. I liked the job that the two main teenage actors did. I see great things coming from them in the future.,"Jul 4, 2007",10,/10
"The Transformers movie is not in my mind a success. There is a potentially cool, fun movie in here but director Michael 'Monkey with a camera' Bay and the writers seriously dropped the ball. The movie starts out okay with the scenes of the soldiers encountering the Transformers is the desert and the introductions to the teen characters aren't too annoying. After this promising introduction things go nowhere fast. There is far too little Transformer action on screen for the first two thirds of the movie- what we do get is cool but there is too much lame filler material with the teenage humans that just goes on and on. Most of it is lame lowest common denominator attempts at comedy such as the whole masturbation scene with Sam Witwicky's parents, the cowardly hacker and the government spook played by poor John Turturro. The whole slapstick sequence with the Transformers hiding from Sam's parents is just painfully unfunny. Sadly, it is one of the few sequences where we get to see the Transformers in action without it being spoiled with shaky-cam. When all the Transformers have actually arrived on earth, well over half way into the movie and we finally get to see what we paid to big robots beating the tar out of each other it is ruined by the editing and camera work. Yes that bane of modern action movies the shaky cam and the overly frenetic editing of Michael Bay make it really hard to see what the hell is going on up on the screen. These scenes look like they're amazing and should be tremendous fun. The CGI is excellent, the Transformers look solid and interact with the real world very well- almost real and the fight scenes show a lot of imagination and creativity  the stuff on the freeway, Transformers going through buildings. However, it is barely possible to work out what is going on screen or even what Transformers you are even looking at as they pummel each other. I wasn't expecting much from this movie- all I wanted was cool scenes of giant robots transforming and beating the crap out each other, I wasn't worried too much about plot or anything like that (How much plot can you expect from a movie based on a kid's cartoon from the eighties designed to sell toys) but they managed to screw it up. If they had lopped of about 30-40 minutes of the running time, mostly the lame comedic padding from the first half and actually shot the battle scenes in a halfway competent fashion this could have been a pretty cool movie. (Chauvinist moment- Despite the great CGI I would have to say the best visual effects shots are those lingering pans of Megan Fox when she is trying to fix Bumblebee).","Jul 7, 2007",4,/10
"For people that wondering what type of movie this is, it's Action Fiction scene movie of good versus evil with lot of superb acting. I'm an 30 year old guy ...and about 20 years ago when i was around 10 ..i liked to watch their cartoon and playing with some of their toys...not a typical fanboys..just following the trend and it slowly just faded away when i grow up,..and now in 2007 it remind me in some short of past memory of my imagination that telling me that this things finally comes alive in superb multi million CGI at big screen..it might be cool to check out but heck it's a kid's movie and i'm an grown up, so for short.. before watching this movie i was all so pretty sceptical thinking that it would be a very very childish movie...boy was i wrong...!, My girlfriend even think that it might be a B type of stupid movie(before seeing the trailers and specially the movie), after i show her the trailer/preview..she's saying that we got to watch this!, and then there we were watching it at after midnight show on July 2,late Monday night 12:20am Tuesday morning at Palm Casino Brendan Imax Theatre...for me it surpasses even further of my expectation(I said that out loud..really), even my girlfriend that don't have any idea of what the heck Transformers is ""got blow'n away"" by this movie. So as i can say Congratulation to Michael Bay, and the producer Steven Spielberg they did an awesome job with this non stop action fiction movie, CGI and acting was just superb (specially Shia), it's really a movie that you and hole family fun to watch...just remember it's PG-13 so leave 8 and 10 at home, if you're a fanboys i promise you that you'll feel emotional(From the character development of the autobots crew with sam and mikaela)...Enjoy the movie and you will..","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10

It's cheaper and healthier. Not to mention that it might allow them to see something better than this!Most of the movie looks like a computer game, it's blatantly obvious a large chunk of the budget went for special effects. Pity, because it didn't leave much for the script, actors and everything else.The characters are god awful, acting is atrocious, I don't think there is a story line really, but I'm afraid I'll damage my brain if I see this again so I can't be sure.I can only conclude that most of the voters here are lobotomized or children... or both!","Oct 8, 2007",1,/10

"that this would be a great movie. I just walked around the mall and decided to go for for a movie, it was die hard against transformers. Since I have seen enough of baldy Bruce, I thought I would give it a try. Ticket prices in Thailand are as low as 5 USD so I thought, I might just walk out of it if it turns out crap, as I honestly expected. I did not like the cartoon series, so I thought I was a question of minutes until I got annoyed. But hey, the story rocked, and it really had likable characters. The specials were great. I have to say that I liked the young boy/girl (especially Shia LaBeouf who was great) story and the 'good' Transformers, but I did not really like the 'good' or 'bad' army guys story. Sorry Josh Duhamel was a miscast, totally forgettable. Also Tyrese Gibson was nothing special, we know that he can't act. If you take the 'good soldier guys' as side show, yeah, they might not disturb too much. John Turturro was alright, but I liked Jon Voight! as the defence secretary. All in all a very pleasant surprise, I might go see it again tomorrow.","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"""It's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good, and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset"". This is what Roger Ebert wrote in his review of Transformers, Michael Bay's summer blockbuster based on an '80s cartoon series, stating that after a succession of mediocre films (Pearl Harbor being the climax) Jerry Bruckheimer's former protégé finally got it right with an action film that works because it doesn't take itself seriously. That's exactly how the movie should be approached: the minute someone starts questioning the script's plausibility instead of praising the great humor, there's nothing left to do.That the concept is, in Ebert's words, ""preposterous"", is evident from the very beginning: a group of American soldiers stationed in Quatar are suddenly attacked by an unidentified, lethal machine, and a few hours later several top secret files are stolen from the Air Force One's mainframe, prompting the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight) to summon the best signal analysts in the country in order to understand what they are dealing with. Unfortunately, the enemy is neither Chinese nor Russian: the bad guys are Decepticons, alien robots who are able to transform into normal vehicles and therefore ""live"" among us unseen (their home-planet, Cybertron, was destroyed during a war). These droids have a double mission: firstly, they must find their leader, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving), who disappeared while looking for the Allstar, a mysterious, powerful cube; secondly, they have to retrieve that cube, which will enable them to turn every machine on Earth into a weapon and conquer our planet with no difficulty at all. They are, however, not the only ones seeking the Cube: the Autobots, another Cybertron race led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen, who also played the role in the cartoon show), are after the Allstar as well, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), a teenager whose grandfather somehow figured out the mysterious object's location, is on their side.The director originally turned down the film, calling it a ""stupid toy movie"", only to realize he had said the same thing regarding Raiders of the Lost Ark over twenty years ago and subsequently change his mind. And even though Bay is no Steven Spielberg (who coincidentally is the executive producer of this movie) and LaBeouf, as likable as he gets, is no Harrison Ford, Transformers is a genuinely enjoyable ride. Why? Because Bay, having realized some stories cannot be handled seriously (which is the mistake he made on his previous works), delivers his latest blockbuster exactly as it is meant to be: very loud, dumb, unpretentious and, most of all, funny. Rather than playing it straight, he focuses on the comedy that emerges from the film's far-fetched scenario: Sam's laughable yet realistic attempts to seduce his friend Mikaela (Megan Fox), his reaction to the discovery that his new car is actually an Autobot, a hilarious conversation with his parents concerning what he was doing alone in his room with the door locked (unmissable). Not all the laughs come from the leading man, mind: the supporting players contribute a lot to make the movie one of the most ridiculously entertaining of the year, particularly John Turturro as the uptight, idiotic Agent Simmons (""You gonna lay the fate of the world on a kid's Camaro?"").Sadly, all this fun can't distract from the movie's main flaw: the running time. At 144 minutes, it is way too long for a flick like this, and some of the action scenes (especially the final showdown, which goes on and on for what seems like an eternity) could have been shortened, leaving the movie with an acceptable duration (let's say two hours) and more time spent on the human side of the story rather than the CGI.Still, Tranformers is probably the year's smartest dumb movie. Plus, any film that's cheeky enough to make fun of its director (""This is so much better than Armageddon!"" a character says halfway through the picture) deserves a look.","Jul 5, 2007",8,/10
"I couldn't even make it through this movie. It has wonderful effects, is very visually intense, I have little doubt in a good theater sound environment it would melt your brain from the overload of stimulation. Myself, I watched it on the small screen, and I was bored to tears. The characters are all thin, poorly developed and generally uninteresting. The plot barely keeps its head above the clumsy pile of bad comedy relief, teen angst and Mtv-style geek sexuality. The robots are impressive, though soulless. Michael Bay continues to show outside of blowing things up, he's not worth much. It makes for a loud roller-coaster ride of special effects and explosions, but it sorely lacking in story, character development, plot development or anything else remotely interesting. When the two most compelling elements of your movie are a chattering boom-box and a fake- tanned hard-body, you haven't got much to fill the drawn out dimensions this beast took up. I gave it an hour and a half. Beyond that, I couldn't even bring myself to follow along.","Nov 11, 2007",2,/10
"Upon leaving this movie, the question was begged: Who would be a better director to handle this movie than Michael ""The Rock"" Bay? I can think of no one better. It was a blast. In a summer filled with CG downers it is refreshing to see a movie that so feverishly holds onto practical elements. Everything in this movie, even the robots of the title, look real, and when the heroes (mechanical and carbon-based) are in perilous situations, you really feel it. It has plenty of Michael Bay-esquire military might, and his pseudo science, but there is plenty of humor and heart to reach the broad audience that it so desperately aims for. The only thing that ""TransFans"" will have issue with are the fact that it is not wall-to-wall robots, such as those featured in the original 1986 film. But for everyone else, it's a blast. Shia Lebouf and Megan Fox are the perfect human surrogates for a Cybertronian battle, and you'll leave cheering.","Jun 26, 2007",8,/10
"Hollywood does it again. I don't know why this is the case, but it seems inevitable that Hollywood seems to just be on a roll as far as their agenda of white male bashing. The lead character is a male wimp at the start of the movie, He is in lust with a high school female that doesn't even know him, but is the girlfriend of the jock football star who is of course a jerk, more stereotypical stuff. She of course turns out to be a top wiz mechanic with cars and engines, including the ability to not only operate a tow truck flawlessly but do it in reverse while hooked up to one of the broken down transformers. Amazing chic! Another female is a college student ( I think) and she is smarter than all the military personnel combined. The movie really slams the men in it. Could have been a great movie but Hollywood just can't leave off feeding an unsuspecting public their underlying opinions. Too bad, good graphics and a decent plot.","Nov 8, 2007",3,/10

This will be probably the highest grossing film of Bay's career and he must be thrill, this is a blockbuster. Since his previous film ""The Island"" was an major box office flop in the U.S. The cast is engaging, including:Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson and Jon Voight. Die-Hard fans of the original animated series will certainly loves this movie. It has some clever in-jokes and trivia for the fans as well. The single disc DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound but there's no DVD extras. ""Transformers"" has insane, imaginative action sequences but it nearly wears out... its welcome towards the end. Still, it is enjoyable and it is also better than some of Bay's previous movies. One of the executive producers is Steven Spielberg. Screenplay by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. Which they wrote together movies like ""Mission:Impossible 3"", ""The Legend of Zorro"" and ""The Island"". From a story by Kurtzman, Orci and John Rogers (American Outlaws, Catwoman, The Core). Bernie Mac appears in a amusing cameo as a sleazy car salesman. Panavision. (****/*****).","Jul 8, 2007",8,/10
"Just returned home from a pre advanced viewing here inn Trondheim, Norway. How shall I put this? The movie was brilliant! OK, I might not be any smarter after viewing this mind blowing, well acted, special effects extravaganza, but holy c**p, a big popcorn menu later, I went out of the Prinsen theater with a great big smile on my face. Im 34 years old, but the kid in me woke up tonight, and started remembering Optimus Prime and Co from my childhood. Seening Prime ""alive"" at the screen made goosebumps all over me, and seeing cool Bumblebee as a Camero didn't spoil anything. Even if GM is a idiotic company, they sure makes cool cars. (Not that I will by one) And the Camero was a perfect sub for the VW. I will not spoil anything and tell anything about the movie itself, other that it was candy for the eyes, exiting and funny. A must see this summer. If a action adventure anytime deserved a top score, Transformers is the one. 10 out of 10 from me.","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"Today i saw this movie and i can tell you that the story is very simple, no Tarantino or guy ritchie here dudes.Best is to compare this movie with fast food. It's got to be quick, simple greesy, aggressive, hot and a lot. That is exactly what this flick brings. Hot cars and chicks (mikaela, oh my god) ans superb action.It's like a roller coaster great and full of action from the beginning to the end.The critics all have something against Bay i think. Go see the English Patient for crying out loud then.This is a action movie with no crap in between. Ans i like the Bay style of editing, like Armageddon, great TV.If you want action, and i mean top notch. Go see this movie, this will be in you're top 5 4 ever list.","Jul 15, 2007",10,/10

"This film was a real pleasure to behold. Seeing my beloved childhood toys and favorite cartoon explode on the big screen in a way I never imagined was just way to cool. I never thought they could make a live action Transformers that could look so realistic, but they proved me wrong. The story, well it is the Autobots versus the Decepticons of course. Granted there is more to it than that as they are trying to get to this mysterious artifact called the cube before the other group. We also have a young youth in search of his first car, lots of humor and a lot of action as well. The only complaints I have are minor as I would have liked to have seen some of the Decepticons a bit more, as Starscream and Megatron are confined to the end of the film. However, I got to see Optimus Prime a good bit so I will not complain to much about that. The action is great in this movie, as we start off with one rather impressive attack on a military base that really sets up the movie with a bang. We then have numerous other scenes of the Decepticons trying to search for the whereabouts of the cube and Megatron who has a connection with the boy searching for his first car. We have a great scene involving a Decepticon cop car and Bumble Bee (one of the Autobots) and at the end all the ends tie together in one fierce battle in the middle of a city. Great fight and an impressive conclusion to this movie. So be prepared to watch one of the more fun and action packed movies of the summer as the Autobots fight the evil forces of the Decepticons.","Jul 19, 2007",10,/10
"Starts off in a decent faction with some laid back humor and simple exploration of the protagonists mixed with wonderfully animations of transformations but soon deteriorates into testosteronical display in recent computer effects making spiced with family movie humor in a quest for a pair of glasses. If you like stock war footage you might enjoy this as the last 40 strands at an explosion every two seconds, all executed in a pace that would make Keusch cry out bad taste. Paradoxically, its furious tempo is justified by a means of incorporating clichés in a large amount as possible. This is by far the least strongest Transformers adaptation overrun by a mere marathon by versions such as Transformers Armada.","Jul 11, 2007",1,/10
"I will concede this movie has a lot of shortcomings such as under developed and needless characters and some continuity issues. However, from the moment this movie started, I felt like I was taken back to my childhood and I had just gotten home from school, grabbed a snack, and stationed myself in front of the TV for an episode of The Transformers. This movie is fun! It won't win awards or be glorified for its stinging social commentary (although I thought the George Bush ""cameo"" was very funny), but if you want to lose yourself for two plus hours, this is a great film to do that. I thought they stayed true to the story and preserved the original feel while providing incredible effects and CG. The robots even made a similar sound when they transformed as they did in the TV show. The effects are incredible! Especially some of the military hardware they use in conjunction with the CG was fluid and fit better than I have ever seen. I would have liked to seen more dialog from the robots (the comments like Prime saying ""My Bad"" were really funny), but when I left the theater I was grinning and laughing like a little kid. I haven't had this much fun at a movie in a long time. The entire crowd at my showing was a wide cross section of ages and backgrounds and every single person was into the movie and cheering and laughing and having a blast! I cannot adequately express how much fun I had at this movie. Surrender yourself to this experience and you will have a blast. Go into the theater to see ""an important film"" and you will be disappointed. I can't wait for the sequel!!!","Jul 4, 2007",8,/10
"""Megatron, by the end of this day, one shall stand, one shall fall"", Optimus Prime OK. So let me just start off by saying this is now easily one of my favorite movies ever. Seriously. It is fantastic. It is by far Michael Bay's best movie.It is Transformers. If you are any at all familiar with TF, then you won't be sad. There are changes madebut the changes make sense in 2007 vs. 1984. Every character is spot on their counterpart. Yes, Megatron isn't a gun, and Bumblebee isn't VW Beetle.but who cares? They are still very much the characters we have come to love over the years.The movie opens with a VO of Optimus Prime describing Cybertron (yes, you see Cybertron.very cool), how the race of Transformers came to be, the war, and why they are scattered all over the galaxy. There is a something called a ALL SPARK cube which is an alien artifact responsible for creating a sentient race of robots. Thousands of years ago, a group of them called DECEPTICIONS, led by Megatron wanted the All Spark cube to ""take over the galaxy"" which started the war. The planet was decimated and the cube was lost into the far reaches of space. (guess where it landed?) So, the Decepticons track it down, and the Autobots follow in pursuit. START MOVIE, etc..I was afraid that Bay would PEARL HARBOR this movie, and by that I mean he would get caught up in the human drama that he would forget the robotsmuch like his PEARL HARBOR moviewhich to me was like a 3 hour long distance phone call commercial.All the human characters are great. They fit. If you are supposed to like them, you really do. If they are supposed to be funnythey are. If they are supposed to be an assthey are. Even the dialog isn't as corny as you would expect it to be. By far, the MOST intense dialog comes from Prime himself. He is a military leader.knows good from bad, right from wrong. Some of his dialog is simply amazing. And the fact that its PRIME'S voice from our youth makes you all giddy! Shia LeBeouf is now one of my favorite actors. His sense of comedic timing is spot on. One to watch to be sure.The CGI.wow. These things transform at 90MPH. It is amazing. And the SOUNDTHE SOUND IS THERE. KKEEE KOOO KOOOO KEEE KEEEEE Were there things wrong with it? Of course. There are some plot holes, sure. Sometimes the action is SO fast that you get lost in it. It's hard to see who is fighting who. And there is not enough time spent with the robots. Of course, this movie was full of a LOT of development and expositionso perhaps for the inevitable sequel..All toldI am more than surprised about how much I like this movie. DO NOT miss this in theaters.And it is OK to get goose bumps when you hear Optimus say "" AUTOBOTS.ROLL OUT!""","Jun 29, 2007",10,/10
"it had been a long wait, years to be exact. i had always wanted to see a live action transformers film and unlike most people i didn't care if michael bay directed it, i just wanted to see the results of someones vision and what i saw at midnight today was an amazing. you could tell michael bay exceeded a lot of expectations especially by packing so much action into a movie that was 2 and a half hours long or so but flew by because it wasn't boring in anyway. it seems the talk about this movie circles the CGI, and i will admit that the CGI is just beyond amazing and the realism is just exact. combined with all the intricate designs, parts and details they made the transformers above and beyond what CGI in other movies has done. i could even see scratches, dents, cracks and little minor details in every transformer from beginning to end. oh i also want to add that the emotion in bumblebees eyes reminded me a lot of optimus prime dying in the first movie, thus making my eyes water and i shed a few tears, if you don't feel a thing, you're not human. the messages the movie conveys are pretty straight forward, like when ironhide asks why they're protecting the humans, since they are a primitive and violent race, that just makes you realize he spoke the truth. anyhow, having the midnight screening tickets and building anticipation to seeing it was way worth it, i love the movie and hope a lot of people go see it, i think everyone should.","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10
"There's something wrong with Transformers. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'll try my best to explain how I felt as the movie went from start to finish, and perhaps you, the reader out there, can figure out what I mean.The movie started off well enough, lots of mystery and suspense, the character development of the many heroes were all right. Some relatively funny lines. So far so good.Now comes the body. A bit confusing. What is the focus here? We are introduced to good guys, who behave so much like bad guys you immediately assume villain! villain! whack the SOB! Then the finale. A very long drawn out action sequence, overwhelming the senses and numbing them. So much destruction and carnage goes on that it is impossible that our heroes continue to stand without even a scratch on them. I kept watching and waiting. Look, there's an entire building made of concrete destroyed by a transformer, our hero is in its midst, surely a splinter would pierce his foot, surely he'd get whacked on the head and go unconscious, or at least get stunned. But no, he still has smooth skin, its a miracle. This happens over and over and over again, until I grew quite tired of it.I am also amused by the sudden dependence on this unlikely hero. His task could have easily been carried out, with much greater efficiency, by a transformer. All the while I thought, plot hole, BIG plot hole.Many of the characters are very unconvincing. We have senior army personnel acting like children.Music direction was very VERY poor. Too many times, epic-like music was played at relatively unimportant points. You immediately assume something significant is about to happen, but you end up disappointed.If you are a devoted Transformers fan, please do go for this movie. The transformers are beautifully rendered and remind me so much of the cartoon when I was a kid. This movie will please fans. If, on the other hand, you want to be entertained by a 'good' action movie, you might be disappointed. I know I was.","Jul 2, 2007",5,/10
"To be honest before I saw this movie I had my doubts about it, I was worried that it'd follow down the path of AVP, I was also doubtful about how the changes from the cartoon to the big screen, my expectations were very low and I though it would flop.Then I saw this movie and in short: ""IT FRIGGIN ROCKED""The combination of perfectly directed Action sequences and three way story lines later intertwining into one as the movie entered a very climatic action sequenceBumblebee really stole the show early on bringing up songs on his radio that normally you wouldn't do just made the scene hilariousThere were a lot of nods to the original series from the original transformation noise, to a hilarious take on the classic quote ""More than meets the eye""There were only two things that I am nit picking at; First is Megan Fox's character Mikaela she didn't really do much other than stand around and look pretty, Second was due to the Transformers incredible size during the action sequences it was a little difficult to figure out what was going on in some scenes,But those aside, my Summary described it ""Best film this year so far"" Oh and one more thing: DON'T DOWNLOAD IT OR WAIT FOR IT TO COME TO DVD, This is a film that's MADE for the big screen, on a TV screen even if you have a Plasma you won't get the enjoyment as much as you would on anything but a Cinema screenWell done Michael Bay, your best movie ever!!!!!","Jun 28, 2007",9,/10
"I rated this movie a 2. For me, that means it was mostly in focus. Mostly. This movie is so awful I had a hard time not screaming during viewing. Actually, that isn't entirely true. I did scream a few times. This movie is stupid. Painfully stupid. I just wasted 2 hours of my life stupid. They should have a film crimes commission that can try villains like Michael Bay, who has serially made bad movies. Pearl Harbor was Lawrence of Arabia compared to this. Plot holes, logic problems, and just terrible acting abound in this piece of garbage. I recommend it only for the brain dead, and Florida policemen. Okay, apparently I have to write more to get this submitted. Acceptable punishments for those responsible: First, none must be allowed to make any more movies. Second, the writer, director, and producer must be thrown from a plane without a parachute, and land in a wood chipper with dull blades. Thirdly, all the money made off this must go to build hospitals and schools to help repair the damage this crap has caused to civilization.","Feb 18, 2008",2,/10

"Before this movie came out, i don't even know what the ""Transformers"" are. Even when i first saw the poster of this movie, i didn't really interested in it. But, when the trailer comes out, i expected it would be great. And when i saw it, i realize that it's more than great. It's amazing.For people that wasn't really ""Transformers's"" fans, i think, as long as you like fantasy-action movie, you'll like this one too. Like me! The point is this movie can take many new fans, not only the ""old"" fans. And when some people say only boys will like it, they were totally wrong. Even if you're a girl, you will still amazed by this movie.It's also amazing how they can manage to combine the computer work and the real work. The actors are also amazing. It's amazing how they can act like the robots are really there, while they weren't.It wasn't really surprising to know that this movie is amazing. Why? Because it directed & produced by two of the greatest director & producer i know, Michael Bay & Steven Spielberg.I highly recommended this to any Tranformers fans or non-fans, especially a fantasy-action movie fans.

"... yeah well this is basically that in 2007. Same marketing campaign- July 4 + Earth's Destruction = Fighting For Our Independence as a Race. First of all, thank god they didn't take themselves too seriously. The opening line explains ""The Cube"" and right there you know that this movie is meant to be fun. The CGI and effects were amazing and definitely took it to another level. The action was cool and choreographed well. Although some of the scenes reminded me of other movies... oh yeah they were all from other Michael Bay movies. It was corny- everything that came out of the robots' mouths was corny but it reminded you that its supposed to be fun and that Hollywood still has some respect for the fans. There were many parts that left the audience laughing due to Shia's acting. Also, Megan Fox is eye candy and great eye candy at that. Her alone was worth the price of admission. If you like popcorn movies, this could top them all.","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10
"I don't understand why Transformers got such a big hype, i guess if you stick a legendary title like that onto a movie and put any crappy plot into it which a 10 year old could write, it will still sell. First of all the action scenes left me bored, everything about them was bland and didn't leave me to question what would happen next. I also hated the voice acting from the Transformer robots, it sounded so scripted and rushed, the bad ""comical"" lines spewed out by them just made things 10 times worse for me.Had i watched this movie 5 years ago when i was 13, i probably would have loved it, but then i see reviews saying ""This is by no means a children's only movie"", which it just plain is. How this is in the top 30 grossing movies of all time, i just don't know, something about that doesn't seem right.5/10","Feb 3, 2008",5,/10
"First of all, this movie is AMAZING. I loved it, and so did everyone around me at the theater, clapping at the end while the credits rolled (not a very usual reaction from where I'm from: Winnipeg, in Canada). BUT!!!!!!!! The movie concentrated too much on the Autobots and the Decepticons were left out as just a menacing, violent group of soldiers who can really kick ass. With less than 20 minutes of screen-time, the movie missed the opportunity of showing a crucial aspect from The Transformers, and that is the struggle between Starscream and Megatron. You know Megatron disdains Starscream by the very first thing he says to him (You failed again, Starscream!).. that line made the movie for me, but Starscream's part seems more like a cameo than an actual part of the movie! WE NEED MORE STARSCREAM!!! WE NEED MORE DECEPTICONS!!! I REALLY hope that this is will be fixed in the sequel. Of course, I WILL be there again for the premier next year, or whenever it comes out.","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10

"Well I have to say that I was not a big transformers fan as a kid, but this is one of my top 3 all time favorites. I absolutely loved it. At 23 years old my wife and I found it very entertaining, and it is hard to keep my wife's attention for over 2 hours, and this did just that. I feel that the PG-13 rating was perfect. There was a little cursing, but it was nothing to cry about. The special effects were top notch, and the fun factor was excellent. This didn't have the corny dialogue that we were expecting. Overall it was extremely well written, well planned, and produced. I would call it less of a viewing, but more of an ""experience"". Personally I wouldn't see how anyone could give it less than an 8 because it was missing something. I am also happy that this movie did not just jump right in to the main storyline, but introduced the characters, and situation well. THIS IS ONE OF MY TOP THREE MOVIES OFF ALL TIME...PUTTING IT IN LINE WITH: (just to give you an idea) 1.STAR WARS (classic action/scifi flick) 2.CADDYSHACK (you have to have a comedy in the top 5) 3.TRANSFORMERS (in elite company) 4.TERMINATOR (another original classic scifi) 5.HOOSIERS (all time greatest sports movie)","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10

You never get bored watching it and, even if it might not fit the older series, it's amazing.I'd say that it's like Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade . The mix of fun and action really remembers the one in the Indy movies. The visual effects are outstanding. Compared to this, both Spiderman 3 and Pirates OTC 3 are nothing.Congratulations to the director and the producers (come on Spielberg, we all can see your hand behind all of this).","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"Now, before I rave on about this movie, I will say that I never had watched the cartoon series of Transformers and had little idea of what to expect. I'd heard the hype but was sceptical with the knowledge that Hollywood hype is nothing to write home about. A few examples include Spiderman 3, The 90's Batman movies, Smoking Aces, Hannibal and almost every sequel of the last ten years that has followed up the original title that was a revolutionary for its time (The Matrix anybody?)Besides the flawless CGI and visual effects, that have superseded anything of my generation and the generation before it, this movie had several assets that made the movie an experience to behold. Bay and Spielberg were very clever on the selection table with a cast, which may be established within the industry (Las Vegas, Disturbia and anything Jon Voight has done) they chose people who have an ability to act and delivery in a unique fashion and an effective way, over the usual Hollywood big names. The dialogue, which I expected to be filled with one liners and cheesy tyrades from key characters was surprisingly fresh and witty and as I found in the cinema I watched it in, received laughter and found relevance. This is explicitly clear in the way the script takes a ridiculous scene or notion (which is bound to happen in a Transformer film) and made fun of itself and took your mind off the situation with its humour. Also the change of tone within the script brought action, humour and drama, intertwining all these separate genres into a script that captures your imagination and drags you through these separate emotions. The score was fitting, the transformers themselves were portrayed stunningly and in a modern sense, without destroying the character of the different transformers in this transition. In other words, the only problem that I could really find with the movie besides continuations and goofs which are a given, was the voice of Megatron. Don't get me wrong Hugo Weaving was fitting for the role, but I simply felt that they hid his voice under the disguise of the former voice portrayed in the series. I thought a more Matrix style voice (i.e Agent Smith) would subtly create a more evil formation of Megatron but nonetheless the voice was good at worst. The build up to the appearance of all the Transfomers was captivating in itself.I never thought I'd hear myself rave about such a film, but the fact that I decided to finally post a review about a movie shows the effect this film can have on even the most cynical and sceptical. In other words, give it a go, forget the hype and enjoy the moment, cause trust me...the hype doesn't get lost in the movie and the film leaves itself open for more to come with a story that gives the basics without giving too much away.CPF","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"One of the worst films I've ever nearly sat through. This movie actually put me in a bad mood. I wanted all the characters in it to be bombed 20mins in. If you liked it fair play to you but I couldn't bare the script and the performances. The direction was sloppy, it was a bit like the kids in it directed themselves. On a similar theme If someone told me that all the lines in it were ad-lib (made up by the actors on the spot), I would believe it, to think script writers were sourced and paid to come up with this garbage actually boils my pisss. I see also the budget for this stinker was about £150-000-000, I can think of better ways to burn cash.","Aug 4, 2007",1,/10
"I had seen this movie recently and I was surprised with how exciting and suspenseful this movie really was. I would've thought it would be a simple children's movie much like the original 80s cartoon movie, but this movie can be interesting for not only the children but also the adults and maybe fans of the popular cartoon. I was excited when they finally introduced Bumblebee in a totally new look being a Camaro then the famous VW Beetle.What really got me hooked was the introduction to Optimus Prime and the Autobots who seemed extraordinary in their own way. Peter Cullen did a fine job of providing the voice of his renowned character Optimus Prime. The rest of the cast did a excellent job expressing the reality of these alien beings like Shia LeBeouf who did a fantastic job of becoming the hero and also Hugo Weaving playing the menacing and evil Megatron leading the Decepticons in their desperation for world domination and destruction.The graphics and action sequences were astonishing showing the true destruction of what these creatures were capable of and what made this movie interesting to watch. I recommend that anyone that is a fan of the series or just wants to watch it I say grab a ticket sit down with some popcorn and ready to enjoy the Transformers like you wouldn't believe.I rate this movie 10/10 and you'll see why...","Jul 1, 2007",10,/10
"Maybe it was the forgettable soldiers in the beginning, spouting ""speak English, Mexican"" type lines which turned me off from this explosion-fest. Megan Fox, protégé to the Jennifer Connelly School of Dull Acting, could have been a major factor in my dislike of this movie as well. This, of course, would come into conflict with her acting credentials of breasts, a revealing shirt and close-ups of said-breasts. Perhaps it was the pretentious score attempting to be poignant or sound like ""Batman Begins."" The stereotypical voice of Transformer ""Jazz"" could have provided ample reason for my utter dislike of this ""blockbuster."" However, I feel that a line like ""Stop, or we will kill you"" best sums up my apprehension towards movies attempting to be more than meets the eye while utterly failing in the process.","May 29, 2008",1,/10

At first, I thought its some kind of old school Robo-show with bombs and flashes everywhere but I was wrong.The whole movie's effects were GREAT, the lighting effects is really dramatic.

"I walked into the theater expecting a great movie, but even I was dazzled by the sheer magnificence of what hit me. From the opening massacre up until the end credits rolled, I physically was unable to move from my seat. The best directorial combination I have seen in years - Michael Bay's best decision was to be advised by the big man himself. Spielberg's touch is evident in the development of the characters and pardon the repetition of the relation between Bumblebee and Shia Leboeuf being a throwback to boy-and-ET. Computer graphics can not go unmentioned in relation to this movie, and dreamworks really outshone themselves. Great acting as well by Leboeuf. I felt he was one of the brightest things about Disturbia, and he's brought that same depth, innocence and intensity to his character in Transformers. While relations between the Transformers themselves could have been developed a wee bit more, it wouldn't improve much on the movie as it is (I'd mention scenes, but I'm keeping this review spoiler-free). Also detracting from sending this movie down in history as one of the best was probably an abundance of humour, which I believe was slightly overdone. While certain moments (think ""pheromones"") were pretty original and appreciated, some others were just cheesy (think ""S7 vest"") and, in my opinion, and provoked unnecessary giggles while they could have furthered characters. That being said, the movie still comes out smelling like roses - Michael Bay is here to stay. Last but definitely not least, no review is complete without a mention of the soundtrack. While I have heard a couple of people complain about how the soundtrack could have been more grand and less hip, I feel that the relative lack of orchestral scoring was well in keeping with the not-too intense mood of the film, and that at appropriate moments, the right kind of music (including some grand 'Lord of the Rings' stylised tunes) was used. As an Australian movie-goer commented, ""this movie couldn't have used those songs and still been what it was. It was amazing. Truly awesome. The music DID match the film very well. If I'd seen this list before I saw the movie I probably would of agree with all of you but the fact of the matter is that a lot of the songs break from each respective band's usual style. It worked. Believe me."" Let me conclude by stating firstly, that this is the first movie in which I stopped halfway through the movie to recognise just how perfectly the music flowed with the mood generated on screen. Secondly, the Bay-Spielberg combination was a marvel, but I believe they should leave well enough alone, and in my opinion, neither should agree to a sequel, as it can only disappoint after the stratospheric standards set by this film. Lastly, while this is no Lord of the Rings, look for a couple of Oscar nods, and a massive box office taking.To summarise - Not flawless, but as close as humanly possible!!","Jul 2, 2007",10,/10

"After seeing the trailers, reading up on the net and discussing with my colleagues, I was convinced this was MY kinda movie: Action, and sci-fi. I was totally convinced this was a great movie. After five minutes my expectations were already met and then some. When the movie was over I was grinning like a moron - action (OK, GREAT action), sci-fi (and actually - umm - ""convincing"" plot) - and (surprise!!!) great humor! So, some robots transformed to other vehicles and some robots did not transform at all into what they did in the the TV series - but so what? The series was a kid's show from the eighties and we are now in an entire new century! Michael Bay gave the Transformers a much needed upgrade. The IBM PC was running MS-DOS when the first Autobot and Decepticon revealed themselves on TV, and nobody had even heard about Internet until well after the original Transformers series ended. Some could not transform because of legal issues - and some items looked just plain dumb in 2007.I just have to agree with Steven Spielberg: ""Michael Bay was born to make Transformers""","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"This is a very well produced action movie with good acting, outstanding CGI and special effects and an ear numbing soundtrack. There are several wonderful jokes slipped in, my favorite being the clip during the credits when Sam's mom expresses her confidence in the government's dependability to warn us, ""to duck and cover."" The movie is careful to avoid any language which could be considered offensive, not even a ""damn."" The only sex is a scene that reminded me a lot of many car commercials aimed at the NASCAR crowd. We get to see a little ""bathroom humor"" when the dog pees on a robot and a robot pees on an unpleasant government official. Perfect fit for 12-16 year old boy target audience. After those positives, the reader might wonder at my low rating. The movie gets all five points I give it for what I've written above. It should get a negative five for everything else about it. Transformers is no longer an extended advertisement for the Hasboro toys of the same name. This version is a slick commercial for the military packaged precisely for the young teen boys who will watch it. Scenes in the movie are exact copies of ads for the Army, Marines, Reserves and National Guard. All the army guys are cool, quick, smart, heroic and supported by honest, hard-working, highly-trained and courageous backups. They pack LOTS of firepower and even when an entire base is wiped out by a single Discepticon there is NO BLOOD, NO WOUNDED, NOBODY SCREAMING IN PAIN. This is the worst kind of violence there is. The movie glorifies blasting away at things and NEVER shows the results. Further, the soldiers are good buddies, talk to their wives and kids on the internet and seem to be having a great time even when they are getting their a___es shot off. Reviewers often comment on the product placement that takes place in movies. The military had better have paid these producers a significant fee for this two-hour-long advertisement for how great it is to be an ""army man."" If you can avoid taking your boy to this movie, do so. If not, take a minute to interject a little reality therapy. The US invasion of Iraq is costing our country a huge price in young men and women. It is immoral and unethical to sell such misguided policy with a slick movie based on little kid's toys.","Jul 9, 2007",5,/10
"I was expecting it to be that good coming from Michael bay and produced by Spielberg. In the movie house people were cheering, laughing, clapping and screaming. Never had those reactions from people since spiderman 2. The film was amazing and very entertaining. I grew up watching the cartoons and i think they did an exceptional job! I watched it with my family, my kids were glued to the screen which was very rare, usually they tend to fall asleep or mess around when watching a movie. Everyone will enjoy it fans and non fans will love it. To top it off after the movie the people gave it a standing ovation!","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10
"OK, there's just one word that I can use to describe this movie - awesome!!!!! When I went to see it movie I admit that I had high expectations but what I saw just blew me away. Some people said that the movie was too long but I really enjoyed every scene in it and especially the CGI effects. I give credit for the look of every transformer all the way from the human-sized Frenzy to the massive Blackout. The CGI will be leading my league of the best CGI effects ever seen in a movie. Just take a look at the ending battle, Optimus Prime against Megatron, two gigantic Transformers in a massive fighting scene.But I didn't come to praise the movie and give it a top report only for the effects. This is also a movie with great acting. Some may not see it this way but I am impressed with the cast that they could pretend talking and even fighting to something that didn't even exist.Transformers had it all, action, comedy, excitement and romance. The comics really increased the movie, but what I didn't expect at first was that the robots should utter the funniest things in it. From top to bottom this is one of the best films I've seen and possible ever will see. I just can't believe all the critics that say that the movie isn't following the series and on and on with stuff like that.I promise that who ever wants firing action and excitement, this is the movie you should watch at. When I came out from the cinema I just wanted to rush into the auditorium at tell them to play it again.And those will be my last words Amen.","Jul 8, 2007",9,/10
"1) There are lots of consistencies and inconsistencies between this flick, the cartoon, and the animated movie...guess what? It's not 198whatever anymore. We're in the Iraq war, not the end of the cold war.3) It IS one GIANT commercial for the US army and several car companies (and, of course, Hasbro).4) IT STILL ROCKS! In some reductionist, populist way it promotes the theory of the just war. It hearkens back to the childhood of any 20something male in this country. Peter Cullen (of eyeore fame) is STILL the voice of Optimus Prime, so you'll get shivers and start cheering when he speaks for the first time. The whole theater was cheering last night, when Prime made his first appearance.The special effects are amazing which makes me disappointed that the promo has been lacking recently. The movie prolly won't bust blocks profit-wise.Finally, the comic relief is reminiscent of lots of live-action remakes of cartoons from the 80s-90s: Teenage Mutant Ninka Turtles, He Man, Super Mario Brothers. It's GOOFY, but you'll love it.","Jun 28, 2007",9,/10

"Wow!!! I love just came back from watching the movie....The movie rocks. Nice CGI effects, great, funny scenes and dialogs. This movie is cool......I wanna watch it again....But sadly its fully booked for the whole week...Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay should be given credits for this movie. Hope to see more movies like this from Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay. Cool.....This movie is going to be chart-toppers.I think it's going to be something the audience has never seen before. In all the years of movie-making, I don't think the image of a truck transforming into a 20-foot tall robot has ever been captured on screen. I also want to make a film that's a homage to 1980s movies and gets back to the sense of wonder that Hollywood has lost over the years. It will have those Spielberg-ian moments where you have the push-in on the wide-eyed kid and you feel like you're 10 years old even if you're 35.""","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10

"I saw the movie yesterday and I was blown away. Not only by the SFX but also by the movie itself. It was so much better then I expected.I am 25 years old and grew up with the cartoons and toys G1. I thought that the movie would be totally different than the series and of course it has a total different feeling. The movie is centered around humans instead of the 'bots but the subtle references mad to the first episodes of the cartoon are beautiful. I was really pleased with it! I really liked the 1 line story principle and the fact that it was like 5 Autobots against 5 Decepticons, just like every episode of the cartoons! The movies spider-man 3 and PotC are so plot thick that you can't follow the story anymore, this movie has no problems like that! In my opinion this is the best summer blockbuster movie this year till now.","Jun 29, 2007",10,/10

"MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE. I am a nerd and was a child in the 80's, so I am a little biased towards this movie. I love comics and superhero movies. Last night I had a chance to see a LIVE-ACTION movie of my favorite cartoon of my youth. TRANSFORMERS came to the big screen, and I waited with eager anticipation to catch a glimpse of OPTIMUS PRIME and BUMBLEBEE since I heard about the movie a couple years ago.This is my thoughts on the flick. This movie absolutely blew me away. Being a fan of the original series and toyline, I wasn't looking forward to some of the changes that were bound to take place. Changes in the names and modes of some of the characters wasn't setting with me too well, but I could look over that as long as the story was there. Trust me the story was definitely there! There is action and there is heart in this movie. Action and heart are something that's sometimes difficult for a filmmaker to incorporate in together. It's also difficult to make a giant robot into a character that you can care for. Michael Bay managed all of this very well IMO.One thing on Bay real fast... I was really hoping he wouldn't screw this up. I think that about every director who tries to do a movie based on characters that I know and love. Sam Raimi with Spider-Man, Mark Steven Johnson with Daredevil and Ghost Rider, Chris Nolan with Batman Begins, and so on. I think Bay truly stood up to the test of adapting without changing much. I commend him for that.So back to the movie. Shia LeBeouf was good as the protagonist Sam Witwicky. Despite what you think about him from being in Disney movies and the such, he's turning out to be a pretty good young actor. You see him change and mature in the movie. From a 16 year old who just wants a car and the girl, to a young man who is willing to go up against a psychopathic robot.Megan Fox... Well she's the love interest to young Sam Witwicky (LeBeouf) and serves two purposes. Purpose one: Eye candy. having a beautiful young lady as one of the leads of a movie for 10-30 year old males is seldom a bad thing for a film. Purpose two: She helps the Sam character grow from a bumbling hormonal teenager to the young man who is willing to go up against a psychopathic robot.So enough about the human characters, and on to the thing that is really selling this movie. GIANT FREAKIN' ROBOTS! The AUTOBOT characters are very true to their characters that I grew up watching. IRONHIDE was a bit of a hot head with a good heart. JAZZ was the perfect second in command. He did his job, watched over the other AUTOBOTS, and fought valiantly. RATCHET we didn't get to see a whole lot of, but he was caring and the voice of reason. BUMBLEEBEE was always my second favorite robot. He was a lot like Rudy Ruettieger in being a small guy with the heart of a true hero. You root for him to overcome obstacles and be the hero he is. Last but certainly not least OPTIMUS PRIME! PRIME was always kind of a mythical figure to me. He was a strong and moral leader. As a kid hearing him tell MEGATRON, in the 1986 cartoon movie, ""One shall stand, one shall fall."" was iconic! Seeing him in this movie, and having the voice of Peter Cullen, the original voice of PRIME in the series, was amazing. He lived up to any expectations a TRANSFORMERS fan should have.Since I spent so much time on the good guys, I won't bore you much with the DECEPTICONS. Some of the characters names were changed, and not what they originally were in the series, but that's fine by me. I understand that to change from the median of comic books/cartoons into a live-action movie, that things have to change. The highlight of the DECEPTICONS came when MEGATRON tells his number 1 ""You have failed me yet again STARSCREAM!"" Classic MEGATRON/STARSCREAM relationship.It's hard to put my personal feelings aside in this movie as a fan. However one of the people that went with me to the movie had not been a fan and came in expecting an action movie, and she really enjoyed it. So if you are a fan, or not a fan, it's enjoyable. I give it an enthusiastic 2 thumbs up!","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10
"This movie was definitely a disappointment. The original Transformers: The Movie was AWESOME, and to this day still remains one of my favorites.THIS movie was a special effects monster with much to be desired in the way of plot and storyline. It kept switching between being a film that took itself seriously and being downright cartoony. Furthermore, references to the first movie and original cartoon series were very forced.The worst part? The credits tell us it is based on the action figures manufactured by Hasbro, not on the original series or ideas. Guess we know who bankrolled the movie.","Jul 6, 2007",3,/10
"Growing up in the 80s, you can't help but take notice of the Transformers toys which can change from various vehicles to robots, or the cartoon series which had a pretty good run, with its fair share of spin offs having different character variations (Headmasters anyone?), settings in outer space, 3D animation (Optimus Prime as a mean looking gorilla), all great symbiotic marketing strategies between the toys and the cartoons. But one thing about the animated series though, both the Autobots and the Decepticons had lousy aim, which the Movie (1986) sought to correct, and ""traumatized"" (well, at least me when I was a kid watching this) kids with mortality for the beloved bots.When Michael Bay was announced to have taken over an updated movie version of Transformers, I was a bit apprehensive, especially when character designs started to leek, and I admit, they were not really pleasing to the eye, and most, if not all, had vehicle model updates. So if anyone's a stickler that the characters must look like their animated originals or the toys, then it is likely you'll probably not enjoy the movie since you can't stand the sight of blasphemous character designs. There are some liberties that the cartoons take, which the movie tries hard to address, especially with the transformation bits, designing which part goes where instead of hiding unwanted bits (especially wheels) magically, though broad strokes for certain characters were maintained.But I'm glad to say, this IS a Transformers movie, albeit a little updated in Michael Bay style for the big screen, a worthy summer popcorn blockbuster which delivers and satisfies. It bears Bay's signature style, and truly, it was one heck of an adrenaline ride from start to finish, pausing only to allow you to breathe a little (with some comedy which might not be everyone's cup of tea, like that call-center bit), before ripping everything up again. It's loud, it's noisy, with the usual camera work you'd come to expect from Bay's brand of total mayhem when he unleashes the action. There are times when the intricate character designs work against the movie in the action sequences though, with too many details on screen, and the robots seem to be collapsing in a heap of metal when they clash head on. But these scenes of robots clashing in an urban landscape were mighty realistic, as are the slick transformation sequences, and will leave the fan boy inside you whooping for joy.Fans should be pleased with the effort that went into the live action movie. I was grinning from ear to ear with the little sly bits of references incorporated, like the classic transformation sound effects inherited from the cartoons, and if you keep your ears peeled, you might pick out lines here and there which were reminiscent of the cartoon series and the animated movie back in 1986. The scene in the autoshop with Bernie Mac was fun, especially with the jab at having an actual Volkswagon Beetle parked beside the new look Bumblebee (which I thought behaved like Herbie the Love Bug for the most parts of its introduction, despite the update in look). There were some inevitable Bay movie references like the flare bit for signalling which was a tad too obvious, and some 360 degree cameraThe story's not as bad as I would expect it to be, but it's nothing to shout about as well, being but just a vehicle (pardon the pun) to move the story from action sequence to action sequence. It managed to cram quite a bit in its 143 minute run time, especially in its many human fronts on dealing with a perceived invasion - you have an updated ""Spike"" (Shia LaBeouf) and his new girl Mikaela (Megan Fox) being caught in the thick of things with their direct friendship with the Autobots, a group of soldiers led by Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) dealing with Decepticon attacks in the Middle East, and Secretary of Defense Keller (Jon Voight) trying to understand the situation by enlisting a group of hackers, which includes Maggie (Rachael Taylor). As you can tell, the humans have quite a bit going on, and Transformers allowed them to get in on the action as well, making it man versus machine too.Plenty of things went right in my opinion. The casting of Peter Cullen to voice Optimus Prime was a major coup in lending this movie some credibility, as is the replacement voice of Megatron with Hugo Weaving's. The filmmakers too addressed the issue of Megatron pretty nicely - the handgun will just not work in a live action film, and would especially be stretching it a bit should the handgun turn into a gigantic robot. The selection of the Autobots was probably ideal in having Ironhide, Jazz, Ratchet supporting Bumblebee and Prime, leaving the rest for possible future movies. Prime's sympathy for humans again gets exploited by Megatron (though most times verbally, which got repetitive), and what was quite lacking, were the weapons. Prime's black cannon, if I'm right, only managed a very brief appearance, as does Megatron's, as the battles are more fist fights rather than laser gun battles (which they might miss!) And was that Prime's Autobot Leadership Matrix peeking out of his chest?Watching the Autobots roll out on a highway brought out the goosebumps, and with the door being left open for follow up movies, should this do well in the box office, then we can expect more rolling, and the advent of more characters! And if rumours of the coming of Unicron are correct, then we all know what to expect of Megatron.","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"For me the first transformers film is only one watchable from bay franchise and it was made with some set of skills that bay still had but not for long unfortunetly for us since we had to experience rest of this films and suffer , even if this film is watchable it still has a lot of problems ,human characters are completly useless and boring through entire plot of film also i dont know why story focused so much on humans and not on autobots and decepticons like we wanted and expected to see,megan is also not so good in this film and some jokes arent so funny at all mixed with annoying sideline characters,in end transformers has nice visuals and fight moments but that is were good staff ends and bad one begin","Feb 19, 2020",5,/10
"Transformers: The Motion Picture is by far one of the most surprising Summer blockbuster pictures ever made. It is about a teenager who holds the key to the cube. Led by Optimus Prime, of the heroic Autobots, they wage their war against Megatron and the evil Decepticons. The biggest surprise in this picture is the voice of Prime belongs to Peter Cullen of the 1984-87 Sunbow/Marvel cartoon series of the same film title. The only downfall of the film is they do not have Frank Welker's voice of Megatron, but it's forgiven.Filled with stunning visual effects, comedy, and human drama, this is without a shadow of doubt the BEST action film of the Summer. If I were you, I would personally buy the 2-disc set. It contains exclusive behind the scenes including the movie trailer. Transformers: The Motion Picture earns an A+. Way to go, Michael Bay!!!","Oct 23, 2007",10,/10
"This is the best movie I have ever seen and when I first heard about it I didn't even want to give it a chance. I thought to myself, why would they make a real movie about little toys. Naturally, I refused to see it then after everyone giving it raving reviews I figured I'd give it a try. First of all the plot was fantastic but the graphics were by far the best ever in a movie. They made the robots transition flawlessly from robot to vehicle. And just to put the icing on the cake I loved the acting and I thought Shia Labeouf did an absolutely fantastic job. Finally, Megan Fox...wow.. she did a good job but honestly if she didn't no one would have noticed because she is so beautiful. But all and all the movie at a little bit of everything and I am so happy I watched it!!","Jul 22, 2008",10,/10
"Excellent movie with heavy music, what can go wrong? Michael Bay is best for directing big action with exploding things. We get intense action scenes which will make time go pass by very fast and by the time it ends, you will not find yourself on the cinema's seat. You would want to pay money to watch it again. That is what I feel like. After watching it, I feel like going back to watch it a second time. I can easily say that this is one of my favourite movies. It is cool, it will blast your head off.The music makes this movie more interesting. With heavy music following the action-packed scenes, this movie can be the best action movie of 2007. That is what I can say. Now we come to the story, the story, Sam falls in love with a hot girl, Mikaela. He buys a car which transforms into Bumblebee, one of the Autobots. Then from there, the evil Decepticons start chasing Sam for the glasses that leads to the Allspark. The story is simple. Bay can't handle complex storyline, his style is the all time big action. No wonder he was asked to direct a robot movie. Steven Spielberg thought Transformers should have big action. If he wants that, then he had called the right man. Bay managed to make the modern Transformers. The designs don't really look like the old cartoon but at least they are realistic in our world. You don't want to see old cartoon designs with big blocky hands and legs in our world.What can I say? In the end you have the final say to whether to watch it or not. You want to see robots banging each other with bare fist or weapons, this choice is yours. It gets pretty fun when you see the Autobots and Decepticons smashing each other's ass. Action fans or transformers' fans will like it. This movie is not only for Transformers'fans, people who like action or robots will probably catch this too. Definitely a big blockbuster movie! We are hoping for a part 2.","Jul 14, 2007",10,/10
"As someone who loved the cartoons and animated movie, and was obsessed with the Transformers toys as a kid, I was elated when I found out there was going to be a live action movie! Then I sat through this garbage! I can't believe Michael Bay has been given the opportunity to make so many of these garbage movies! The way they transform is ridiculous, there's no character development, no storyline, and they completely ignore the original story. The ONLY movie worth watching is Bumblebee (2018). There's no morality, no story, no character development, just a war between good robots and bad robots that spread from their planet to earth, killing, and blowing things up!","Feb 2, 2025",3,/10
"With such a high rating on IMDb and the promising advert I just had to go and see this. Expecting it to be a cheap remake of the cartoon I found it a lot different. In a good way! Reasons why to see this: The best visual effects this summer.The best humour in an action movie.Giant robots! - Fast and fun! Reasons not: - Slightly cheesy.Maybe a little to action sequence orientated for some.As you can see the reasons to see it out way the reasons not, so see this movie. Highly Recommended.","Jul 21, 2007",10,/10
"I cannot believe that people gave good reviews for this drivel. The only thing worse than the pee jokes and ridiculous plot (the world is ending but Sam Witwicky is worried about his parents finding out there are robots in the yard) is Shia LaBeouf's crap ass acting. How top Hollywood producers can scour the world for talent and come up with him is shocking. Is it the name? Is it the face? Is it maybe because he comes up with his own lines? Whatever the case, for some diabolical reason Hollywood is going to have this son of Satan on the illustrious silver screen for as long as they can float him.Did you know that ""when casting for the role of Robert Ford it came down to Casey Affleck and Shia LaBeouf. Affleck eventually got the role, because LaBeouf was felt to be too young.""????!!?!?!?!? Too young?!?!?! The thought of him single handedly almost ruining that movie makes me shudder.Oh, and he's going to be the next Indiana Jones. What a way to end a franchise you pickle-brained producers.If/when Armageddon comes, you won't have to take a cyanide pill or throw yourself off a cliff. You can just buy this movie and play it at home. The sheer power of SUCK rays will melt your brain like Velveeta.","Oct 12, 2007",1,/10

The magical voice of Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime...YES! Watch it at least yearly!","Oct 28, 2021",10,/10
"If we'd grade the film just for the visual effects, without a doubt, we gave it a 10/10, sensational shots, the battles between decepticons and autobots were stunning, near being real. Remarkably the flick aims to visual effects Oscar award, but I think Michael Bay only work hard on this point, What happened with the rest, for instance, the plot?. I agree with some comments where criticized the roll of some actors, for example the useless performance of the soldiers after the first 10 minutes of the film, and the incoherent plot. I'm completely sure for lacking of talent in the development of history TRANSFORMERS could have been one of the best movies ever made. In spite of this, I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end, I disagree with people give it 1/10 or 2/10 just because they expected something better or it doesn't seem to the original cartoon, that's exaggerated. Anyway I recommend to see this film, it's nice, you will have a good time.","Jul 7, 2007",8,/10
"OMG! This movie was a massive steaming turd! We saw it on a double bill at the drive in with ""The Simpsons"" (which was quite entertaining BTW). Had I known that this clunker would D-R-A-G out for two and a half hours, I would have packed the kids up, and left after the first movie. This is not a big-screen epic, and should never have been treated as one. This is a ""potato chips for the brain"" movie, based on a cartoon, that was intended to sell kids' toys 25 years ago.....remember? Had it been approached properly, as a ninety minute action fest, it may have worked. As is, it was TOO long, and there was way to much detail for such fluff. Also, the action scenes were too hard to follow, as the bad guys and good guys blurred together to look the same.","Jul 31, 2007",1,/10

I had read that the female leads acting was poor but I thought it was OK. Don't want to hype it too much as it might set unfair expectations. This film was awesome. Definitely a film to be watched at the cinema unless you you have an amazing home cinema. I tend to rate films by 'would I pay to see it again', this one definitely meets that criteria. I'll leave it there as it's something to make your own judgement on. I did come out of it thinking this is definitely a boy's/man's film however the stats on here show that females have given stronger ratings. Never judge a book and all that.....","Aug 7, 2007",10,/10
"This is really a terrible movie and a total disappointment. The only upside is that there are some watchable action scenes. But even the quality of those action scenes is beneath what you would expect from a Hollywood 'blockbuster' wannabe. The movie tries to be funny, but in a way no one over 13 would appreciate. The jokes are awful to watch. When the movie is funny, it is almost always unintentional. Every character except maybe the main male character is a stereotype and played in a ridiculous way. I was sitting there thinking 'How can anyone make such a stupid movie. What a terrible waste of money and time'. I did not even wait until the end, but left the movie theater early, something I almost never do.","Aug 15, 2007",1,/10
"The audio in the film rocks loud and crisp to keep your heart rate up. The CGI is actually quite good. I thought I'd have to do some overlooking to buy that there were giant robots fighting on the screen and then transforming into vehicles, but the graphics don't miss a beat. I would have like to see some more character depth in the transformers. Watching the old cartoons I got connected to various characters and I had hoped to see more of the personalities that I remember from then. But, overall I was impressed with this movie.Bay manages to fill the entire film with nonstop action. So much so that you don't even have time to realize that the script isn't very good. As long as you don't read too much into it you will have a blast.","Jul 11, 2007",8,/10
"Oh my god! When I saw the trailer, I was pretty excited about a fact that I will get the opportunity to watch theatrical version of my favorite cartoon ever. But after I've seen it, I actually don't have any desire to watch the cartoon anymore. The movie was that good!The drama, battle scenes, Megan Fox and stuff will make this movie one of my favorite movies ever. I couldn't believe how all the pieces came together so well and so emotional. The very first scene will blow you away (if you have seen the film, you'll know what I mean).Shia LeBouf did an amazing job there. I'm pretty sure that he is going to be one of the most wanted and one of the best very soon (you could watch him in Disturbia,a great film with, again, a great looking female). But she cannot measure with Megan, who is maybe the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. at the half of the movie, I wanted to marry her.It is also good to see that director, Michael Bay, put a lot of humor in the movie, and Anthony Anderson and John Torturo was charged for that segment. Yhe film also has some famous veterans, such as John Voight, bu also some very young and talented actors, like LeBouf himself and that soldier guy with wife and kid (I forgot his name).All in all, the best movie, the hottest girls and our favorite heroes - Transformers. Enjoy, it's a ""must-see"" movie. Twice :-)","Sep 8, 2007",10,/10
"This movie blew me away. My heart was racing throughout the entire movie. My eyes were glued to the screen. It was a good ride. The story line, the characters, dialogue, the intense and phenomenal fight scenes, unequivocally, the best movie I've seen this summer. I could not take my eyes off the screen =) I felt like I was 7 years old again playing with the ""Autobots"", ""Dinobots"", and ""Decepticons"". I watched the cartoon, so this did bring back some childhood memories. Awesome. This is a movie that I will add to the collection. My heart is still racing. I called a friend of mine as soon as I got out the movie, he'd just seen it as well, we both couldn't stop talking about it. A great movie.","Jul 7, 2007",10,/10
"... a lot of the dialogue seemed very forced and malplaced. And to be honest, I don't think I've seen a film that gave me the feeling of getting such a heavy load of ""America"" crammed down my throat. GM/Ford along with the military must have paid loads to this movie. But the worst part, having seen Die Hard 4.0 before Transformers, where the execution of the plot seems remotely possible (not counting the whole Autobots thing against, of cause), and knowing they made two movies in one. A great action movie, and some low humor ""American Pie 'Insert number'"". And so damn long. Let's see some more action, not a robot escaping off of a bridge, determined that is has to be done in near slow motion.","Jul 8, 2007",4,/10
"Transformers gets my vote for best movie for the summer of 07. Now, I was skeptical when I first heard of this movie. I was holding on to the memories of childhood; playing with the toys (we totally had Optimus Prime!), loving the cartoon, crying at the animated movie (Autobots died?! What?!) I planned to boycott, to moan about Hollywood snagging and ruining my childhood. Then I saw the preview and heard the sound. If you ever watched Transformers, you know what I mean. The awesome 'transforming' sound. And it's there. In the movie. And so is Peter Cullen, the original voice for Optimus Prime. So I went and I watched and I fell for the Transformers all over again. Optimus Prime was calm, and yet bad ass. Like a Kurosawa samurai. The Decepticons were mean and...deceptive. And yes, I got a little blurry eyed when the Autobots gathered. Shut up. This movie is great because it really is a story with good guys and bad guys. And the writers stayed away from ""stupid US government gangs up on all Transformers, good or bad."" Which was good, because I hate when alien movies go all ""Mac and Me"". I thought the effects were great, and didn't do too much of the quick jump edits that action movies insist on using today, and that give me such a headache. They even do some stuff in slow-mo, which is effective. Of course, some people are mad because Bumblebee was a Camaro and not a VW Bug. Well, talk to VW, people, because they had their chance and they said no. And sorry, the Camaro is SWEET!! Deal. Without GM,you wouldn't have movie at all to complain about on IMDb, then you'd have to live productive lives, and no on wants that. Some people are also 'upset' that the robots don't look exactly as they did in the cartoons. These are the same people that wanted the X-Men running around in brightly colored Lycra, so I'm ignoring them. All in all, I'd go see it again, and at $6.50 a pop for a matinée, that's saying something. Sure, it's not going to change the world, but it sure is fun to watch.","Jul 9, 2007",9,/10
"This movie was fine... It deviated far too much from the original transformers concepts for me to really enjoy it. It could have easily been just a war movie, with the occasional giant robot. The special effects and acting were on par with most movies of a similar budget. If you're just looking for an action movie, you'll probably enjoy this. If you're a die hard fan, you'll want to see it so that you can complain about what they've done. This film is basically plagued by the same pitfalls as many video game and TV show to film translations; The filmmakers have banked on name recognition to bring credibility to a movie that bears little resemblance to it's original inspiration.","Jul 6, 2007",5,/10

"I was eager to see this movie since I am familiar with the old animation version which I don't remember quite well. I'm writing this comment 10 minutes after seeing the movie. I can only say that it's one of my favorite movies. I'm not a true fan of sci-fi or genres alike, perhaps because I am a girl, but this movie just took my breath away. The robots were exquisitely rendered, the transformation was flawless and fascinating. I could not stop feeling that tension throughout the movie. It just kept me there and did not bore me at all, not for a second. There were some very funny moments in the movie which made me laugh sincerely and I do not usually laugh when watching movies because I usually find the humor too dumb. However, here it was different. I did not expect such humorous moments but they were well-balanced and gave me a great pleasure. I saw some bad comments about the movie, stating that it is for morons and I strongly disagree with such statements. Everybody has their opinion and view and they can judge for themselves. The movie is a must see for this year. I truly recommend it to all people of all ages - it is a great entertaining movie.","Jul 21, 2007",10,/10

"You'd have to be either a child, or an adult with the IQ level of a shower curtain to enjoy this movie. Here's what's wrong with it: **It's tries waaay too hard to be ""cool,"" hip, and current to our culture. It ends up mocking itself and fails miserably. There's never ANY sense of danger or drama at all, it's all just a happy, cheerful display of moving machines.**It made me sick to my stomach how literally 30 seconds could NOT go by without some character in the movie making some lame ass childish joke. I'm not exaggerating, 60 consecutive seconds could not go by without something moronic happening. It really bothers me that some dude made the conscious decision to have this movie be riddled with stupid, idiotic, 'teen' humor.**Did it bother anyone else at how relatively easy it was for the humans to capture and restrain the Transformers? **I hated the sense that the first half of the movie was the ""story,"" and the second half was just like, ""ok, now time for the action."" **Has the typical useless girl character who ends up being completely insignificant in the final parts of the movie, yet they spent so much time on her in the first half. She plays ZERO role at the end. Then again I guess it's better to have her do nothing, than give her a clichéd role of coming up behind some bad guy and saving the hero or something similar. And speaking of her, as usual, the movie makers obviously only care about appearance, since that girl couldn't act at all. Look at the moment(s) where she encounters the Transformers. Instead of looking shocked and in complete disbelief at seeing a several story tall live robot, she has the same expression you would have if you saw someone at work, who you previously could've sworn had the day off, but you see them at work anyway. She had that SAME subtle look.**I'll say one positive thing for once, the main character, who I also liked in Disturbia, has good energy to him and seems to have a knack for comedic timing. He's the only person who I DIDN'T want to shoot after seeing this piece of crap.**I haven't wondered this hard about ""what they were thinking"" since I first heard Wakka's voice acting from Final Fantasy 10.","Jul 28, 2007",1,/10

"This has to be one of the most disappointing films I have seen this year. I had heard some really bad reviews for transformers but I went to see it anyway. Boy did I regret it. First of all the script was very weak. Secondly there was no heart in it, the Megan Fox/ Shia Lebeouf love story had potential but was under used. Thirdly they should have just focused on one city rather than show the transformers turning up in Iraq too (I think it was Iraq but not sure). It was all a bit disjointed.Now onto the positives(actually I mean positive). The transformers looked really cool and there were one to two good action sequences.To me Transformers just looked like a barrage of action sequences put hazily together with no soul in it. Miss this one, there are better summer blockbusters to watch, like for instance Live free and Die hard.","Nov 10, 2007",4,/10
"The film begins with a mysterious helicopter heading unceasingly towards a military base. It's pilot is warned what will happen if it keeps coming bit still it comes. Upon landing it lands at the base it ""Transforms"" into one of the Decepticon and proceeds to destroy the military base, with little to no resistance from the troops who are ill-equipped to deal with such raw power, only one small team of soldiers make it out. Skip to high school dweeb Sam Witwicky's show and tell in which he reveals his grandfather was an explorer who went mad and started to ranting about a giant iceman, after getting an A for his presentation he is taken by his Dad to buy his first car, a yellow Camero. After witnessing his car driving off and later getting attacked by another vehicle, Sam discovers that the transforming robots that masquerade as cars are in a desperate quest to find the all-spark before Megatron the leader of the Decepticons.In the hands of another director this may have become just another toy advert but Michael Bay turns it into a tour-De-force as the Transformers are as real as anything in our world, their metal shining and reflecting exactly as it should creating an illusion that is almost perfect. By being extremely smart and using as much real world stuff as he could, it means that we know that what we are watching is not some stuff that looks like it came off of a Playstation 3 game like in Indy 4 but instead were watching something real unfold, even when we know it is not.The script does exactly the job it should of telling the story as well as it can with humour, passion, and yes even drama, as you genuinely worry about the robots as much as the humans, unlike so many other empty blockbusters that use over-hype to create a buzz and are rigged merely to sell merchandise, you always feel that in this film the story is the thing and if they do well with the merchandise, well that's a bonus. This is a big stepping stone in the right direction, if you want to sell more toys, make a better film! But for me the next thing of serious note are the actors, everyone of which takes everything they do seriously, which makes this film so believable. There are no dreadful looks to camera, no knowing nods to a post-modern world and even lines that you would think would fall on their ass like ""Gentlemen. I'd like to introduce you to my friend, Optimus Prime!"" actually works, when you would think that they wouldn't. Shia Le Beouf (Apologies for spelling) is magnificent as Sam Witwicky and he performs every scene like his life depends on it. His performance is an assured one that will almost guarantee that he becomes a star, after all he has been doing this for years. The rest of the cast do a great job with Megan Fox having little to do other than look nice, but with Anthony Anderson doing particularly well as the comic relief (He is great at that).Films should always try and take us to places we may not have been and experience things we have never experienced, be it a perilous climb up the side of a building (safety last), a world of criminal corruption and secrets (LA Confidential), or a world of giant robots that are seeking an all-powerful cube.For those who think that this is a terrible blockbuster I would say watch GI Joe before you are so quick to criticise this cracker.","May 4, 2011",8,/10

"During the whole buzz that no one could miss leading to the opening, I thought ""Oh, not another comics-turned-into-movie! Where will they stop?!?"" But I saw the previews last week and was instantly hooked. So I went to see it on the big screen, the day it opened here in Shanghai (yesterday). Well, I have to admit, I am looking forward to seeing it again. See, it's so full of details, it's so fast, it's so OUT THERE, special FX are rich and seamless, I just couldn't take everything in. Plus, I hadn't been to a movie theater in more than 7 months, so I was really blown away. I was a fan as a kid, and I am not disappointed by the movie. The Transformers and Hasbro have definitely secured the next generation's follow up. On a down note, watching the movie, I kept thinking ""Any second now, they're going to show a larger-than-life US banner floating in the wind"" ... Sure, it wasn't as thick as in other films of the same caliber. So I finally gave it an 8...","Jul 11, 2007",8,/10

"Before I speak on the film I must say that I was never a Michael Bay fan. On several occasions I've even said that he is the worst director in the history of film. After seeing Transformers, however, I can see why he started making films, and more importantly, why he should keep making films. This film is more then just a loud, dumb, uninspired action movie; It's an edge of your seat, balls to the wall thrill ride that hits the ground running and never stops. It also may be the best argument for the use of CGI in films, as this is one of the best looking films ever made and could not have been made without the use of cutting-edge technology. Michael Bay uses the technology(and the 150+ million dollar budget) in the most amazing ways possible. This movie is truly an astounding cinematic vision come to life and everyone should experience it.","Jul 9, 2007",10,/10

What are your thoughts? Did you enjoy, or were you disappointed? The visual effects were amazing, Think i'll go and watch this again at cinema sometime soon, maybe I'm sad spending my money twice but i think its worth it lol. :-)Anyone know of a sequel? I hope there is and hopefully will be just as good if not better. Oh and another thing, there's some cool cars in that film lol. So i'm going to have to give this film a 9 out of 10 rating!

Boy, the man doesn't disappoint. The action scenes were impressive, the actors were good and the CGI was top notch. I also have to say that just like her last name, Megan is a ""Fox""!! Of course some people are going to kill the movie because of the script, clichés, etc., but when I go to see an action movie I expect to be entertained, which the movie does from beginning to end. Usually in movies that run over two hours, you have lull moments, but that was not the case in ""Transformers"". I can't wait for the DVD and I will be first in line when ""Transformers 2"" comes out. I give it a 9 out of 10 (I gave it a 10 to boost it up).","Jul 13, 2007",10,/10

Definitely THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SAT THROUGH. CRAP CRAP CRAP.And I was actually a huge transformers fan growing up.

"To call this movie anything other than astounding is absurd. I went into this movie as a true fan of the original Transformers. The special effects and overall development of the actual Transformer's characters was done brilliantly. I must say that the level of humor and child-like moments throughout the movie were disappointing, but every movie has it's downsides. I was truly amazed at the level taken to visually capture the transformation of the characters when turning into there various cars and plane counterparts. I was also happy that for the people who didn't know about Transformers the movie did a great job of explaining and also visually showing what was going on. A must see.","Jul 5, 2007",8,/10
A few short weeks ago I only associated Transformers with some sort of action figures my older brother played with when we were kids. So originally when I heard they were making a real life movie about this comic series I had not inclination to see it. But when a lot of my friends and family raved over the movie including the storyline and special effects I decided to check it out. Going into the movie I did not have high expectations and would have laughed if someone predicted that I would leave the theater with such an appreciation for talking robots sent to earth. Yet I found myself almost crying over Bumblebee and wanting to go by an Optimus Prime when I left. The script and storyline were great as they were directed at the older audience who grew up with these endearing robotic heroes.,"Aug 1, 2007",3,/10

To the producers, I take my hat of to you! Not only were the actual robots were brought to life in spectacular fashion but there were so many action packed scenes that the movie was not boring at any moment. I absolutely found the movie thoroughly entertaining and loved the little dish of teenage humor on the side, even the older ladies in the cinema laughed at a certain crack from Sam's mother after she'd had a few drinks!

"I saw the new movie Transformers few days ago here in my country of Finland. In the theater was a handful of people including myself in the early of the week. First of all this is a totally Action/Sci-Fi movie and nothing cartoon in this film. Only the characters from the popular Transformers series are brought on the screens with modern technology and good awesome great special effects. I'm a big movie watcher. I have expectations of this movie. I saw episodes of the Transformers cartoon series which was show on television and i heard there's a movie of it coming later. I was very surprised it really got to hold me on the edge of my seat. The actors played really well 9 points for that.The beginning was a bit slow, but overall it was all but best action i've seen so far. When Sam Witwicker (Shia LeBeouf) the main character tells the class he's grandfather searched the cube in the ice. Later Sam was not aware that he's life about to change. The robots came in the planet of earth and search for a code on the grandpa's glasses. I must describe that there were a planet called (the IMDb suggest other so i clear it). Deceptions get the auto-bots to the planet earth. The auto-bot leader Optimus Prime has excellent/more sound voice that I've seen so far in the movies and definitely impressed me by it's creepiness and give me the chills. My favorite characters were Optimus Prime, Ironhide and Megatron. That's all i'm going to reveal because you'll have to see the movie.Especially the entrance of the robots is something that special effects hasn't influence me before so much. When the film ended my hand was like half hour stiff because of the excitement. The hand was OK later. I recommend it to all, but as the character Optimus Prime says Quote: ""unwise"" don't bring your under 12 year old to theaters. I saw youngsters in front of me when i was in theater they hold hands across the face in some parts. Some hold a bag in front her so it wouldn't be so scary. I'd say if you are a movie or action fan you definitely would not be disappointed when you see this. It's awesome film. My favorite of all.","Jul 11, 2007",10,/10
"Michael Bays toy based block buster is a lot like a transformer itself.On the surface it appears to be a fun action film, but when you sit down to watch it, it transforms into something else- a moronic, product placement pushing remake of independence day, where giant robots replace giant space ships.Though the transformers franchise has its own universe and mythology, the live action movie throws it all out of the window and replaces it with a mid nineties disaster movie formula: Tons of clichéd, underdeveloped characters, holey and illogical plotting as well as unintentional laughs.A big problem with the movie is its frustrating sense of priority: the transformers are supposed to be the main attraction of the movie and yet the film devotes most of its time to an annoyingly bloated cast of characters who don't have any real impact over the plot and really aren't worth giving a damn about. The transformers are reduced to being clumsy machines who destroy stuff and say funny one liners which is just wrong because its their movie, not the U.S military's - save that stuff for G.I. Joe ! As to be expected, the visual effects are amazing: the autobots and the decepticons look spectacular. Even when they are doing something as mundane as talking to each other, optimus prime and co look very realistic. As great as the transformers look though, you'll have trouble seeing them at times and that leads to what is unexpectedly but undoubtedly the biggest fault of the movie: the action . Transformers is an ACTION movie based on ACTION figures, directed by an ACTION movie director and yet the films action is surprisingly crappy. The moment it looks like a big battle is gonna kick off, wobbly camera shots and hyper fast ADD editing just distract you from whats going on . Movies like king kong (2005), and Hulk made sure that their action sequences featuring giant battling behemoths were exciting and easy to see- why couldn't transformers do the same thing? It boggles the mind to think about how badly bay missed the mark on this one.","Dec 15, 2007",1,/10
"Like the title said it really is, forget LOTR, The Matrix, Harry Potter, or whatever other film ever made, this was absolutely incredible, I literally was in disbelief as I left the cinema tonight.Words cannot describe how good this film is, the CGI is quite literally mind blowing and completely overwhelming, It was so good I was almost in tears from being so immensely overwhelmed.This film is easily the film of the year, in fact this decade, most probably of all time, Bring on T2.You MUST go and see this film, don't assume it's not going to be good because it's a kids film, because it really isn't, although im sure kids would like it, the sheer brilliance of this film will blow any audience away","Jul 21, 2007",10,/10
"I must have been watching a different film to the other people commenting about this trash. As soon as the 'comedy' scenes started I felt nauseus. The painful 'love' story between the two leads was barely believable and The Transformers, well, they were made from so many special effects you couldn't tell who was who and you didn't care. The actual storyline was about some artefact that needed to get put into something, I can't really remember, I was losing the will to live and every five minutes I was telling my friend we should leave. If Micheal Bay had a heart he would announce a live press conference and quit the film industry.

Everything is wrapped up very well, it all fits into place.I went to see this movie with great doubt, recent highly anticipated movies I saw were all big let downs, Spiderman 3 and Xmen 3 were blow outs, Superman Returns and Batman Begins failed to go off the ground.I am happy to say that this movie finally breaks the barrier and delivers greatness.","Jul 12, 2007",10,/10
"I'll never forget going to see the original 'Transformers; The Movie' in the late eighties and loving it then. Of course back then only cartoons could create such a title. 20 years later I could not realise how a tiny little piece of my mind had been neglected for so long. As the film progressed it woke that part of me that loves the story, the characters and all the action. Lets face it, Transformers are for the kid in all of us, the person that rates this badly has turned their back on that child. I however, have not.So firstly, The cast of this film aren't amazing but Shia LaBeouf is a real character in this show. I've been a watcher of his for years and he is a naturally funny guy and a great choice for Sam. Having said that, its not about humans further than Sam. The Transformers are all without a doubt spectacular and created with such care and detail. I have never witnessed graphics of this nature on film or even on computer. Its simply a masterpiece as far as computer graphics go.If I could change one thing in this film it would be the 'Armageddon' style music and camera work. They are 2 different films and should remain so. I felt a little let down by that but given the highs of this film the lows were leagues below.If you are reading this and deliberating watching this stop reading and get it immediately. I will actually buy a HD TV and HD Video with surround sound just to play this title in HD and call it money well spent. God I cant wait for the next one.","Jul 13, 2007",10,/10
"I went to see the summer actioner called Transformers last night and that was before I read the headline from Variety Online (see below):'TRANSFORMERS' DOMINATES BOX OFFICE Robots set seven-day record Transformation complete. Quickly rising to become a summer hit, DreamWorks and Paramount's robot actioner ""Transformers"" scored the best seven-day showing for a nonsequel in history, clobbering previous record holder ""Spider-Man.""End Variety piece ***************************************************I am a self-described movie buff meaning that the purview of my movie watching covers a wide swath of land from Dumb and Dumber to Glengarry Glen Ross. Thus, it is and was, that I looked forward to catching this movie and predicted to anyone that would listen that it would be the best action movie of the summer. (""Best action movie of the summer"" is like saying ""tallest player of the basketball team"" and does not necessarily mean the best movie of the summer.)And it delivered. Apparently, as can be deduced from the Variety headline, others agree with me. Of course, the first question that came to this mind as I considered plunking down the hard-earned coin for a kids movie was: how can a cartoon (Hollywood has put out a few of these recently.) transcend all of the baggage that usually drags these movies into the predictable and, hence unwatchable, zone?Perhaps, it was the iconoclastic touch of director Michael Bay who, no conservative by a long shot, is nonetheless scorned by the Hollywood elite because of his identification with the fly-over set's aesthetics. Or maybe, relatedly, it was the mostly positive portrayal of the American military and DoD in an era when the media seems hellbent on vilifying anything in camouflage. Maybe the opening scene which - doing exactly what an opening scene is supposed to do - grabs you by the throat and sets the bar very high for the rest of the film, and then, by consistently matching the standard set for itself, allows you to settle in and enjoy the ride. Or maybe the choice of ideal leading characters in the ideal sense of Platonic forms. Not that the film was perfect. It is, after all, just a summer sprint along the beach, and ironically, I thought that the denouement was predictable and banal. But the first hour-and-a-half ride was an above average romp full of laughs and impossible situations punctuated by popcorn-dropping special effects.","Jul 9, 2007",9,/10

"I'm just simply going to say that this is probably THE best summer blockbuster movie of all time. I'm a child of the 80's and had two-dozen G1 transformers growing up and can easily say without hesitation - Transformer fans and Mike Bay haters, you have absolutely NO reason to bash this film. I'm not a huge Mike Bay fan myself. I just saw the film with a group of friends (Mike Bay bashers and huge Transformer fans themselves), and we all agreed that Mike Bay just redeemed himself and delivered in every way imaginable. Optimus Prime has lips? The nerve! I had my doubts, yes, but once you see the human factor in him because of it, you'd want him no other way. Besides, when his mask is up, you know sh!t's gonna get crazy. I love it. And the emotion they give to Bumblebee tugs at your heart. Anyway, the projector broke during the climactic fight and was down for about 10 min. We picked up where we left off and the ending was worth the wait. Holy Jesus. We all got free passes afterward and the 4 other guys that went with me all agreed - when we can use 'em, we'll use 'em to see this movie again. To put it simply: It's THAT GOOD. Well-written comedy (no really bad one-liners for a change), brief romance (which usually rode shotgun to the comedy thanks to Bumblebee), unimaginable animation and compositing, insane action sequences, and the Transformers get so much screen time, they should be nominated for a supporting actor(s) Oscar. Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox (oh is she ever) have great screen chemistry but Shia (aside from the TF's) really stole the show - definitely one to watch out for. For almost three hours, I was 11 years old all over again rootin' hard for the good guys - and so was everyone else in the theater. I've never heard a crowd get into a movie as much as this. Laughter, cheers, ""Oohs"", ""Dohs"", and clapping surrounded me throughout the show. Hands down - BEST movie going experience EVER. Dad, can I see it again??? Wow.","Jul 2, 2007",8,/10

"First off any one who says this was a good movie is a paid employee, a moron, under twelve, or just likes to see anything thats shiny and moves really fast and cool. I'm a movie and transformers fan and I've seen enough films to know when something is pure garbage. This movie is not a bad transformers movie, its just a bad movie. If your a transformers fan save your money or go buy the 1986 transformer film. It's sad when an over twenty year old cartoon movie has a better story ,characters, and designs than a 150 million dollar block buster. Michael Bay is as out of touch as Spielberg(I still love the Berg) and neither probably has ever watched a good anime or a 80's cartoon and has no idea what cool or quality is at this point in time. I liked Bad Boys and Armageddon so I know Bay can make entertaining films but this just wasn't the one for him. I'm not surprised by the results especially from a guy who thought Raiders of the Lost Ark would be a failure. The problem with many directors who are attached to many comic and cartoon movie projects is that they have no respect for the source material and in their ignorance they fail to see that the reason that these franchises still have strong fan bases is because the original creators did something right. All film makers and producers should remember this ""everything is not a hit"". So, don't be so quick to dismiss the fundamental elements of any franchise especially if it doesn't particularly resonate with you.Note To Spielberg: STOP SLAPPIN YO NAME ON EVERYTHING, YOUR ONE OF THE GODS MAN!!!!!!","Jul 4, 2007",3,/10

"This movie gave me goosebumps the whole way through. Yes I watched Transformers as a child and the movie still blew me away. My only gripe is it left me wanting even more. They can make Harry Potter movies and LoTR 4 hours long(and they were terrible) but a movie I enjoyed cut off when I was crying for more!One thing I really don't understand about all these other ""critiques"" is that all they do is compare Transformers now to Transformers back then. The movie is edgy, interesting, action-packed, and hilarious. The TV show (if you watch it now) is complete crap with colors done wrong or voices done with the wrong characters. Get used to it people this movie is going to make some serious bank. I took a few friends of mine to the sneak preview when it hit America on the 28th of June and EVERYONE in the movie theater left with a sense of satisfaction. I bet you complained that Jean Grey's hair in Xmen was not red enough. To these people I say grow up, things are not the same since you were a child. Some things you watched when you were a child would not work as a live action movie. All ranting aside I really have to say the character Sam was extremely likable and Mikeala was attractive and interesting. The whole movie theater was dead silent watching the awesome fights and even cheered for 20 mins when the movie was over.I hope the second one is as good as this one was. Micheal Bay you have out done yourself.And thank God there was no emo dancing.","Jul 6, 2007",9,/10
"Seriously, it's nearly impossible for me to start watching a movie and not finish it. I've watched millions of movies that people consider to be terrible...yet I find some redeeming quality in the film and consider it to have been worth watching. Prior to turning on the Transformers movie on cable, I had only walked out of one movie in my life (Flesh and Bone...circa 1995-ish). This movie however...um...I could only watch about 30 minutes and then had to change the channel. I made it through an hour of Flesh and Bone. I loved the Transformers cartoon as a kid, and I was leery about a movie adaptation because...how do you make a high-budget sci-fi movie from an admittedly cheesy concept? The only good thing that came from the resurgence of the Transformers brand in my opinion are these Xip3 Transformer jackets from a company called Core Gear. While transforming robots from outer-space are pretty far-fetched, a hiking jacket that turns into a back-pack that turns into a pillow...well that's at least functional and kinda cool (see the jackets http://budurl.com/transf ), and if you're a raving Transformers fan, there are limited edition Transformers-logo jackets available for sale.","Dec 11, 2010",2,/10

"Even though I am not a big fan of comic book adaptations, and I avoided to be taken in by the release of this movie for first few weeks, however later I decided to check it out, it had amazing ratings on IMDb and most of the times they are very accurate.But I must tell you that I am not an American and hadn't heard about any comics that went by ""Transformers"" it was totally a new concept for me. And was I disappointed !! I simply failed to make any sense of the movie, then I thought it might a no brainer and decided to concentrate on action sequences and special effects, however I was not able to understand what exactly was happening. My mind simply went numb. The robots were so complicated in design that I was not able to make what they were trying to do. The scenes seemed to be too much crowded and complicated, it was difficult to comprehend who was doing what.Maybe this movie is working because of the fans that it got from the comics and earlier adaptation, otherwise I don't see any other reason for it to be just any other movie on the block.So for the sake for Die-hard fans, I sincerely hope that producers would put in more effort on story and screenplay rather than special effects, when they come out with the second installment, which I am sure that they will, given all the commercial success this one got.","Oct 2, 2007",5,/10
"I watched transformers in the early eighties. I loved the series as a kid, so naturally I feared that the movie would belittle the epic battle that is going on between the two opposing forces. Fortunately this isn't so.This movie is meant to be entertainment and nothing else. The writers didn't try to embrace any deeper philosophical standpoints which would have been nearly impossible with so little screen time available. Thumbs up!The visual effects are NICE and very dynamic and the sound is awesome - when Barricade bellows ""ARE YOU LADIESMAN217?"" the whole theater trembled. (Yes, the theater, not the people inside the theater, it wasn't a metonym).""What about the plot?"" - you say. Well... It's a war-movie: ""Search and destroy"".I have a 7 year old kid who has watched the G1 series on DVD and has collected Transformers action figures since the age of 3. I am VERY pleased that his introduction to non-animated Transformers is through this movie. The very thought takes me back to when my dad took me to see Return of the Jedi in 1983.A new shiny version of a known universe has just popped into existence.","Aug 6, 2007",10,/10
"A fantastic film from start to finish. it featured some of the best special effects i have ever seen, while the storyline was kept simple to understand but nevertheless grabbing your interest throughout by supplying endless scenes of action entwined with moments of humour. A must see for transformers fans as it can be related to the animated series as well as a great movie for action lovers as it has been modernised and knocked up a notch so it's suitable for almost an age. The end of the film leaves you for hungry for more, finding yourself reliving the moments in your head throughout th next day. The cinema is definitely recommended for the optimal experience rather than waiting for the DVD(unless you are fortunate enough to have a huge T.V and surround sound).","Aug 1, 2007",10,/10
"Okay, I just read a comment on the new Transformers movie on this website that said that Transformers the Movie sucked. Do not believe the bitch who wrote that. And to her: When your husband left the room he could've left to a bar or a stripper house. If he was in the house he could've left to another room to watch porn or masturbate. Also Read!!!!!!!!!!! Go to Barnes and Nobles and get The Transformers Movie Prologue book which I know you haven't. If you did get it you obviously don't read. In the movie Sam's father didn't die. They got him out. If you had gotten and read the prologue you wouldv'e known that they took him to an insane asylum. You didn't just need to read the book to know this. In the beginning of the movie when Sam is doing his show-and-tell presentation he says, ""Unfortunately he wound up going insane and dying."" This tells you that he didn't die, or else he couldn't have gone insane. Any moron with a brain could've found that out. Dee-dee-dee","Nov 6, 2007",10,/10
"I heard it was better than expected so I gave it a shot. For anyone under the age of 21, this may be better suited; however, for anyone that has seen way too many of the tired movie clichés that this movie dragged me through, it's pretty hard to take.In fairness, I did appreciate that the film held my interest and tried at times to not take itself too seriously. Only problem is that when humans are painted with such broad strokes as to use them as stereotypes for aggrandizing the aliens, it appeals to the lowest level of intelligence. Of course, the film (as of this writing) averages 7.5 stars so maybe that level of intelligence isn't too off the mark. But whatever...Expected impressive digital animation and one laugh (the scene with the interrogator catching the bottle of dog medicine without looking was pretty cool). Otherwise, the usual corporate Hollywood fare.","May 26, 2008",4,/10
"A load of fun this movie delivers as it hits the big screen. With the amazing CGI effects and a list of fresh cast, much is to be expected of this film.This film will entertain most movie goers. The action does not disappoint, with the robots transforming as they are drifting, running etc etc. One never gets sick of watching their transformation. I bet my 2 huge nuts most people will not be able to leave the theater without gushing excitedly about the movie and reminisce about it. The quick-witted jokes gives the movie many laughing moments.The plot is simple and easily understood however it does not feel ""enough"". The satisfaction of having a strong plot was not felt in it. There are some scenes whereby the mood of the movie switches between the serious and ridiculous. For people who are totally unfamiliar to transformers, they may not be able to keep up on which robots are which as the fight scenes are very fast-paced.In short, serious movie goers who pays attention to the story and are easily upset by small details would most definitely dislike the movie and find the jokes lame. However, if one just likes pure fun with a make-do storyline (as i am), the movie will rock! I for one will be re watching this movie an exaggerated number of times when it comes out on DVD!8.5/10. and a whole lot of entertainment it brings!PS: Won't hurt to know the robots and their names before watching the movie","Jul 8, 2007",8,/10
"I found myself liking the first third of Transformers and being completely disengaged with the film after that.I think that the best choice Michael Bay has made in his entire film career was putting Shia LaBeouf in the lead role of this film. I'm not going to swear to this, but I felt like he was improvising at least half of his dialogue. Which is great, because the screenplay was not very interesting at all. I found myself enjoying everything that LaBeouf's characters said more than any other part of the movie. He's funny, quirky, and, surprisingly, a decent actor. I first saw his work in Holes and then again in Disturbia. I must say that I feel like LaBeouf is on his way to making some really excellent work in the future.Megan Fox, on the other hand, was less than satisfying. Everyone has been talking about how pretty she is and, yes, I think that's the only reason she was in the film. Her character was completely unnecessary to the story and could have been taken out entirely. But, instead, the audience gets about a thousand shots of her ""looking hot"" and very few shots of her actually doing anything important with the story. Still, even though I don't think she's a very good actress, I had to admit that her acting was still much better than Liv Tyler's in Armageddon or Kate Beckinsale's in Pearl Harbor. She's not a *bad* actress, but she doesn't offer any meat to the story beyond being a love interest for LaBeouf's character.As for the character development in general, I didn't see any. Unsurprisingly. I didn't expect any, and I didn't get any. But, here's my biggest issue with that: these robots should be interesting. But they aren't. These robots probably make up for most of my criticism with this film. The special effects were really good (*really* good), but the robots were astonishingly bland. And I thought they looked ugly. Believe it or not, I thought there was *too* *much* detail to them. There were so many chunks of metal sticking off of them that it made them all hard to recognize. Yes, that was a big complaint I had with the film. Except for two of the robots, they all looked the same! I had no idea what robots I should be rooting for during the fight scenes. I felt like they all were Megatron fighting Megatron. The only two robots I could recognize were the yellow one and Optimus Prime. And that's only because they were different colors from the other robots. I mean, this was not a very good-*looking* film. That surprised me, because Bay's films are at least fairly decent with the art direction, but not here. The colors were too saturated in some places, but not when it came to the robots. And, like I said, all the robots looked the same to me.And I wasn't very impressed with the action sequences either. I felt like there wasn't enough coherence to it. It was a lot of stomping around and not a whole lot of anything else. And the action starts about halfway through the movie and doesn't stop until the film's over. The rest of the characters in this movie, apart from LaBeouf and the robots, didn't really serve a purpose for the story. There were a few characters who I didn't even know why they were getting screen time. The movie dips in and out of the main plot line at a ridiculous rate. There's an interrogation scene for two characters. I was confused because I had no idea what purpose they were serving. I didn't know why the scene was even in the film.If I had to sum up Transformers, it would be that there was a lot of decent effects surrounding incoherent action sequences, ugly robots that looked the same, useless characters, little plot, cheap dialogue, and not much else. This is Michael Bay's best film, but that's not saying much since I hated his other films.3/10","Sep 15, 2010",3,/10

The Best Movie Of The Year !!!!! Really... I saw during the premiere!! Our country Malaysia is one of the first country in the world to watch it and I am one of the first who watch the first screening here. From the very first minutes until the end the movie was fantastic. The movie was pack with action and have very unique fighting styles. Some are mind blowing.. The storyline also are well written and flow on smoothly. There are also funny moment in this movie. So anyone out there who give bad critics about this movie before seeing it.. I say back off.. I can say that this movie are way better than Spiderman 3.. And far far way better than pirates of Caribbean: World End... and maybe better than Lord Of The Ring.. So guys and girls.. GO now and watch the movie.. I (and other peoples who already watch this) give a solid rating of 10/10 star!!!! Hail Transformers!!!!,"Jun 30, 2007",10,/10

"If Spielberg hadn't put reins on Bay it could've been significantly worse.This was the coolest thing ever to me as a kid. Now that my film brain has evolved, and since I'm fully capable of forgoing the nostalgia goggles, I can see the movie for what it is.I can't help but wonder what this movie would be like if Spielberg helmed the entire thing, and if Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman hadn't written it. (Eagle Eye, Star Trek: Into Darkness, The Mummy (2017), and The Amazing Spider-Man 2.) There are moments in this movie where it feels kind of awe-inspiring in terms of music and presentation. Like when Sam and Michaela meet the Autobots. It could've been an epic sci-fi adventure like Jurassic Park. And if a better writer had been attached, the characters would've been better-realized and a lot more likable. Like what if James Gunn wrote it? Seems like something he could pull off, especially nowadays.The story has a bunch of plotholes.There's a lot of bad dialogue.Perverted camera angles.Sam has plot-armor for centuries.The characters aren't well-developed or particularly likable. Some are straight-up annoying.The pacing sucks.There's a little bit of racism. ""We don't speak Spanish.""There's a totally unnecessary subplot with a hot Australian hacker. (Honestly surprised Bay didn't shoot her like a sex object.)A lot of the comedy doesn't land.The acting isn't the best.The way Bay shoots product placement is incredibly annoying.Also, personal point, I hate that they gave Optimus lips. Even when I was a kid I didn't like that. I prefer just the faceplate.All that said, these special effects hold up extraordinarily well! It's probably going to be a long time before the movie starts showing its age.The Decepticons and Autobots are all cool and have neat designs--mostly. Some have more personality than others but the ones that do are fun. (The DS games gave the Decepticons more personality.) I think more could've been done with all of them. The concept of Barricade-the police car-is kind of scary.Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving are both great, but that's not a surprise at all.The action scenes are very entertaining!The music is great!When the Autobots were goofing around the Witwicky property, that was kinda funny.There is some beautiful cinematography!You really feel like the humans are there with the Transformers.","Jul 3, 2023",3,/10

"This film's biggest crime is being mistitled. The proper tile of this film should have been...HUMANS! (featuring some Transformers)Beyond being mistitled and not what any Transformers fan would ever have wanted out of a Transformers film, the plot is basically garbage and the Transformers look awful, particularly their absurdly over-complicated transformations. (Compare them to the simple transformations in the original cartoons, where large portions of the vehicle become the robots such that you can clearly see which robot is which vehicle, even without the color clues.) The CGI action is so much nonsense crammed onto the screen at all once that it immediately becomes an incoherent blur. Random subplots with inconsequential humans fighting inconsequential Transformers were a time-waster.The only positive things I can remember from this film where the gratuitous but iconic shots of Megan Fox, who this film introduce to the world. (A mixed blessing, to be sure, but we all appreciated the view at the time.) Shia LaBeouf's character was obnoxious in the extreme, start to finish. Oh, and the racial stereotype Transformers were something else.I will never understand how these things keep making money, as I'm aware that they get dumber with each iteration, but clearly it is me who is wrong, because make money they do, even with all the expensive CGI and big-name actors doing absolutely nothing in front of a green screen.","Nov 18, 2024",2,/10
"As a member of the group bearing the dubious distinction of the title, ""Baby Boomers,"" I caught the animated Transformers series at the end of what I call ""My Belated Youth."" I was a fan. When I got to know the story line and the characters, I was hooked. Now, I'm not here to tell you that the old animated Transformers series was the best thing on television, because it clearly wasn't. But what I AM here to tell you is that it was ONE of the best things on television...at least as far as the story went. I tend to hold the Transformers in the same light as ""V"", Battlestar Galactica, Dune, the Thundercats, Flight of the Navigator, the Last Starfighter, and the Masters of the Universe, all of vaguely the same period. These were the ""greats,"" and still collectively hold a special place in my heart.There were other, larger, more successful events such as Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, and the X-Men animated series, the Dark Knight animated series, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle phenomenon. And while these were hugely popular and imminently successful, the previously mentioned works are superior, in my opinion. They feature some of the same heart and some of the same style(s) but there is some element present, which connects to the humanity of me...oh, inimitable me...which none of the aforementioned works possess.Transformers carries with it the same hope for salvation most religions offer to us as a people. These are characters with a solid moral center, an other-worldly understanding of the cosmos and its implications/impact on the various life forms inhabiting it, and a sense of the greater good - salvation through redemption, redemption through action and personal responsibility. It carries non-human biological machines, which demonstrate individuality and presence of heart and such a strong moral center, as to render the mechanalities of their beings almost superfluous; cool, but unnecessary to the story.The present blockbuster counters that condition with even more humanity within the technological characters, which assists in creating more admirable characters, lends to the story a fluidity it may have otherwise lacked, and generates an appropriate level of suspense that was missing from the animated series.The visual effects are absolutely stupefying (that's a good thing) but of course they were...Spielberg knows how to put together some stunning visuals, which complement (rather than negate) the story itself. He is a Master of...Illusion (?). The pacing is great - we were never bored, even for a moment - and the story is richly executed.This is NOT the Transformers of my childhood. This is better - vastly better, and not due to the almost ethereal visuals, but because of the moral strength, the state of heart, and the gripping story to be found herein.Watch it. It will enamor you.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.","Jul 12, 2007",10,/10
"To this day, I remember the first Transformer my parents ever bought me. As a kid, I was a huge Transformers fan, and although I might be called a Transformers fanatic, let's not get that confused with ""fanboy."" It's like this: The people who give this movie a ""1"" rating are the same type of people who were mad that the X-Men didn't go into space and team up with aliens to fight Dark Phoenix - since, in 2007, that would have been dumb (granted, the movie didn't turn out much better than that, but still).As a movie, certain things have to be altered regarding the Transformers in order for it to work. Some people wanted a campy revisit of the 1980s, complete with Stan Bush and Weird Al songs. Well guess what, most people would have laughed at such a film and it would have been an embarrassment to anyone who went to see it, aside from that select few.Instead, here's what you get: Big robots who can turn into vehicles and such - they're aliens and they fight each other. That IS Transformers. Period.Don't listen to the whiners and nay-sayers, they probably downloaded a crappy quality version of the movie with a bittorrent client anyhow, instead of paying to see it, just before attempting to perform a movie critique in their traditional pseudo-intellectual style.Shia really shines in this film and even Fox's semi-competent acting doesn't really hold it back.

I do believe it could've been good but such terrible acting, direction, editing and casting made any redemption impossible. The one glimmer of hope was the acting of John Turturo. For me watching this movie was as if someone else was playing a computer game and I had to watch their go for over 2 hours before it was my turn. So many people seem to love this film and I honestly have no idea why. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and everyone has their own tastes and this isn't mine.

"So I went to the premiere of The Transformers last night, turned out my theater was the first in North America to see the film! The reel actually showed up in a combination lock for God sakes! Now I went into this film a fan of the Transformers, having watched the G1 and Beast Wars series' growing up, so I like the many in the theater with me sporting Autobot/Decepticon attire were gonna be a hard crowd to win over. Well lets just say it was the first time I have ever attended a movie where the audience actually applauded at the end.Now granted the story was a total tear down from the original series, but I felt it still was respectable to the franchise making the Allspark the cornerstone of the plot. There were great one-liners and comedic moments as well as little digs at itself such as when Shia's character accidentally mentions the ""More Than Meets The Eye"" slogan as he nervously talked to Meghan Fox's character and then says how stupid it was. There were even little lines made by Optimus and Megatron that paid homage to the original G1 series.As for the CGI, it has to be the best I have ever seen in a film thus far, making the interaction between the humans and Transformers totally seamless, and providing the platform for some of the greatest fight scenes in cinema history.Thank you Michael Bay!

"Last summer when I saw the very first teaser trailer that showed little more than the word ""Transformers"" I nearly lost my mind. I almost couldn't stand the one year wait, all the while people were posting blogs about Michael Bay ruining the Transformers that we all grew up with. They couldn't have been more wrong. Although some people who feel the need to find things wrong with perfectly good, entertaining and thrilling movies might say otherwise, my experience watching transformers couldn't have been better. Visually the movie was all I could have hoped for and more. I went in with no expectations as to a plot and I was thoroughly impressed with the story. If you, like me, grew up loving the Transformers then you will leave the theatre with after-glow. The first time during the film that one of the Transformers made that famous ""leap"" from standing into a car, the audience could not contain themselves. The transformations are top notch, I was amazed at the level of detail they were able to pull off.

Well, my entire family was in for quite a shock. I took my 14 year-old daughter, her friend, and my husband along, hoping for some good popcorn, at the best. As soon as the movie started, I was on for a ride that wouldn't quit. This movie takes you on an action journey that does not stop until two and a half hours later. The players were entirely believable, and the characters of the Transformers were extraordinary. I was not a Transformer fan growing up (Thundercat gal, here), and I am not a fan of action movies either; therefore, I was not really looking forward to this movie. I have NEVER enjoyed a movie like I did this one. There were too many fantastic scenes to name just one. Shia is a fantastic actor, and ALL of the roles were filled perfectly. This movie had something for everyone...action, special effects unseen before, drama, a love story, and humor.

This movie is far beyond what we have seen until now, and its a total new experience. I enjoyed watching it and I want to see it for the 2nd time. I was at the edge of my sit during the whole movie and to be honest, there are no words to describe this movie. The way to robots transformed and the battle between the autobots and the decepticons was very impressive. I loved the backyard scene, where they were trying to find the glasses.

There is a seen around the half way mark where they are searching through Sam's parent's house that is so painful and awkward I wanted to claw my own eyes out.The movie, thankfully, gets back on track towards the end of the film and aside from some extremely corny dialog is about the level I would expect from a movie about Transformers.","Jul 19, 2007",2,/10

Although, understandably, the focus is on the robots, the cast does a good job. A good dose of humor is also injected into the movie. I particularly love the cameo by Bernie Mac. There are also touching moments particularly those between Sam and Bumblebee.This movie is non-stop action from beginning to end. If you are an action fan, you won't be disappointed.

The war scene in the middle east was a great plus for the film, it gave the story more depth, action sequences were awesome,I couldn't even make question about why,where and when questions(unlike evan almighty which craps the story-line in the ending,why build an arc when only that part of the US is flooded,and there where hippo's and elephants??).Anyway this movie takes the cake for me,(move over ID4 this is my new favorite sci-fi movie),I just want to say Micheal Bay did a great job with the movie and a sequel would be great, considering there where a lot of robots not shown, it would be great to see the other bots in action, all-in all great movie!!! a sequel would be great too!!","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10
"With movies such as The Rock, Bad Boys, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and The Island, (not to mention Aquaman 2) Michael Bay has gained a reputation as a director who makes summer blockbusters loaded with explosions and huge special effects, but lacking in story and characters. If this is what you are looking for, than Transformers will probably not disappoint.The movie, which stars Shia LaBeouf, Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel, and the beautiful Megan Fox, depicts Optimus Prime and the Autobots battling Megatron and the Decepticons while the fate of the human race hangs in the balance. Overall, the story was what it was, neither too complicated nor too intriguing.The special effects on the transformers themselves were simply wonderful. They all looked as realistic as cars which turn into robots can possibly look, and they blended in nicely with the human actors and the settings. It was actually stunning to see them all transform.However, where the movie went wrong was Bay's direction. He absolutely ruined the film for me with his pacing, shot selection, and editing. While the machines looked great, every scene where they battled was cut up so much that I could hardly tell what was going on. One reason I enjoyed Live Free or Die Hard was because the filmmakers took a step back and allowed the audience to see the action scenes play out. This made the movie far more entertaining, and easier to follow. In Bay's film, action scenes seemed disjointed, and I felt like I never truly got a good look at what was happening.Furthermore, the movie had too many characters that were in separate places for much of the movie. While many action movies deal with a situation from one point of view, this movie dealt with it from four or five different points of view, making the movie feel even more disjointed. While each of these characters was well acted, I think the film would have been well served to tone it down to simply one point of view (that of Shia La Beouf and Megan Fox). This would have trimmed down the running time, and made for more of a succinct plot.Overall, I came into this film not expecting much, and I left disappointed. Where its cheesiness was at times entertaining, it quickly became boring. The action sequences also made me angry with their quick cuts and numerous close-ups. I think this had the potential to be a great movie, but because of Mr. Bay, it was a huge disappointment. I give the film 4.5/10 salty stix, and I would recommend if you are looking for an entertaining action movie to see this July 4th, skip this and see Live Free or Die Hard.Google Saltystix for more movie reviews","Jul 3, 2007",4,/10
"I just saw this movie this afternoon at the Power Plant Cinema. What I saw was the best 2 hour plus film this year since Alpha Dog. Despite some rather ludicrous lines between some human characters and absurd bloopers - some of which I will leave to your discretion - let me just say that Michael Bay deserves an Oscar. This is one of the best films of this year. The direction, visual effects, sound effects, etc are the best. First, there was Armageddon, then Pearl Harbor, and now this. Michael, don't stop. I know that a MB film has to be entertaining to some extent, but this was just incredible. Simple story line, awesome effects. This film is not only for children; or maybe it's not, I don't know. But grown ups will enjoy it. I've never seen a robot act almost human. And that Megan is a good find. More, please? Bravo, all!","Jul 1, 2007",10,/10
"My kids grew up watching Transformers on TV and took their kids to see it. I waited and saw it on video because I couldn't believe a movie such as this would be treated the way it was. I have about given up on movies because the good ones are few and far between. The so-called stars of today are for the most part self-centered and non-talented. My real complaint with Transformers is the dialogue concerning masturbation. Why in the world was that in there? Is Hollywood attempting to debase the rest of the country so that we will be as immoral as it is? Along the same lines, why do movies designed for kids have to contain at least one fart scene? (Shrek, etc.) What does it add? The visual effects of Transformers were expertly done, and it had the potential to be a really good movie, but the script put it in the gutter. Sorry, but it's not worth the trouble.","Nov 12, 2007",3,/10
"OH MY GOD!!!!!I wanted to stay in my seat and tell them to run the damn movie again! Effin fanstastic!I was a huge Transformers buff in the 80's and my morning cartoons wouldn't have been the same without Optimus Prime and the gang. With so many other die hard Transformers purists rabbiting on about ""boo hoo Bumblebee isn't a VW"" it's easy to get swept up in thinking it's not going to be good but this was easily the best cartoon adaption ever and probably one of the best movies of the year!CG-freaking fantastic. Dialogue-effin great. Acting talent- Shia is outstanding, awesome quick one liners from support cast, Josh Duhamell FREAKIN HAWT!!All in all an amazingly well done movie and worth the wait!","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"What a 'ROCK'!!!!!!!! Maybe I should have been watched this gorgeous movie since the first time premier. Because I think, one big reason that I didn't like this movie when I first time saw it... because it contains a war between a robot. Exactly, a car which can transform into a robot. And, the trouble with me is, I don't like any kinds of car and even robot. So, maybe if I watch this movie I'll feel so boring... But,it's different now. Actually, I underestimated this film first. Otherwise, along with this film plot-story, and the technology used in making up of this film, I suppose, I'd like to recognize all of the part of this film. It seems so perfect!!!!!!! The running time is a little bit long, and it's very suitable for the story plot line.Mostly, two hours and a half minutes. Wow, that's amazing!!! So,please.....don't underestimate this film. Because I think it has brought.....a big 'changing' of my life ever, and ever again in my movie history! Oh, one more.....Although I don't like robots or cars (like a toy,etc.), but I suggest you to watch this movie, because you'll never feel sorry later on!!!!!!!!!Last one is, extraordinary!!!!! Well, a good job done by the director, and even the actors and actresses. Perhaps, Michael Bay should make the sequel of this film.....I hope so. And I will wait for that moment!!!!!!!!","Jul 1, 2007",10,/10
"I considered this as one of my best movie. Is this consider Michael Bay's best? I think so. Although, you can see his usual big and loud action with exploding things. When we first heard that Michael Bay was going to direct this movie, we all knew that it would be loud and had a lot of action. Michael displayed his action types. Exploding things come smashing and big robots chunking themselves at each others. So when you are watching this in cinema, it will be very loud. Michael made the robots' designs cool with the modern touch. Those who complain that the robots do not look like the usual cartoon, Michael made the robots to look cool, they are modern, not to look like the old cartoons.The story is dead simple, you get a young man, Sam Witwicky falls in love with a pretty girl, Mikaela and bought a old car which transforms into Bumblebee. From there, the Decepticons chase them and Optimus Prime told them that they want the glasses which has the location of the allspark. The robots smashing each others start here.The fightings are intense, smashing and hurling at each other, it means you get to see brief moments on how the robots are fighting. The Decepticons are disappointing, most of them only come to screen at the last half and hour and do not show their true powers, I mean, they are huge and evil-looking for no reason. You will get to see Megatron fighting Optimus Prime, the longest fight. The final fight is the best but the whole movie is good with the heavy music.This is for all, fans or not. Those who are not fans of transformers may like this too as this is not about the robots, it is the action. Those fans of action, you also will want to watch this. Worth the price of the tickets.","Jun 30, 2007",10,/10
"where to begin?this was without doubt the grainiest film i've seen in a cinema. seriously, i've watched pirated films that had better picture quality.the robots were cool as (expletive deleted) but the cgi was overdone....and the script, well...that was nothing short of appalling.michael bay has demonstrated once more that he cannot be trusted to make films.the only plus point i can think of is the ""dogging"" reference bay managed to slip past the censors.","Jul 22, 2007",4,/10
"This movie is brilliant - and I'm already looking forward to Transformers 2 in 2009It took my breath away every second in this film. Its is more than great.. I do not think I have seen a better movie since ""The Lord Of The Rings - The return of the king"" This movie will take Oscars.. And i like to say which i mean it possible may take:Best Picture Best Sound Best Visuel Effects Best Director Best Sound Editing Best Supporting actor - Jon VoigtA really great movie - I can't find the words .. 10/10 ( 100/10 ;) )","Jul 16, 2007",10,/10
"I am surely in the minority but I can't help it. This was a disappointment for me. But I am not surprised...thanks for nothing to Bay. The idea of the Transformers was good enough. The first part of the movie was good enough. I actually started to like the movie because the introduction to the characters was very well done and the Transformers looked believable. But during the action back in the US of A, it lost its way. The interaction between the characters was so unbelievable. Sure the story is a fantasy, but when you have such a fantasy as this one could have been, making the characters act like idiots doesn't help the movie. Of course Bay had to exaggerate everything. I am not sure why he has to push everything over the edge, and I do mean everything! Go if you loved the Transformers as a child, you can still feel like a kid at this movie. Just don't expect lasting quality beyond the appearances of the bots.","Jul 8, 2007",5,/10

"Transformers will always be ""More Then Meets the Eye!"" with me. I've been a huge fan since 1984 when I was 8 years old and first saw a bunch of cartoon robots turn into vehicles to hide themselves (robots in disguise). After a long time of following the different story lines, comic books, and series incantations the this concept has brought to life over the years. I have to say that the creators of this new film did a very good job of providing yet another chapter in the Autobot/Decepticon battle. Not only a new chapter but maybe even an all new book. Kudo's. Go see it, if you're a fan from the original series that started back in 84' or someone who's never even heard of Transformers. This movie holds something for just about anyone who loves action, effects, and a good fast paced story about good versus evil. It even has Peter Cullin, the original voice of Optimus Prime staring as such. Awesome.","Jul 7, 2007",8,/10
"The only good thing about this film is the computer generated transformers. This film could have been very good, however there are some top actors in this who are given some of the worst dialogue ever and a story line that has more holes than a sieve.I was extremely disappointed in the film (especially one from DreamWorks that has Steven Spielberg's name on it) and had to laugh throughout the film at the lame lines the actors said with straight faces. There were at least two dozen places where I had to scratch my head and make believe I was a ten year old to keep up with the story which made no logical or common sense.If I had to guess at the age of the writers and director, I would say they couldn't be more than 13. Which is due to the level of writing for the dialogue and the lame scenario presented by the 'lead' teenager. His angst and horniness is on par with other summer films which try to only capture and appeal to pubescent boys and their elders who have never gone past the age of 14 socially, emotionally, or mentally.The only redeeming value to my film experience is that I didn't pay to see this or I would have walked out and demanded a refund. Not even worthy of a rental for laughs.","Jul 20, 2007",1,/10
"Let me start by saying that, those of who were born in the 1970s like me and who grew up in the 80s and 90s watching those great cartoons that they used to show back then (unlike now where most of the cartoons are a load of crap), Transformers was one of the best cartoon show of the 80s and not to mention one of the best cartoon show of all time.I always wondered whether they would be able to make an actual Transformers movie with amazing CGI, good action, some humour and last but not least a good plot. Well they finally have. I saw this movie about an hour ago at the cinema and I have to say I am blown away. By far Transformers would have to be the best movie released for 2007. All those elements mentioned above that are required in a movie are in this film.I think I speak for most movie buffs out there that this movie has more action and intrigue within the first 20 minutes than Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, Matrix: Reloaded and Spider-Man 2 combined. Even after the first 20 minutes and beyond Transformers delivered what movie watchers were after. There was action, there was explosions, there was laughter and victory. Other good points about this movie is that it displays no matter what obstacles that humans may face, it is the spirit within us that helps us to victory.Shai LaBeouf performed well as Sam Witwickey and Megan Fox delivered a good performance as Mikaela Banes. For all the guys (and I mean guys and not girls) she is another good reason to see this film. She is beautiful. Actually beautiful is an understatement, she is breath taking.The bad points that I can think of are that I wished there was more fight scenes between Optimus Prime and Megatron, Megatron's facial appearance did not look at all much like the 80s cartoon and there should have been more Transformers characters introduced. But apart from that a great film for all ages.","Jul 8, 2007",8,/10
"After watching this, and both Pearl Harbor and The Island, also directed by Michael Bay, I can hardly contain my outrage that he was still allowed to excrete this one-hundred and fifty million dollar gang-raping of American cinema. The funds used for this movie's production could have been better spend feeding thousands of starving African children, yet Mr. Bay defiantly opted instead for this metallic, loud, over-confident, pompous, self-congratulatory theatrical wet dream. If there was an award for overuse of clichéd lines, this movie would take top honors. It would sweep the Razzies hands down, beating out anything starring Segal or Van Damme.","Jul 24, 2007",1,/10
"I go to the movies to be entertained. And this movie entertained me... a lot.Don't listen to all these people who are railing on the movie and decrying Michael Bay. The bottom line is that it is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. If you're just a regular person, who knows that you don't go to see a movie about machines from outer space that turn into giant killing robots for the enchanting dialogue and brilliant complex plot then you will enjoy the movie a lot. Unlike a time-period, sensitive piece like ""Pearl Harbor,"" which Bay mutilated, this is right in Bay's wheelhouse.And if you are upset that this movie was not true to the original cartoon series, you have to get over it - that was like twenty years ago, and if it troubles you that much, then you're probably a pretty big loser. Sorry to break it to you. There are new cartoons out now that you could probably get into that won't be adapted to cinema for a while.The bottom line is that this movie has everything I'm looking for out of a Hollywood summer movie - great action, hot chicks, and a surprising amount of humor. I was pleasantly surprised by Shia Lebouf, who going into it was my number one concern about the flick. Anyway, if you like movies for the escapism and aren't a Transformers nerd, you need to see it right now.","Jul 28, 2007",10,/10
"Let me start this off by saying that I'm one of these people who thinks of himself as a film critic. If I dislike something, I'm honest about it. If I feel something is contrived, cliché, or well-worn territory, I'm vocal about it. Transformers is a movie that blatantly violates many of my 'good- movie-criterion', and yet I've seen it twice already in the 4 days since it's premiered. And I plan to see it again. It's fantastic. Whether you grew up on the cartoons like myself, or if you don't know an autobot from a decepticon, Transformers is the ultimate crowd-pleasing July 4th blockbuster. I can't find many people who don't start smiling as they watch massive transforming robots fire missiles at each other in slow motion on a two-story movie screen. I think I saw everyone in the theater half- stand up out of their seats when Barricade chased down Bumblebee while ""Pretty Handsome Awkward"" by The Used assaulted our senses. And, twice now, have I seen a standing ovation given to a movie as the credits roll. Normally, like many of you, I'm in the mood for a film that makes me think, makes me question, and features profound writing and acting. If you want to take a break from that for one night, however, and enjoy some massive action that will leave you dumbfounded, strap yourself into the theater seat, and watch the best guilty pleasure flick of the past three or so decades","Jul 7, 2007",10,/10

"The film starts without a real story and brutal action, continues without a story and other brutal action and was simply too boring to stand it. Computer-generated imaging - bah, known and sick of since Lawnmower Man & Jurassic Park! Not recommended at all - especially NOT for children (the German recommendation ""12 and up"" is ridiculous). We saw many reasonably minded guests leaving the theater long before end and were attempted to do the same, but... Stay away from that film - even my son was awfully disappointed. But what do we expect if awful toys are made into a film - a good one...?Another movie the world would be better off without.","Sep 1, 2007",1,/10
"Alright, so Seoul got a early premiere, big deal -- no big deal compared to how the movie's going to blow your mind into an entire new level of expectation for upcoming Bay films.The CG is most def. a 10 out of 10. I guess the CG alone is already worth the price of a ticket. Absolutely Seamless. Def. more than you'd expect from the trailer.The action never stops. Compared to the Island, which took a long time to lay out the setting and background, leaving you with the nagging question ""When's the action going to start?,"" Transformers is quick in getting the ball rolling. I mean, the very first transformation you will see in awe, and you'll leave the cinema grinning ""How on earth did they pack in all that action?"" And as for humor, plot lines, or even casting, the rest you can judge for yourself since everyone has different expectations.","Jun 28, 2007",9,/10
"I have to say that I was totally disappointed when I watched this film. It by no way fulfilled the promise I took from the trailers and info I saw before. While the substance of the plot has every potential for a riveting science fiction film, the characters are completely ridiculous, not the parents, the federal agents, or anybody else show the seriousness you'd expect of a ""normal"" couple or police officer. In this machine-gun-like sequence of gags and special effects, the captivating potential is completely lost. So if you want a good, exciting science fiction with characters you can understand and relate to, beware of this film. If you want to see a suspense-less kaleidoscope of special effects and sound and jokes go for it.","Aug 8, 2007",3,/10
"I had very high expectations for this movie. I am a huge fan of sci-fi movies, and grew up watching Shia LaBeouf on TV. Obviously, I didn't want to be let down.Thankfully, I wasn't. This movie completely met all of my expectations and then some. The visual effects were amazing. Shia LaBeouf gave an exceptionally good performance. It was perfectly paced. I liked how there was actually a plot (unlike some people who didn't bother to pay attention to the dialog think) about two political parties who couldn't settle an argument over something, turned to war, brought an apocalypse to their world, and brought the war to ours. Very dramatic, perfectly paced, and the plot was appealing and interesting to me.People have been really picking on the character development in this movie. Personally, they just didn't feel it. Sam is a nerd with very few friends and desperately wants to be popular. Mikaela is very popular and is constantly abused and doesn't want to be and is looking for someone to give her salvation.A lot can be said about how bad the other two were: they both had lots of flaws. This movie, however, is absolutely flawless. I wouldn't change a single thing about it.","Mar 21, 2011",10,/10
"Yeah, it was all that and more. Sure there was a dubiously thin plot. Sure the entire premise was questionable at best. Sure the dialog ran into some pretty hokey territory on several occasions. And sure, the entire movie revolves completely on special effects and CGI. But all of this adds to the sheer awesomeness of the experience. You know it, the rest of the audience knows it, the actors know it and Michael Bay sure as hell knows it. Because he used every trick in the book to make a movie that people will be in awe of for a very long time into the future. Not for its artistic value or for its contribution to society, but for the sheer pleasure you can take in its vapidness. Its fun to the extreme, and doesn't even try to make any apologies for what its not. Not many movies can say that.Sure, people will point out continuity errors, or explain that the love story was somewhat forced, or that most of the cast achieved Shatner-levels of overacting. But these people are fools and snobs who need to loosen up and get a sense of humor.So yes, go see Transformers; the first episode in what is sure to be a long line of sequels. Worth every penny.","Jul 7, 2007",9,/10

"Reading other reviews, I laugh at the arguments people put forward in favor of this film - most point out who the director is, and others enjoy the sexy Megan Fox.To me, this movie is nothing but a sheet metal mess. Cars that measure 2-3 meters are transformed into robots 10 meters high and 4 meters wide. And when they start to fight - it's a big rolling pile of iron, in which I find no charm.I love fantasy movies, but this one is a bit more fantasy for me. It is too childish and naive.The boy in the main role has a high-pitched squeaky voice, and at the beginning of the movie he was especially annoying.The girl gives an erotic flavor to the whole story, but even this does not change the fact that the script is naive and hollow. The dialogue is rudimentary and the acting is generally pretty weak.All these shortcomings are compensated by ""stunning"" special effects, which turns the film into a naive children's story about cars, trucks and robots.It's hard for me to rate it higher than 4/10 because I barely got through it.","Feb 17, 2023",3,/10
"This was a hell of a lot better than I thought it would be. The first trailer for it came out last July, a year before the movie premiered. You really had no idea what it would be about. I am only 14, so I did not grow up in the 80s. At the time I did not want to see it. A couple of months later, in November I saw a trailer for it. That showed me that it was action packed and looked like it was very intense. In May, I went to see Pirates 3.(Which was great by the way) Anyway, the trailer explained the whole ordeal. Lots of action, great special effects, and of course, Shia Laboef. He makes the world go round. After I saw that trailer, I knew immediately that I wanted to see this movie the day it came out. I saw it one July third. I was caught completely by surprise. I did not expect it to be as good as it was. I was Transformed.I was in awe at the end of the movie. It was so surprisingly good. I thought would just give it a seven, an eight at the most. But this clearly would get higher than that. Let me just say all the good things right now. The action was practically non-stop. It was one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time. There was action from beginning to end. The special effects were the best ever. Literally. The transformations were the most realistic high quality visuals ever shot. The next great thing was Shia Labeof. He made this movie. He is a great actor. There was also great acting by Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel. It also had a great supporting cast of Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson, and others. I loved this movie. Another thing that caught me by surprise was the comedy. It was incredibly funny throughout. That was very surprising. Almost everything about it was good even the story and script. Now, for the bads.There were very few bads, but they were some major details. The main actress just can't act. Also, the dialog for her was pretty bad. But I think that's about it. Michael did a great job directing this movie. This has been his best movie ever. I used to think that my favorite movie by him was The Rock. It's not anymore. Now, it's Transformers.This was a great movie. I think that it is the best Sci-Fi movie ever. I think that it's better than Star War, The Matrix, and Terminator 2 combined. This is a lot like Independence day. Its a saga of people all over the US and they have to unite to beat the things from outer space. The movie was actually even dramatic in parts. Its kind of like the rock. How its really funny, but also turns out to be really dramatic towards the end. I loved this movie. I think that it is the best sci-fi movie of all time, one of the best action movies of all time, and quite possibly, one of the greatest movies of all time. Maybe not but I think it is because I loved it so much. I loved this movie and that's all I can say. I have been transformed because it caught me completely by surprise. I have been Transformed. 10/10.","Jul 8, 2007",10,/10
"Im no movie reviewer, but this movie was a massive disappointment.The story is junk, the acting pathetic and the casting.....well i don't think anyone thought about it! If you are going to make a m rated movie, at least make it a bit harder.This was the kind of laughs and romance a 10 year old might enjoy.The animation was fantastic, though why they mask the stunning animation with scattered camera work is frustrating to watch.Get the guy who did batman returns to sort this mess out.Wait for the DVD version so you can skip the junk.(about 110 minutes)The good guys are bumbling fools, who enjoy the odd games of hide and seek, and a poorly written joke.This director would be better of working on the next Britney spears movie.","Jul 15, 2007",3,/10
"Nothing I've ever seen in compares to the sight of Optimus Prime turning from a truck to a robot and blasting the hell out of the Decepticons to the tune of YOU GOT THE TOUCH by Stan bush. I remember seeing the 1986 movie with my friend, Richard. We were the oldest kids in the theater and what a great crowd to see the film with. Everyone cheered and shouted all through it.So, I'm a Transformer fan.I'm not a Micheal Bay fan.After PEARL HARBOR, I swore to never darken my eyeballs with another Micheal Bay film. It was easy with BAD BOYS 2 and THE ISLAND, but that jerk just had to make a Transformers movie. You can imagine how nervous I was about the film. For every good bit of news, (Peter Cullen plays Optimus Prime!) there was bad news.I saw a Monday night preview with Lindsay and not only was it great, but it wiped away every shitty thing that has ever happened to me. SHIA LA BEOUF plays Sam Witwicky. Sam was called Spike on the cartoon and I never thought too much of his character. He seemed to just there to bounce lines off the robots. Here, he's a fully realized character thanks to the filmmakers and Beouf. He's very likable, funny, and has a place in this world. Sam unknowingly has the key to save Earth from an invasion from the Decepticons.What I was afraid of was that this film would turn out like the American Godzilla movie. Where boring people would take up most of the movie saying boring unfunny things and we'd only get a little of the robots. That didn't happen. In the first ten minutes we get an attack from Blackout on a army base. bay wastes no time getting to the mystery of what has landed here and what do they want.The scenes with Sam, Mikaela Banes(Meagan Fox), and Bumblebee are almost exciting enough to be a film all by itself....but then, Optimus Prime and company arrive. Just like in 86, the crowd I saw this with went nuts at every turn. They cheered when Optimus shows up, when Bumblebee first transformers to fight Barricade, and all throughout the film. The Autobots themselves were in character and quite funny when they had to sneak around. Peter Cullen is the only actor I wanted to play Optimus Prime, I'm so happy that they didn't get some A-list star. His voice makes James Earl Jones sound like Eddie Deezen. WHAT WAS COOL:HELL! ALMOST EVERYTHING! Hearing the Transformer sound when Blackout attacks. The Prime/Bonecrusher fight. Frenzy sneaking around Air Force One. Bumblebee taking a robot wiz on Agent Simmons(JOHN TURTURRO).The fact that there weren't any big stars. Keven Dunn and Julie White as Ron and Judy Witwicky! They were smart enough to know that the robots were the stars.NOT SO COOL:No Soundwave. Not enough character stuff with the decepticons. Megatron and Starscream have only one exchange.Anyway, go enjoy this summer action movie, and to all you fanboys out there, leave your attitudes at the door.ROLL OUT!!","Jul 7, 2007",10,/10
"This was a non-stop action film from the very beginning. The explosions, car crashes, bombs, and loud noises come at a break-neck pace. Fans of Bay's style will not be disappointed. The action was punctuated with just enough comedy to keep things from getting too repetitive. Sure, there were parts that were a little corny, but I felt they were staying true to the original Transformers style. They were do-gooders who constantly uttered corny ""save-the-world hero type"" lines. This is kind of a love/hate film. Some kids behind me didn't like it and I get the feeling it was due to some of the corny lines. People unfamiliar with the original cartoon series may not get it, but for those of us over 35, it was a visit back in time. I really enjoyed this film.","Jul 4, 2007",8,/10
"Explosions, computer effects, guns, global annihilation. If a film has any or all of these parts it is most likely costly and will reel in a hefty load at the box office. But outside of the cinema gross and DVD sales, the film is most likely lost in the mix of the action-adventure genre. Sometimes, a film breaks out of the jumble and gets noticed.Michael Bay is known for big explosions, CGI effects throughout, big and nasty looking weaponry, and of course, the threat placed on our planet of total and complete destruction. After six films using and abusing all of these elements, it was time for a change. He found his answer in the unlikeliest of all places: A toy.Transformers have been a kid favorite. The ability to make a car or a helicopter ""transform"" into a alien robot has dazzled the minds of youngsters for years. Now this concept, this world of alien robotics has made its way to the big screen in a big way in Bay Transformers.The battlefield is Earth and the humans are caught in the middle of an intergalactic war between the Autobots (good guys) and the Decepticons (bad guys). Each side is after the All Spark, a cube that contains the power to transform a machine into a fierce warrior robot. Megatron, leader of the Decepticons, wants to use this power to take over Earth and create the army that he needs. Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots, wants to destroy the All Spark before it gets into the hands of Megatron.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is the new owner of an old Camaro which just so happens to be Bumblebee, one of the Autobots. His plan was to impress Mikaela (Megan Fox) but ends of bringing her into this ordeal. Sam and Mikaela are dragged into the thick of things because Sam holds the key to finding the All Spark in his relative's belongings. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and the rest of the Autobots, vow to protect Sam and to find the All-Spark before it gets into the hands of the Megatron and his gang of Decepticons.The film right from the get-go starts off with a ""BANG!"" and doesn't let go until the final frame. The action in this film is comparable to few films that I have seen. Transformers interact with the real environment and wreak havoc everywhere. Cars are tossed aside like used tissues and the ground is as soft as butter where this metal goliaths roam. Destruction is unavoidable with these guys around. Bay's blend of real-time explosions and effects mixed with the power and awe of the transformers is stunning to say the least.One thing that films of this caliber usually lack is weak acting due to a weaker script or just plain old bad acting. The cast seems to fit nicely in their roles and the dialogue isn't too unpleasant. Action films are full of clichés to begin with but Transformers has a nice balance of action, story, and comedy.From start to finish, Transformers just won't ease up. It is a joy ride that will leave you dumbfounded and simply amazed at what Bay and his team have created. This is more than an action film. Be careful, these toys could be hazardous...","Jul 4, 2007",8,/10

"This movie is definitely worthy of being in the top 250 list of greatest movies. The movie starts off with a bang, and I was hooked the entire time. The CGI in the movie is the best I have ever seen. Growing up watching Transformers as a kid, and to see it evolve into a brilliant movie like this.Along with the awesome CGI, the movie is actually really funny which adds to the entertainment.In my opinion, this move beats out all other blockbusters that have come out this year, if you have not yet seen this movie I highly recommend you do. I can't wait for the sequel!!!!!!!!!!!","Jul 6, 2007",10,/10
"The generation that grew up with the first Transformers movie comes back with an awful version. The watergate babies truly are the least creative generation. Maybe the high school comedy was too long. Maybe the robots were too detailed to watch. There are no heroine transformers, unlike the 1986 movie.The shaky camera, home video look is hard to follow, but it's all in a day's work for a generation which grew up with hand held home videos. The human heroine is pretty independent, never depending on the men 2 save her, although she depends on the autobots.The dialog in the 1986 movie was preposterous and out there, but it made it interesting. The new dialog just fits in and is boring. Except for Optimus Prime, the voices were disappointing. The original Megatron, Starscream, and Bumblebee voices are gone. The new voices are indistinguishable, just fitting in again.At least John Voight got 2 B the good guy for a change.","Oct 20, 2007",1,/10
"I've been a fan of Transformers for as long as they've been around. I've seen them transform into everything from cars to planes to animals. In Beast Machines, one of the Maximals could transform into a plant! They've been everything under the sun and more besides, so it might have been a little difficult for the filmmakers to find a fresh direction for the robots. I prefer to think that this film was created for a new generation of robophiles who've never heard of Transformers, and the die-hard fans who wanted to see them go in a new direction. I, as one of the die-hard fans, love this movie and can't wait for the sequels to start pouring out.I really liked Bumblebee's new vehicle mode. Going from a Volkswagen Beetle to a Camaro is a real step up the ladder for the little guy. And Megatron's new look is appropriately menacing. I can understand why some of the purists might have a problem about this movie, but I think they need to calm down a little. The Transformers mythology, like everything else, has to evolve or it'll go extinct. Think of this movie as an alternate universe that expands the possibilities for future storytelling, just like the comics did in the 80s. Sure, the characters might not be as we remember them, but I believe the changes are for the better and will only enhance the enjoyment for anyone with a flexible enough mind.","Jul 16, 2007",10,/10
"I made sure to get tickets to the first showing in my area. I went into the theatre expecting it to be pretty cool, but I came out disbelieving. It not only matched my expectations, it exceeded them by leaps and bounds. A chill ran down my spine when the credits rolled. I'm sitting here 2 hours after the movie ended and my hands are still shaking. The CGI was incredible, the acting was amazing. Shia gave an excellent performance. The jokes were hilarious, the action was captivating, and the cinematography was top-notch. I myself plan to become a film director, and I have to say, if I could direct a movie HALF as good as Micheal Bay did with Transformers, I would be happy. If you have not seen this movie yet, I recommend you see it as soon as possible. There are no words good enough to express my amazement. Wow.","Jul 2, 2007",10,/10

"I only joined IMDb to say that this is easily the second worst film I have ever had the misfortune of enduring.Like all michael bay ""films"" (and I use the term loosely, as it more strongly resembles a very long commercial for ebay and various car manufacturers), the script is, at best... godawful.I can only conclude michael bay categorically hates humanity - particularly moviegoers - and that this is his primary motive for making these torturous abominations: to inflict as much suffering as possible upon his victims.We have to stop this foul creature from spawning any more of these diabolical creations - each of them is not only an embarrassment to humankind, but a waste of natural resources, and an unforgivable crime against humanity! Please write to your local authorities and insist upon his immediate arrest.What movie could possibly be worse than this, I hear you ask? michael ""the misanthrope"" bay's ""pearl harbour"" - but only because it was longer.","Dec 8, 2007",1,/10
"Transformers is surprisingly a really, really good movie. Sure, its camp and cheese and the plot doesn't make sense for even one second, but as far as movies like this go, Transformers is made with a certain precision and style missing in either of the Fantastic Four movies. Also, surprisingly, Transformers is quite funny too. I've laughed as harder and as often at the jokes and gags in Transformers as I did in most of the comedies I've seen this year. Again, they're certainly better than the gags in Fantastic Four.Of course, the visual effects and sound design are the real stars of this movie, and boy do they deliver! The Transformers look like they are really in the environments they appear to be in. The sound design will probably go unmentioned in a lot of reviews and stuff, but they deserve a nod too because they managed to find create a new and interesting aural feel for giant robots built on past archetypes, but still completely original. There's one Transformer that transforms from a briefcase into a biped about 5 feet tall that has this voice, look, and way of moving like a little animal that I found fascinating, funny, and cool at the same time.So in short, if you buy a ticket to this movie, you will be seeing probably the best Michael Bay film there ever was and perhaps ever will be. If you're looking for more than that, then this isn't the movie for you.","Jul 3, 2007",9,/10
"How massively irresponsible was it for them to go to the city with these evil destroyer robots on their tail? I actually liked a few parts of this movie; the quirky bits with Bumblebee were cute. The romance was slightly amusing. I liked the sci-fi feel with the dam and the All-spark, or whatever it was. But as soon as they said, ""Let's go to the city,"" I just groaned, because it was just so ludicrous. If you have a bunch of giant robots on your side and a bunch more who are fighting them, you don't go in the city! You go out in the middle of nowhere to have it out where civilians won't get hurt. It was such a painfully obvious excuse to have a cool battle in the middle of tall buildings with lots of special effects and explosions, which is fun to watch but it definitely gets old after a while. By the third car smashing I just wanted to leave the theater because it was all such needless, reckless violence, that instead of thrilling, I just found it annoying. I guess they had to put in so many explosions to distract people from the massive plot hole.","Mar 22, 2008",2,/10

"Yes, I said it, Michael Bay's Transformers, more than exceeds and meets the public's eye.Fans of the old cartoon, as well as fans of the Beast Wars cartoon are going to be very pleased with Michael Bay's updated transformation of one of the most beloved cartoons in history.Transformers, for most who are not familiar concerns a group of robots from the planet Cybertron. The good guys are called Autobots, and the bad guys are called Decepticons.I had not seen the first cartoon series since I was too young to enjoy them but I had seen Beast Wars a decade ago, and I have to say, that this movie made me a believer in the original transformers more than I could ever hope for.This movie was absolutely fantastic, and the crowd I saw the movie with cheered and applauded again.Thank you, Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg, this movie was terrific!Give me G1 Transformers over Beast Wars anyday!","Jul 10, 2007",10,/10
"A live-action movie about the Transformers. What more could a fan wish? A live-action movie about the real Transformers, for one.Having owned the toys (and having loved them) and having watched the series in its entirety more than twice (and having loved that, too, in the deepest sense of the word) I was almost moved to tears when I first heard about this movie. Seeing some of the heroes of my youth really move and fight, thanks to the visual effects of today, was literally a dream come true.Save for the fact that it's NOT them.I seriously wonder if anyone within the production, screen writing, and SFX personnel actually remembers -or took the time to watch- the original series. The complex battle for domination (Energon cubes, anyone?) that was portrayed in the series is totally absent here. Unlike the Transformers of old, none of these ones has any tangible personality; the Decepticons are bent on destroying humankind and the Autobots are bent on stopping them. Now, this may or may not be a consequence of not having enough time/space to tell the whole story, but it's hardly a good thing to start with.And apart from personality, what exactly happened to the robots' aesthetics? If technology is available to render a giant robot on screen and animate its morphing into a car or truck, then how hard can it be to have it morph in the PROPER car or truck?! Instead, Starscream is an F-22 Raptor, Bumblebee is a Chevrolet Camaro, Optimus Prime is... well, not a cab-over truck. And I won't even mention Megatron. The only thing left coherent with the original design seems to be the paint scheme.As a die-hard Transformers fan, I tried and tried again, but I just could not see Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and ultimately Megatron in the characters bearing the respective names within this movie. It will probably be a huge hit because of the exceptional and unprecedented (at least to my memory) visual effects. It will rock and shock the audience with its frenetic combat scenes, big loud explosions, and bullet time sequences. It will be the ultimate robot movie -- at least, until the already announced sequel comes out.However, if we are to assume that 'transfoming robots' equals 'The Transformers', then we can also take any ordinary kid, have him lose his family in a tragic accident, dress him as a baseball player, paint the whole in shades of black, and finally pretend it's Batman.","Jun 21, 2007",1,/10
"After all the hype n hoopla,its finally here and believe me this movie fails to disappoint.After all the big movies released so far,namely spidey3 n poc3,this too could've gone their way n not hit the mark.But what u get in ""transformers"" is just pure entertainment,what we call in India-""a masala flick"".Kudos to Maichael Bay and the rest of the team for somehow weaving the plot in such a way so as to incorporate humans into this story of the robots.The acting as such isn't great and i came out thinking that the robots gave a much better performance than any of the humans.Turturro's humor comes out extremely dry.Megan Fox satisfies us with her beauty and nothing more.Shia is OK.But this movie's gonna be remembered only for its action and S.F.X.Anyways this movie's just a feast for the eyes(and so is Megan fox).Just make sure you carry enough pop corn into the hall at the start cos there's no way your going to feel like getting out of your seat once your locked and loaded.Get ready for one wild ride where spider-man meets the NFL meets terminator meets every other action flick ever made.This is truly one of Hollywood's greatest entertainers.","Jul 4, 2007",8,/10

"They keep making ""Transformers"" movies. The most recently effort was 2023's ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"". I assume this is in vain attempt to come close to capturing the same lightning in the bottle that made the original ""Transformers"" movie so excellent.They might as well stop.It won't happen.I personally think ""Transformers"" should be remembered as one of the great action/sci-fi movies of the 00's. The franchise has gone downhill in a hurry, but this one was brilliant. Perhaps director Michael Bay's worst impulses and excesses were reined in at least a touch by executive producer Steven Spielberg more so than in sequels to come?The cast is great. Megan Fox and Shia LeBeouf probably made enormous fortunes from this movie alone. It's easy to make fun of them, but they were fine.The supporting cast, including Josh Duhamel, Jon Voight, Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson and Glenn Morshower, were also good.A script with some good light-hearted and comedic moments, spectacular action sequences (especially if you like alien robots smashing into each other and various locations on earth as well), the patented Michael Bay slow motion scenes. Visually, one of the most epic movies I've ever seen. Say what you will about Bay as a director, but the man knows how to make a visually pleasing popcorn movie. Of that, there should be no complaints.Really, really fun Hollywood blockbuster entertainment, a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, even during it's most serious moments.It's a shame the sequels weren't up to the high standard of the original.","Aug 31, 2024",9,/10

"I didn't intend to see this movie at first, but after some stellar reviews from friends who I usually agree with in movie selections, I decided to give it a chance. First I will say what I did like about the film.The visual effects were superb. The shots with the transformers transforming were amazingly realistic. My wife told me that there were a few times that she was watching them and thought ""come on, don't take so long..."" and then realized that what she was watching was not really happening. Very cool.There were some of the funniest one-liners I've seen in an action movie. Even though I wasn't especially enjoying the film, there were several times that I laughed out loud at a line or sight gag.Now for what I didn't like about the film. First of all, I'm over the whole ""amazing visual effects"" effect. Have been since the last LOTR. I don't go see CGI movies because I don't care how amazing the animation is if there isn't a good story. So I see them when I hear there's a good story. To me, Transformers had the effects, and that's it. And I got bored with it.Further, there were too many characters, and none were developed at all. Not to mention that Bernie Mac's cameo was extremely unnecessary and distracting. It appeared that the filmmakers were trying to tug on your heart about certain characters, but you didn't know who they were or care about them. The only character I cared about was Bumblebee, and that was because you just thought he was sweet. Everyone else seemed like people you were looking at while you walk through Wal-Mart's toy section.I paid one dollar to see this through RedBox. I'm glad I didn't spend any more.","Nov 15, 2007",4,/10

The movie is a bit pacey with a not so extraordinary storyline and a decent performance from its co stars , but it is the special effects which takes this movie to the next level . The special effects being shown in this movie beats the recent releases like spiderman-3 potc-3 harry potter-5 etc by a mile the robots being shown in this movie look quite real. The movie is very well directed . The scenes between the robots and human is really well done . The background score for this movie is quite good. It is a very good comic book to film conversion . I advice all those who are real comic book fans should go for this movie . You wont be disappointed .

A very cheesy film and a very bad film. Michael Bay messed up again i thought Michael Bay could redeem himself for Pearl Harbor but this was just as bad. This is the type of film which may appeal little kids aged 5-10. But for guys my age we want our story lines smart and interesting not cheesy and awful.I could have made the story better when i was 9. The film also has loads of characters each having a cheesy story because at the end the good guys who were the losers eider win the girl of their dreams or become a hero. But to look on the bright side. The acting by Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox were reasonable. But most of the rest of the acting was awful. But hate it or love it has great special effects.

"Imagine several robots are invading our planet and igniting a worldwide war simply to find your great-grandfather's old glasses, which hold valuable data, and you're selling the product on eBay for less than its worth. It was Sam's fate to purchase Bumblebee from the car lot. He discovered the history behind the robots' arrival and the purpose of their mission. Good and evil are constantly at battle in all forms. In a race against time, Optimus Prime and the Autobots sought to locate the Allspark before it fell into the wrong hands, but the government's interception delayed the process.

I'm not saying the genre should make for an exclusively boys' film....but C' MOOO-OOON!- I've heard gutsier dialogue in trailers for 'One Tree Hill'. The effects that I could make out were fairly convincing...Most of the time, however, you need the reflexes of a May Fly to actually see whats going on. Which, I'm sorry, in Mac Monkey land spells out one thing....LAZY. This truly is an unwatchable crock.

"Transformers, directed by Michael Bay, is an exceptional movie that has gained a massive following since its release in 2007. It has everything you could want in a summer blockbuster: breathtaking action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie.For many fans, including myself, Transformers has become a favorite movie of all time since its release. I have watched it over 100 times and never tire of it. The movie's ability to blend humor and action seamlessly, the chemistry between the characters, and the incredible computer-generated imagery used to bring the robots to life are just a few reasons why it has gained such a massive following.The movie follows the story of the Autobots, a group of alien robots who come to Earth in search of a powerful energy source called the AllSpark. Along the way, they team up with a teenager named Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf) and the brave soldier, Captain Lennox (played by Josh Duhamel), to prevent the Decepticons, a rival group of robots, from obtaining the AllSpark and destroying humanity.The level of detail put into the robots' design is impressive, and the way they transform from vehicles to robots is seamless and realistic. The visual effects used in the movie are nothing short of incredible, making the action sequences even more thrilling.In conclusion, Transformers is a must-see movie that has earned its place as a classic in the science-fiction and action movie genre. Its compelling storyline, engaging characters, and fantastic visual effects make it an unforgettable cinematic experience that has gained a massive fan following worldwide.","Feb 18, 2023",10,/10
"I have been reading through the reviews and found some of then to be quite harsh. All dissing Michael Bay and i don't see the reason. This movie is done very well. Michael Bay has directed his actors very well. The acting is wonderful as well. Now on the the CG, that, is something to talk about. The CG is AMAZING. And the fact that its so hard to tell that the robots are not real, is a reason to praise the actors. There isn't a scene in this movie where i don't wonder if they are actually scared or not. A lot of people also judge this movie on authenticity to the animated TV show. I haven't watched the TV show but i know that you cannot make a movie about a ANIMATED TV show and use real people and make it as good as the ANIMATED KIDS TV show. This movie is not supposed to follow the little kids animated TV show so don't get your hopes up on that. It is an adult version. Hence all the explosions. Not supposed to be realistic. At. All.

When we went to see it, at first it was cool and all, until the auto bots came, then form then to the end, it was boring, because the director trying to make a fun part, but make the other way. I felt disappointed, and what I hated the most was that the transformers talked bad lines, they talk bullshits, like faith, and the people, and crap! The only thing I really like were the special effects, that was awesome, but the rest was like, corny, and non-sense. It should be a lot better, if not for the script.

"Okay, when I was young I never was a big Transformers fan. Until one day at the pool my dad says he wants to see the movie because he was a huge fan to the original cartoon when he was younger and he wanted to take me, my younger brother, and older sister to see it. But I wasn't so sure until he bought the entire Generation 1 series on DVD and we all watched every episode and I was literally like, I had no idea what I've been missing!"". Until finally the day came, the four of us drove to the theater, and when we got there, the lobby was packed with THOUSANDS of Transformers fans, from old to recent. And they were the ones who grew up with the original cartoon with their kids who got into the G1 series, including newer ones that were teenagers. Until finally after many minutes, we went into the room, the projector rolled, and we all watched it. And after two hours when it was over, the four of us and some people liked, some of them thought it was okay, and some are no longer Transformers fans. And I didn't care if the robots didn't resemble to the cartoon very well, it's just a solid Michael Bay-popcorn flick, and the sequels that proceeded this film (Except for Bumblebee), they will never top like this one.

"Transformers! Ah, the nostalgic robot fantasy of our childhood where vehicles morph into fighting robots. The endless battles between the Autobots and the Decepticons. The classic duels between Optimus Prime and Megatron. Now, the series is revived as a movie under the director-ship of Michael Bay.And what a movie! A true summer blockbuster in every sense of the word. The best summer movie by a mile this year. I was left often on the edge of my seat. I caught it at The Grand Cathay in The Cathay Cineplex, in digital format. The picture quality was superb. All the robots and fights scenes were rendered beautifully.The action is gripping and intense. The transformations from vehicles to robots and back again are seamless and classy. The fight scenes pack power and panache. The plot is acceptable, though there are a few gaps here and there, which is understandable. The history of the two rival factions are adequately explained, though not in much detail.What surprised me was the wittiness and humour. There were many witty lines, (including some from the Autobots!), and hilarious situations, often causing the entire cinema to break out in fits of laughter. These scenes served to break up the action and dramatics, and were well-inserted.Of course, there's the necessary love story and the resident hot babe, ala Megan Fox. She does the job well as Mikaela Banes, but she's mostly there because of her features. Shia Lebeouf does a reasonable job as Sam, while Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel, Rachael Taylor, and John Turturro did admirably as the Secretary of Defense, Sergeant Lennox, Maggie Madsen and Agent Simmons, respectively.Will there be a Transformers 2? Only time will tell... but if it's anything as good as this, and as action-packed as this, I'll be among the first to catch it!","Jul 5, 2007",8,/10
"Michael Bay knows how to do action sequences. Unfortunately, his abilities end there. There were multiple problems with this movie. First, the transformers talking like they're hip was just stupid. Which brings me to my next point, it tried too hard to be funny, and therefore wasn't very funny at all. Also, what's the deal with focusing so much on the humans? Aren't the transformers supposed to be the stars of a movie called Transformers? Finally, the movie was just plain too long. This type of story should not require any more than 2 hours. Other than those problems this was a great movie!","Nov 16, 2007",4,/10

So i was concerned that me, being a girl it would be just action-full and somewhat boring. Just a lot of blowing up or objects, and fight scenes.

"Granted, this is supposed to be an action film based on a range of toys. On that level I suppose it delivers the goods. However, for a budget of some $145 million, it shouldn't have been the be all and end all. There ought to have been at least some semblance of plot to go with it.In the right place and well-executed, action sequences are no bad thing, but by the final act of this film I was yawning. The relentless onslaught of one battle after another is simply mind-numbing. The CG Transformers, while realised proficiently, are nothing new: there's a car ad by Citroen that's been running in the UK for ages now, which features a transforming/dancing/skating car. It was easily on a par with anything this film had to offer, so there was hardly a 'Wow!' factor.Michael Bay seems content with his limitations as a maker of overblown, plot-lite action spectaculars. If he wishes to be taken seriously as a filmmaker, he needs to work out what elicits genuine emotion from an audience, and start substituting some story for his stunts.","Dec 4, 2007",3,/10
"When you tune in for a Michael bay movie, you know what to expect and you get that.The technical department of this movie deserves all the praise. I am watching this movie in 2023 and this movie was released in 2007, the visual effects and special effect doesn't feel jarring at all. The movie would still work if the same print was released this year. The best scenes in the movie is obviously the transformation scenes of the vehicles, the sound they use in the movie while showing the transformations and the detailing, all praise to the technical team. Michael bay always has mazing vision in executing action sequences, be it ""ambulance"" or ""13 hours"" (my favorite Michael bay movie) he always finds new camera angles and stylish shots which gives me such an adrenalin rush. People usually complain about Michael bay movies being senseless action, but i feel he always justifies his action in the story. All the actors give amazing performance. The music is amazing. A really good alien invasion action movie.","Jan 27, 2023",8,/10
"I for one thought this was a fantastic movie.Overall although the scripting was pretty weak, that's hardly the focus of a movie about giant robotic sentient machines that can transform into cars. The whole movie had me enthralled, as a matter of fact, and anyone who thinks I'm a bad movie critic can suck on it. I thought the plot was at least reminiscent of the show, and pretty much summed up the feeling of what Bay and Spielberg were trying to convey - a conflict that puts humans in the crossfire and manages to get them thoroughly involved at the same time.Shia LaBeouf did much better than I expected, acting-wise, and Megan Fox did a decent job as well. If people are going to movies like this to find some sort of higher meaning or truth in the plot, why the hell bother watching it? Go see other popcorn flicks like the Matrix if that's really what you're after. And hey, the movie definitely had it's share of philosophical rambling, mostly on the part of Optimus Prime. But this begs the question - WHO CARES WHEN YOU'VE GOT A GIANT COMBAT SCENE BETWEEN ROBOTS GOING ON IN FRONT OF YOU? What amuses me the most is that Independence Day was far worse as far as plot and dialogue go, and yet the same people whining about Transformers are the ones who go gaga over Independence Day and its ""philosophical truths"". Yeah real philosophical, bunch of aliens out to wipe the planet of all life. You know, Bay creates movies like these to please the audience... not to bloody make people think.People either take movies too seriously or they take themselves too seriously. Sometimes it's a good idea to just sit back and enjoy.","Jul 14, 2007",8,/10
Used to watch transformers a lot when i was little so theres a bunch of nostalgia there. Amazing visual effects and music and audio production. Its diffrent to watch it now older then it was as a child. But all in all a great block buster with a solid story and amazing effects.,"Nov 2, 2021",9,/10

"Okay, So as the title suggests and if you haven't seen the film yet, the CG is pretty much the cornerstone of this movie. While it probably will blow you away, the novelty eventually wears off and then you wonder: hey, where did the plot go?! But then your attention is quickly drawn back by a giant robot slamming into an office block - or a wonderfully shot car chase; probably some of the most impressive action sequences to ever grace the silver screen.A hefty dose of cheese seems to have been added to the movie, but most of it can be laughed off. One particular scene was reminiscent of the fighter jet in the movie Stealth downloading songs off the internet. A few loose ends in the thin story probably suggest a sequel is coming - but how can anyone have a problem with that! It has its laughs (even if some are cheap) but the 2.5 hours go fast; I'm sure most people will leave the cinema on a high note. Hopefully this movie gets Bay the credit The Island didn't.And a postscript for hardcore Transformers geeks: go with your expectations at your ankles because you're probably going to cringe when something isn't as it should be (although even a minor fan like myself noticed a lack of original transformation noises). But on the whole this movie has plenty more to offer, and appeals to many more people.","May 28, 2016",9,/10
"About 1 year ago, when I saw a teaser of Transformers, my first instinct was that this movie was going to be lackluster at best. I had that same mindset until a couple of weeks ago when I saw an amazing trailer in the theater for the movie. This trailer was so great, it swayed my whole mindset and I actually became very eager to watch this movie. Fast forward to last night. From the opening of the movie, the disappointment began. The plot is very disappointing. Even the all-star cast could not improve this movie. The CGI was definitely groundbreaking and amazing for the most part. However, it was over the top at times especially during fight scenes between Transformers. There was so much CGI, i couldn't tell which Transformer was which and what they were doing. There were an excessive amount of attempts at slapstick humor and comic relief which inevitably made this movie overall Corny. Micheal Bay is definitely a great director in the action genre, but it is clear that in this movie, he placed too much emphasis on the CGI and paid little attention and provided lackluster effort in the area of Plot. The considerable amount of explosions, crashes and action sequences fail to distract the moviegoer from the fact that the movie was extremely disappointing.","Jul 4, 2007",4,/10
"I wasn't going to watch this film because it sounded like such a cheesy cash-in of all the other comic book and 80s cartoon revival films going around. Which technically it was. I'd heard it was a no-brainer with great special effects. Luckily I love enormous CGI, and someone else had bought it so I watched it for the hell of it. And loved it!I wasn't disappointed by the visual effects - they are tremendous! So good, in fact, that the detail sometimes makes the fight scenes confusing - more so than watching LOTR The Two Towers from the front row of the cinema! But why I enjoyed it so much wasn't down to the graphics, but the dialogue - shocking but true. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen which in no way professed to be a comedy! For starters, one of the Transformers is a bright yellow Chevrolet sent to protect our young Shia LaBeouf - though apparently not from getting laid! I hadn't realised the Transformers came to Earth in order to become match-makers. Anyone ever tell them three's a crowd?OK, I was initially right and this is a completely formulaic story wrapped around a load of mouldy cheese; an old plot rehashed and straining for some kind of deep and meaningful backstory - at least in any scenes involving the Autobots and Decepticons (see how I was paying attention?). As long as the robots don't talk, you've got a great movie. Really. The dialogue was cringe-inducing, but only from the Transformers themselves. The human characters were fine. Better than fine. Bloody well funny, I say!Also a little note about how styles of acting change over the years: Look back at a film from the 1930s and you'd be forgiven for thinking it a little OTT. (But they all came from the theatre, so we can forgive them.) More recently - and as this film seems to show - we're getting into the truly ""natural"" side of acting, where people DO talk over the top of each other when arguing, or joking, or simply behaving as normal people do. In reality people don't wait for one person to stop talking before saying something - that is truly reading lines from a set script. But I think actors are now trying to sound genuine on screen.However, It doesn't always work, sometimes it's confusing and distorted unless you have an ear for it. I'm putting this in as a warning, because I watched this with my mum and dad and got different reactions. Dad was fine - thought it was hysterical and loved the explosions. Boom boom. But my mother struggled with everything, and in the end believed she must be entirely out of touch with the world because they seemed to be speaking a different language to her. I suggested she was just old and going deaf as well as not being down with the kids. She told me to get stuffed. But anyway, just a warning in case you have that era problem where you can't discern one voice from a crowd: the party-effect, or whatever.But for anyone else - as long as you don't take the film seriously, you'll enjoy it emmensely. Forget the awful moral message delivered by the robots and just giggle your socks off!","Aug 15, 2014",8,/10
"The first movie in this franchise holds a special place in my heart and is undoubtedly one of the best films I've ever watched. I had the pleasure of experiencing this cinematic gem in 2014, and it left a lasting impression on me. There are several aspects of this movie that I truly cherished:**1. Story - A Masterpiece:**
The heart of this movie lies in its exceptional storytelling. The plot was not just good; it was exceptional. I hesitate to reveal too much of the story to avoid spoilers, but I can confidently say it's one of my all-time favorites. The narrative is filled with intrigue, emotion, and thrilling twists that keep you hooked from start to finish.**2. Outstanding CGI:**
The movie's use of CGI is nothing short of remarkable. While there might have been some mixed opinions about Optimus Prime's design, I personally found it wonderful. The CGI in this film creates a visually stunning world, bringing the Transformers and their battles to life in a way that's awe-inspiring. The attention to detail and the realism achieved through CGI is a testament to the dedication of the filmmakers.**3. Alternative Forms:**
One of the standout features of this film is the selection of alternative forms for the Transformers, particularly Bumblebee. The choice of alternative forms, including Bumblebee's, is something that resonated with me and has become one of my favorite aspects of the movie. Bumblebee's form, in particular, is both visually appealing and meaningful in the context of the story. This decision added depth and uniqueness to the character.In conclusion, the first installment of this franchise is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to hold a special place in my heart. The exceptional storytelling, remarkable CGI, and the thoughtful selection of alternative forms make it a standout film. It's no wonder that, even years after its release, this movie remains one of the best in the franchise. I could write much more about the film's characters, the stunning visual effects, and the impact it had on the larger cinematic landscape, but it's the kind of movie that's best experienced first-hand. If you haven't watched it, I highly recommend giving it a view and experiencing the magic for yourself.","Oct 22, 2023",9,/10

"Just viewed this piece of scrap and find it hard to believe the rating it received on IMDb. Are most of the viewers tweens, mindless ignoramuses or a combination of both. The screenplay is utter nonsense (those writers should have remained on strike!) and were it not for the special effects( ah! Hollywood's redeeming gadget) and the huge budget that only America can afford, this would be a total disaster. As such it is an almost-total disaster. Shame on you Steven Spielberg for such money-grabbing drivel- you prove that Megatron has more of a conscience than Hollywood.

I guarantee you'll enjoy it.Shia LeBouf was the perfect cast for Sam Witwicki. I wasn't the biggest fan of having pretty girls showboated for straight males, but I get why they did it. Cast is phenomenal with actors such as Jon Voigt and Tyrese amongst many joining the franchise from the start.I will always treasure these movies from now until my time expires and I hope future generations watch these films so science-fiction and comic book film adaptations live on forever.One can only wish.

"Initially, when I heard of a Transformers movie being created, I had low hopes. For some reason this year, I gave way to reason, and developed high hopes. My recent turn around appears to have been in vain. Transformers has been transformed too far beyond the original story/concept.The Transformers movie is simply....(1) The most fantastic piece of CGI work I have ever seen.(2) Excellent action.(3) Worthless story. Does not respect G1 series as Bay claimed it would. The main keys of the original series G1 story(from G1 series to movie to G1 after movie series) were far superior to anything that Bay can conceive apparently. So why try to reinvent it?(4) Extremely poor characterization. In fact, what character developments exists beyond some of the human characters? Perhaps Bay intended for the fans to remember the characterization from the original series and movie. However, this can not work, as the story/history is completely changed in this new movie. Nothing(except for some names and very basic appearances, and some silly catch lines) is the same.The movie seems to be about humans and the problems of Earth because of the Transormers arrival, not about the Transformers themselves. A substantial portion of the movie in the beginning is entirely about a human's life (Sam) without introducing Transformer characterization.I am convinced that Bay should never be allowed to direct another film in entirety after seeing this. He is a 1st class action director. I think that he should be brought in specifically for action scenes, but not for an entire film.This movie was far too long. After about an hour and a half, I only remained seated because I was with another person. I just wanted the movie to end after that point. Don't get me wrong, I love long movies. Long movies with entertaining stories/plots. For *pure* comedy and *pure* action, the shorter the better in my book.I am not a hardcore TF fan that can tell you everything that happened in every EP of the series. But I was a fan when I was a kid and owned quite a few of the toys at that time. I remember most of the key plot points of the G1 story arc. For me, to see this extreme deviation from I remember was just another black eye on the film. But, I realize that Hollywood movies rarely follow the original story arc of what they were based upon. I don't know why this is true, however. I can understand editing out parts for time content of what can be shown in a short time. I can not understand changing everything for the mere purpose of changing everything.I will give the film 5 stars. But for me, the star rating is linear. 5 is a 50 percent mark. It means this movie is halfway between horrible and excellent. Absolute middle of the road. Mediocre. I usually find no entertainment value, personally, in mediocre films.","Aug 9, 2007",5,/10
"The TV series JAG (1995-2005) is my all-time favorite TV series. In reruns I just watched the episode titled ""Black Ops"" (4/10/95), At about the 52-min point (with commercials), a Navy Seal asks another Seal ""who said 'I will fight no more forever?'"" The responding Seal said ""I don't know."" The asking Seal said ""I don't know either."" When I first watched this episode in 1995, the question didn't mean anything to me - just banter.Fast forward to 2007. I was watching the just released action movie titled ""Transformers."" Near the beginning of the movie we see an Osprey aircraft full of military special forces returning from a mission of some sort. They're making small talk and get around to playing a game of ""who said these words?"" The game ends with the unanswered quiz question (by Josh Duhamel), ""who said I will fight no more forever?"" This time I knew the answer. Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce.I knew the answer because earlier this century, as part of a vacation throughout Northern California, Oregon and Idaho, I ran across the Chief Joseph Nez Percce museum where I learned the story of the heroic 1400-mile running battle with the U. S. Army from his homeland in present-day Oregon, to near the Canadian border before laying down his weapons and vowing to ""fight no more forever.""","Oct 7, 2022",9,/10

I was blown away at the start of the year by Spiderman 3 ...and now this... this film has blown even that out of the water! It could even be the best film I have EVER seen! The special effects are out of this world! When watching this, we got goosebumps..and I wasn't even a massive transformers fan to begin with. Even tho the effects are amazing, the movie wouldn't have been half as good without the fantastic writing of the script. The lead role in this movie (guy from 'Even Stephens') is really funny and perfectly casted for the role. I think the producers were spot on only releasing a tiny part of the films footage in the trailers that came out last year because it really built up the anticipation of the film! I can honestly FULLY recommend this film to EVERYONE of all ages. Any person who has a negative view of this movie is just envious of their amazing success! This, to me, is the best movie of our time. :-)","Aug 4, 2007",10,/10
"First, I never watched the cartoon or bought any of the merchandising when I was growing up. I was excited to see the movie anyway. The only two redeeming aspects of the movie are Megan Fox and the appearance of the new Chevy Camero. Both are hot!!! Shia LaBeouf plays a very obnoxious teenager that is full of too much talk. I got tired of him right from the beginning. I saw that same character in ""I, Robot"". The movie also has the typical drawn out action/chase sequences where everything gets destroyed (buildings, cars, etc).I did like some of the attempts at humor. The Transformers themselves were pretty cool. I just thought the movie was completely formula and the acting and dialog was terrible. If the movie was from the viewpoint of the Transformers instead of Shia LaBeaouf's character, maybe the film would have been better.","May 22, 2008",2,/10

Sure the Transformers part are more exciting than the human parts and that's exactly the type of movie Transformers was, a type of movie where people are watching it because they just wanna see a bunch of giant robots punching and shooting each other, and if that's the case for a film critic at in the end i'm pretty sure they will give the film a negative, well in this case, the humans are actually for me are likeable and convincing enough to make both side almost perfectly equal and stable, i like Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox in here, their love relationship was a whatever for me not that it's anything bad but it just whatever, i like them more as a partner not a couple, and the rest of the cast was also great, the humans sort of bad guy of the film played by John Turturro was incredible, and of course the Autobots, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and the rest was cool, Transformers human story and characters are likeable and convincing enough to make me still care about them and it works fine, the whole Transformers part are super well executed with great visual effect, incredible cinematography, lot's of explosion, exciting, and super solid final battle even though how they end Megatron was kinda underwhelming for me, nit picky here and there, but pretty good soundtrack, so overall Transformers is still a solid movie and i will see what comes next.","Dec 28, 2022",8,/10

"This movie was not a cinematic classic or an award winner but it was a great movie experience. If you grew up loving transformers you will get goosebumps when you first see and hear Optimus Prime. Yes, there was some cheesiness but its a movie based on toys!! This movie was not perfect but it was worth the money which I wouldn't say about many movies considering the cost of tickets now. Seeing it on the big screen definitely made a difference. Tons of great action, some cheesy humor, a surprisingly decent storyline(I was expecting a terrible storyline) and a dream come true for me since I was about 8. Of course the best part of this movie, Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus Prime. So great. I loved this movie.","Jul 7, 2007",9,/10
"After buying his first car, gawky high-school nerd Sam (Shia Leboef) learns he has actually stumbled across Bumblebee, one of the transforming 'autobots' from planet cybertron. He is there to warn off an impending attack from the decepticons, an evil brand of transformer, who are hell-bent on launching an all-out invasion. Together he teams up with high school sex-goddess, borderline lap dancer, Mikaela (played by Megan Fox who looks a lot older than most high school girls). The original series of Transformers was nothing special, but admittedly had charm. Michael Bay's latest crime against cinema takes that charm, and turns it into a great big two hour advert for a mobile phone. Every girl who shows up just happens to look like Paris Hilton, and you could probably fill a beach with the amount of gruff dirt and manly sweat dripping from the eyebrows of our beloved human heroes. Even the action is underwhelming, devoid of menace or subtlety to underplay the visual vasectomy that your eyes will suffer from. The only redeeming quality is Shia Leboef, who is so charmingly funny amid the preposterousness of the actual Transformers, almost validating the movie's ballooned sense of silliness.","Dec 23, 2007",5,/10
"This is an enjoyable ""leave your brain out of the door"" type of movie that tried to give an updated version of one of the loved cartoons of the 80s. For a ""TRUE"" fan of the franchise (and not just G1), the updates were impressive and grows on you (would you rather see them in their ""Beast Wars"" identities? ...shivering...). Besides, during the course of the cartoons, many changes were made along the way and some are bad, but some are also cool.Going back to the movie. The robots should have have more on-screen time where the Autobots should have been the heroes saving the world and us humans from being obliterated by the Decepticons. The robots should not be subject to giving out too much comedic reliefs (respect, people!). Too much focus on Sam (Should have changed the title to Sam and the Transformers) and the ""sentient being""'s side. That the plot was a rip off of Independence Day also added to the down side of the movie.Respecting the source material, a good story, and awesome CGI pays more dividends. (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Spiderman 1..ok and 2) So I gave it a 6, because the effects were wicked; Shia's acting was impressive as well as John Turturro's; and Optimus Prime's voice IS Optimus Prime. Megatron would have been cooler if he was a tank and had more meaningful things to say.","Jul 6, 2007",8,/10
"This is a very poor conversion to live action. I have always been a fan of Transformers in all their many and varied guises as cartoon but this live action attempt just does not do them justice. The only saving grace is the spectacular special effects. The start of the film gives so much promise. Then it is all downhill. Overall the acting was weak, Shia LeBouef and Megan Fox can be justifiably embarrassed at this poor attempt to mix action and comedy. The plot is poor,obvious and confused at the same time with so many annoyances I found myself yelling ""What??"" . The slapstick comedy routines of the Autobots were almost embarrassing. Very disappointing. I found myself looking forward to the transformers transformation scenes just because there was nothing else worth giving any attention to. As a vehicle for demonstrating modern special effects this is a good film; as anything else it is a waste of time. Could have been so much better. And finally, BumbleBee is a Volkswagen NOT a rusty American Camaro.","Sep 17, 2007",3,/10
"Michael Bay excels at action at a fast pace with underlying comedic cues which heavily influence the enjoyment of the audience. In this film, he shines his brightest. Based on the popular cartoon, the Transformers in the movie are big beyond the screen's size and the explosions and action are neck breaking. Shia LaBeouf's expressions of surprise and wonder are unique to this film and lacking in most of the others. Megan Fox does a fine job as well. The introduction to the robots is funny and the entirety of the film is at least amusing if not very engaging for the viewer. It's one of the better action films to come out, ever.","Jun 26, 2023",9,/10

"So, okay, I guess I'm the only one who's not a critic who didn't like this movie. I'll be honest, this movie was a big disappointment, and my least favorite of the summer so far. Transformers delivered on its promise of stunning action and visual effects. The opening sequence in Qatar was literally jaw-dropping. My friend next to me had to push my mouth back up. Absolutely stunning. The final 45 minutes were also full of jaw-dropping visual effects, the most amazing shot being Optimus and Megatron flying through a building in downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately, there's another hour and twenty minutes of the movie that we have to sit through. The plot for this movie is barely enough to cover two hours, let alone close to two and a half. The Decepticons are evil and want to use the Allspark to turn Earth into their new empire. The Autobots have to stop them. That's it. So Bay fills the rest of the movie with total filler material that's about as necessary as the cannibal island in Pirates 2 (meaning completely unnecessary). There is almost no characterization for any of the main characters. There is no depth or motivation for any character. Sam wants to score. Mikaela is there for eye candy. The Sector 7 agent is there for humor only (not to mention poorly executed humor). The Secretary of Defense is there to have a veteran actor on board. The chick hacker is there for eye candy. And that's just the humans. The Transformers have no character development whatsoever. They're giant five-story tall robots that transform into cars and blow things up. Nothing more. There are no relationships explored between robots. The closest we come to character development for them is Megatron's line, ""You fail me yet again, Starscream."" That's it. In the final battle sequence, I found myself disinterested because I didn't care who won. I didn't really care if any of them died. No motivation was explored on either side. It was just Autobots vs. Decepticons. That's just boring. Another thing. I'm able to suspend belief for movies if I have to. I'm a seasoned 24 viewer. But I can't throw believability out the window. Come on. A five-story robot literally pissing on some guy. Give me a freaking break. It's hard enough even accepting that there are five- story tall robots that transform into cars. When you have them do really stupid things like that, you destroy any possible credibility that the movie may have. Bay also tries to insert campy humor into the movie. He fails miserably. The only time I laughed while watching the movie was when the soldier (don't know his name) in Qatar was on the phone with the operator who was asking him about a credit card. That was it. The cheesy humor puts more nails in the grave marked ""Credibility and Believability"". Finally, we have this massive battle in downtown Los Angeles. Massive death, destruction, and mayhem. And in the end, the government buries the evidence and goes about their normal business. Come on! Like you could cover that up. That's like trying to cover up the destruction of the White House. It's just not possible. Completely impossible. That put the credibility coffin six feet under. So, in the end, this movie focuses on eye candy and nothing else. The effects are eye- popping and jaw dropping. But eye candy will not float a film. To get a really good and entertaining film, you need: 1) characters you care about 2) a plot that is more than twenty words when boiled down 3) stunning action (on which Transformers delivers 4) believability and credibility And all Transformers has is eye candy. It is certainly not ""more than meets the eye"". 3/10.You also know it's not good when one of the trailer you see (1-18-08) is as memorable as the movie itself. If you want a great action movie this summer, go see Live Free or Die Hard or The Bourne Ultimatum.","Apr 14, 2008",4,/10
"Transformers is an explosively fantastic over-the-top action film, filled with an abundance of characters and delivering on gripping action that is littered with explosions.The performances are entertaining, regardless of their varying quality, with the best coming from the voice acting work from Hugo Weaving and Peter Cullen, who are each immensely powerful as Megatron and Optimus Prime, respectively. Sam makes for a mostly compelling point-of-view for the audience, and Shia LaBeof plays him with a strangely manic and awkwardly comedic direction that works well. Megan Fox as Mikaela was very much cast primarily to play a more 'physically enticing' character, and at the very least she gets the job done just fine. The rest of the absolutely stacked cast such as Josh Duhamel, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro, and many more round out the several sub-plots that run relatively smoothly alongside one another and converge in a mostly satisfying fashion. Furthermore, it's appreciated that the Cybertronians themselves are featured in the spotlight to an admittedly but understandably limited degree, with more than enough fun interactions between the Autobots and thrilling battles with several Decepticons. Moreover, the CGI used to bring them all to fruition is revolutionary to say the least, looking as if they are all actually there interacting with the sets and characters. This leads to the other strongest aspect of the film; the action, which is so over-glamorised and extreme that it's an absolute blast to witness the Autobot-Decepticon rivalry unfold in live-action. And the score was a very powerful aspect that moves you and evokes much more emotion than the film probably has any right to intentionally include.That all said, there are some laughable aspects to the movie, such as the melodrama and teen-angst drive between Sam and Mikaela, which either comes off as weird and awkward at best and almost totally unconvincing at worst. The film's runtime flies by for people who enjoy it, but for others it is overextended by perhaps the inclusion of too many stories. And some of the humour regarding Sam's parents and other minor lines of dialogue feel questionable as to why they were included in the first place.Regardless, Transformers is an awesome action fiesta that does a brilliant job at bringing the robots in disguise into the live-action format and succeeds in taking audiences on an entertaining thrill ride.","Nov 1, 2024",8,/10

"It's been 21 years since ""The Transformers: The Movie"" debuted, now this live action version of the classic Good Vs. Evil action. There are two factions fighting: The Autobots lead by Optimus Prime(Peter Cullen) who protect the humans from the Decepticons lead by Megatron, who's bent on world domination. In this movie, the action has taken to a whole new level. There's this goofy, geeky teen named Sam(Shia LaBeouf) who gets a old yellow Chevy Camaro that has a surprise he'll never forget. The Camaro is an alien robot named Bumblebee(in the cartoon he was a Volkswagon) and he did a very good job of taken care of Sam. Then later, more Autobots come to help Bumblebee: Jazz; he was a smooth-talking and hip car. Ironhide; tough as nails, ready to kick some serious Decepticon butt. Ratchet; very medical-wise. And last but not least, the leader Optimus Prime. The action of the movie was non-stop, and the comedy was all there. That helped balance the act of this movie, compared to the cartoons. This movie is off the hook, the cast is super, the storyline is one of a kind! Not kid friendly, though it's old-school to me. This movie can go on for generations. AUTOBOTS, TRANSFORM! AND ROLL OUT! Rating 5 stars!","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10
"""Utter Garbage"" those words I have to use these days to describe Hollywood movies that come out so often. Before I start let me say that I had transformer toys when I was young, and I know what a huge potential the transformer movie could be.But now with :'Garbage' that fills Hollywood 'rubbish' directors, 'filthy' movie companies You can turn a nice car into a scarp garbage that you find in a junk yard, that's exactly what the film does, it turns a mega movie story into a junk yard garbage.","Nov 5, 2010",1,/10
"Okay, just saw the movie. Have been waiting for this movie a long time now. Ever since i heard is was coming out i was kind of skeptical. Then i heard Spielberg would be producing and Bay directing. For all those Autobot and Deception fans from the '80. Anyways almost immediately action once the movie starts, it never got boring and some super awesome CGI. After i left the cinema the first question i asked myself was, wen will part 2 be out......Transformers.........................................WOW.P.S.Hasbro/GM is gonna make a fortune.....","Jun 30, 2007",10,/10

"First And Foremost.. Get over the semantic details of the cartoon. People are going to hate on this movie for the same stupid reasons the hate on any conversion to the big screen.Secondly, when watching the movie, enjoy as if it is a second child hood for you... Not a cynical critic. If you do both of these then I ensure you'll be extremely pleased with this movie.The plot was well laid out and moved at a good speed without rushing or dragging. While it had a 'romance' throughout it wasn't over the top or forced, which a lot of movies tend to do.The transformations were awesome, again, was just like reliving my child hood! They did this very well with them transiting from car/plane to robot.The storyline itself was very well done, clearly set out, and was a great mix of comedy, action and ""emotion"".All in all I think they did an excellent job of translating transformers to the big screen and live action, as I say if you've decided that you won't like it before you're even in the cinema don't bother, but otherwise this movie is well worth the viewing.","Jun 27, 2007",10,/10
"I must admit I wasn't expecting anything much out of this movie. After seeing failures such as Fantastic Four, for instance, I've come to the conclusion that most comic-based movies fail to deliver. While you certainly cannot expect a twisting storyline, you can expect a catching movie - especially the fighting. It's mainly an action-entertainment movie, and while I usually dislike the normal boom-boom action-type movies with no regard for a decent plot whatsoever, I *did* enjoy Transformers as I can only describe it as 'cool'.There are subtle details that I also enjoyed, for instance Bumblebee's gesturing and some various comments. Overall I enjoyed this movie, and I was impressed - however, you shouldn't try and take it all that seriously, I, myself, was laughing through some of the scenes (though the younger audience seemed to absorb them with full seriousness) and the fighting scenes, particularly due to the transformers' superiority over humans. If you decide to see this film, go watch it while it's still in the theater.","Jul 4, 2007",9,/10
"Okay, probably not, but firstly, let me say this movie gave me chills up my spine the first time I saw it. It is beautiful. The special effects were absolutely breathtaking. That's where it ends in terms of top quality film making.This movie is silly, it's big, loud, over budgeted, overblown, over-everything, riddled with stereotypes (which really p*ssed me off sometimes) however it's damned good fun. And it's funny. The acting is good - Shia Labouf definitely has acting chops, as do the rest of the cast - a mixture of big names and unknowns in acting, music & modeling and the story.. well don't expect anything overly original, but in the end, it probably doesn't matter. The music is great - big orchestral sounds accompanied by choir although there are sequences accompanied by rock which kind came from left field and really annoyed me. The plot line does get muddled up - the editing is pretty ordinary and lets the movie down a little, but in the end, it's the Tranformers and their cannons that really get me going.They look fan-tiddly-astic - Optimus and Bumblebee are the only two who really get any character development, which kinda sucks, but, hey, it's official - two more sequels to go, so there's always hope. The actual action sequences - incredible, BUT, I had to see it a second time around, because everything moves so damn fast and camera is so damn shaky that, for me, it was really impossible to really see anything and the first time I saw it I actually got bored during the final battle, which meant the ending came about pretty abruptly and basically the movie fell flat on its face.But the second time 'round, is much better - you have more of an inkling where to look during the action sequences and everything is a helluva lot more coherent.Overall, awesome movie. Loved the transformers, the chicks and the cars (and that badass truck that is Optimus Prime). A great Saturday night out at the movies.","Jun 30, 2007",8,/10
"Before I went to see this movie I had heard so much good about it. 'Brilliant action sequences, good story and funny.' I thought this would be one of the best movies I would ever see, it had everything! The movie didn't follow up at all, it was so disappointing I almost left the cinema. The only thing that stopped me was the final fight scene towards the end of the film.My reasons for saying this is that the story was lame and silly, the actors didn't sell their roll to me and it was NOT funny at all. It felt weak and just like another 'cutsie' routine actioner. I feel that this movie is made for children and didn't deserve the 'M' rating it got in Australia.If you want a family movie that could possibly keep you interested, this is it. But otherwise it's not worth it.","May 30, 2008",2,/10
"In the eighties there was an animated series on television called Transformers. In the eighties I was a kid. Unhampered by the things that make an adult life so boring at times I liked the series. Somewhere in 2006 the trailers for a Transformers film were released and I could be nothing but skeptical. For who would the film be made? The kids of the eighties or the kids of the current era? Driven by curiosity I decided to go and see for myself, by seeing the film. It turned out to be one of the better choices I've made this year.The film is very clearly based on the animated series: the same set of characters, the same story line, the same idea basically. It works as well as it does because it combines the raw action of the robots clashing together in war with the fact that it doesn't take itself very serious. In fact, it doesn't take itself serious at all, often using self deprecating tag lines between the rampaging action sequences.In effect, it works like a charm. It's a good barrel of laughs with plenty of CGI based action, most of which is worked out well enough not to cause too much friction on the viewer. So, there you have it. Simple minded but effective action with a good laugh in it.8 out of 10 rampaging robots in disguise","Jul 10, 2007",8,/10
"I very rarely comment on a film but I feel compelled to comment on this one. I am not a Transformers fan of the original series. I'm not going to write a long comment about how it is not like the series. This film has to be one of the most poorly constructed and disjointed films I have seen in a while. The problems with this film begins and ends with Michael Bay. The spinning crane and staid-cam shots which he constantly employs, in slow motion, completely distract from the story. The constant use of loud dramatic music, music that sounds identical to that in Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys II, is also overdone and inappropriate. I found that there were many plot holes, that interesting characters were never used effectively, that characters seemed to suddenly do things without reason, that monologues were used instead of action to tell the story.I gave this film 3 stars because of the CG employed. This was the one area of the film that was outstanding. The transition from live film to CG was almost flawless. It seems that this was the main focus of the film making process and it is a pity that the rest of the story suffers as a result. With a better script and a different director this could have been a really amazing film.","Jul 29, 2007",3,/10
"As an '80's baby, I can safely say that one of my favorite cartoons was Transformers. This movie is ""OFF THE HOOK"". It's exciting and loud, and funny, and Optimus Prime is still ""The Robot"". Hugo Weaving makes a perfect Megatron (although there just isn't enough of him). Tyrese is Hot and the kid who plays the hero, is absolutely adorable. There is nothing not to like about this movie except for the fact that in the soundtrack you will hear music from ""The Terminator"", ""Armageddon"" and ""The Matrix"" (come on Mr. Bay, all that money and you couldn't get a better score?). All in all, I'd have to say that (and it makes me sad) that it was better than Spiderman 3.","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10

"This movie was amazing... I got to see it in the theatre over a week before it was released and it lived up to the lofty expectations that I had set as a Transformers fan. This movie has the best special effects I have ever seen. There may be some movies that are on the same level (like Lord of the Rings), but none is better. This movie shows where special effects is going in the future. Michael Bay is a genius... if they could do a three picture deal (which is rumored), I pray that it will live up to this one. The movie itself was great. Acting was impressive. There was humor and comedy throughout, which is a nice change of pace. The love story did not interfere with the movie, in fact it was nice to see. The only thing I would have changed about this movie is that Starscream and Megatron and Barricade did not have more to do with the movie. This movie is a must see in the box office (at least once); and you must own a Blu-ray or HDDVD player when this movie makes it out. It is that good.","Jul 2, 2007",10,/10
"OK, I'm probably an idiot for expecting more from a movie about robots from outer space that can re-form themselves into (coincidently) earthmen-designed cars and trucks of this period. (It's true, they leave a flimsy ""out"" for this unlikeliness). As a lad, I confess I thought the whole transformer thing peculiar, albeit creative.Outstanding CGI to be sure -- one requirement fulfilled. The positives end there. I found the movie ham-handed and reliant on volume and hyper-kinetic camera work. Bay has a way of pummeling his audience. Much has been touted about how much great action is in this movie. But I came away feeling less like I had seen this all before, and more like this time I was forced to lie on my back while giant robots emptied trashcans full of everything I've seen before on my writhing body. Maybe that's what people like about the movie? On the human side, Transformers is chock full of predictable caricatures acted with...well, zero nuance. I can just see Michael Bay directing his cast ""Try it again -- this time even more goofy!"" (More cowbell!) Some people found Shia LaBeouf's performance great. To each his own. A barely interesting point:counterpoint is his over-the-top mugging contrasted with his leading-lady's glazed vapidness. Not sure what John Voight was thinking by taking this role. Maybe he had a good time. His call.Finally, Michael Bay seems to think upping the contrast and saturation in post production is some sort of clever art form. Looks more like Photoshop 101. I was totally open to enjoying a movie about Transformers. But besides the fun CGI, I didn't. Hey, what do I know? Bay keeps making millions...and millions. And that worries me.","Nov 20, 2007",2,/10
"Just went to see this movie last night. Overall it was FANTASTIC! IT's true that the storyline was a little flat, but well don't forget it has to cater to a large part of the audience--KIDS. As an adult, I also thoroughly enjoyed the movie, didn't want to miss a scene...until I HAD TO GO, which is something I now regret. I'll definitely watch it again in theatre, even if they decided to charge twice as much. That's how money-well-spent this movie is! Just can't wait for the release of the DVD version. A MUST BUY! You may have noticed I didn't mention anything about the special effects. If you think SUPERMAN RETURNS was any good, TRANSFOMERS is at least 10 times better! The best to date, and next year's Academy Award winner for sure!","Jun 29, 2007",9,/10
"Oh dear, really oh dear.I mean I didn't expect much; I kind of hoped it would be OK, but Jesus it was bad.Special Effects were good, I must say not exceptional, but good and lots of them. However plot, acting, plausibility, and story, pretty much anything that makes a film worthwhile was non-existent.As I couldn't give a crap about anybody in this comical tale I didn't even get through the 144 minutes, way too long. I will point out that I am not 3 years old, which of course is the intended audience demographic for this trash, so I guess I am missing the proverbial point.I might be getting old (redundant statement as we all are), but this is not a film it's a special effects extravaganza (wow I can spell that), the ridiculous comical relief scene's when they hide in the garden, shows the film makers didn't really care too much either about any plausibility.Had a couple of drinks as I am writing so my English might not be the best.Glossy, Pretty, expensive and silly, but still crap.1/10","Sep 24, 2007",1,/10

And i know that the word ""Michael Bay"" means bad luck, but this is an good if not great if not awesome film! It's as if Michael Bay learns a thing or two from Spielberg and the likes of 'redeemed' directors like Martin Campbell.It's just a pure awesome, balls-filled, pure=-fun piece of masterpiece that's going to land in the top 10 of AFI's 100 Movies list for a decade from now. It's like witnessing a Muse concert. It's just fricking mental! And i, as a Transformers fan enjoyed this film and believe that Bay didn't ruin my childhood, instead he relived it.The action starts with Blackout attacking a US base in Qatar, and ends with all 8 Transformers(4 Autobots & 4 Decepticons) fighting each other in a city. Now that's how a true Transformers style is made! I like how it begins with a Transformers battle, and ends with a Transformers battle. It's just how perfectly planned it is.Overall, this is a 10/10 film for me. Great action, great drama and great stuff of awesomeness that'll pee your pants out.

To someone who watched Transformers as a kid..but by no stretch of the imagination has it MEMORIZED..this was a great rendition of the 'robots in disguise'.The Transformers themselves were incredible!! The speed at which they transformed and the camera work made it a little dizzying to watch at times but that was all part of the ride...the effects were truly amazing...fantastic fight scenes..especially when the Autobots and the Decepticons go at one another..with humans just trying to stay out of the madness!! Shia was great..an excellent human element in the movie..his folks were also priceless as comic relief...Turturro wasn't at his best..but I find that he is a bit of a hit and miss actor..Overall a total roller-coaster ride that had me hooting and hollering in the theatre..definitely will watch this again!!,"Jun 28, 2007",8,/10
I have never been presented with a choice of watching transformers or removing my own face with a blunt spoon but if you ever are i urge you to choose the spoon. I cannot believe Sucre took time away from prison break to appear in it. I cannot believe it has a 7.7 rating. The plot is terrible. The way they speak to each other was a massive cheese fest. This is such a bad movie. Remember the worst film you have ever seen then make it a bit worse and you are somewhere near transformers. Shame on you Sucre.

"Well, to be honest, I have finally completed my list of Worst Movies Ever - and this one is definitely number one.My life has changed thanks to Transformers - now i understand that Power Rangers had GOOD special effects, Anakonda was a GREAT movie, Tom Cruise is an IMPRESSIVE actor and average Brazilian soap opera have FASCINATING plot.But let's put jokes aside. What I consider to be the main problem of the movie is that it doesn't seem to meet any target audience - at least if we divide the audience by age. The plot may be convincing for kids under 13-year old, but several elements are too 'hard' for kids (language, violence, even though it's moderate). So, with PG-13 rating, who was it made for? I guess the answer came from the audience which I met in the cinema - fully armed with popcorn, tacos and active mobiles. Audience which burst into laughter because of ""black-man-with-funny-voice"" or ""agent-gets-undressed"" scenes. The audience which doesn't have any problem with traditional ""nerd-gets-a-bully's-girl-because-he-gets-involved-in-something"" plot.As for the famed special effects - I'm not very up-to-date with computer games, but as far as I remember, I've seen more impressive things in game cut-scenes a few years ago. At least they didn't use machine-gun editing, random camera shaking and hundreds of little elements of steel and concrete flying around to hide the most important part of CGI. How many times did we actually have a chance to see a full robot and its animation? I'm disappointed. I hope Dreamworks has already started lawsuits against the company which made CGI. I hope the writers who decided to connect hundreds of unimportant subplots, empty dialog lines and flat characters have been punished.Ah, I give the movie 2 instead of 1 for ONE SCENE: Megatron hitting a random human on the ground, saying ""Disgusting""...Yes. Disgusting.","Sep 8, 2007",2,/10
"I have got to say Michael Bay truly knows how to make a blockbuster summer movie. With the exception of the Bad Boys movies and Pearl Harbor. He knows how to make a really entertaining film. Michael Bay does a great job of leading up to the Transformers arrival then when they finally show up, they don't disappoint. Peter Cullen's voice really brought back such memories of the cartoon. There was such a sense of urgency and great action scenes in this movie. AND to everyone that finds that Megatron's voice being done by Hugo Weaving is bad, don't fret. You can hardly tell he voiced him. Go see this movie, enjoy.","Jun 30, 2007",8,/10

I think the most important thing of the movie is that the action and special effects don't take over the storyline...so watch and enjoy as Transformers will transform you into thinking maybe 2007's big budget movies can produce the goods!!.....not a 10, because i cant say it was perfect, but a high 9.....i give it heaps of points for just finally giving me something to cheer about from the action titles this year!!!","Jun 28, 2007",9,/10
"A car that turns into a robot. Great idea for a toy; not such a great idea for a film. But the toy was conceived with the idea of it being marketed by a television series; that gave rise to an animated film; and now to this live action remake. If the film was pure sci-fi, it might not be too bad; but the attempt to make a partially human-centric story around these devices, in a semi-real world context, is disastrous, featuring by turn ridiculousness, clichés and product placement (and not just of the Transformers themselves); the film borrows from the conventions of thriller, teen movie and knowing comedy without offering any originality or coherence as it does so. What are on offer are a lot of spectacular special effects, but watching the robots fight over skyscrapers I was reminded of the original 'King Kong'. The special effects of that film were then cutting edge, but now seem primitive; yet the reality depicted in this movie is no more convincing, in spite of the modern graphics, so divorced are the images from any sense of meaning. You can make a fun movie about fighting aliens: 'Independence Day' is a good example, but the concept of 'Transformers' lies wholly in the product, and the narrative justification we get is stretched very thin. If this really is what Hollywood currently considers as premium movie-making, we can only hope that our descendants will first damn, and then forgive us.","Jan 11, 2008",2,/10

"I have been waiting for this movie for almost 4 years, and unlike other anticipated movies such as Pirates, Die Hard and Fantastic 4 rise of silver surfer, Transformers was everything that was expected and more. Seeing it in DLP is the best and only way to see this movie. The picture quality and mind blowing sound of DLP just added to what may be one of the best movies in the last ten years. Yea I said it Lord of the rings got nothing on transformers, Star Wars please! The non-stop action and dramatic visual effects were like a sweet symphony to the eyes. The plot was well written and played; Shia LaBeouf was fantastic and this movie shows how he has grown up as an actor to respect, and along with the other wonderful cast members the movie clicked. This may be the best movie that I have ever seen. I honestly can not think of a better flick. Blows Pirates, all three out of the water literally!

"I would like to start by saying, that I usually do not review movies in a positive light. I am typically the ""warn others"" kind of person, because I know what false expectations can do to an otherwise good movie. However, I am also an advocate of voting with your wallet. And with great movies, I am glad to do a little campaign work.As for my review, I would like to begin by giving two thumbs up to Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman for creating such a great screenplay. Transformers contained enough sophisticated dialog to keep me interested in what people had to say, and an occasional one liner to keep the attention impaired laughing. But, lets face it, this was not a movie centered on banter, this was an action movie centered on CGI. In that department Dreamworks did not let us down. The action was enough to keep everyone on the edge of their seats, with some amazing live-action/CGI hybrid shots to blur the edge of classic cinematography and 3D animation.All of this, however, would not have earned a review from me. The icing on the cake, was the nostalgia that the production team included into the story. I must say that I felt like a child again, waking up to a bowl of cereal and the Saturday morning cartoons. That is not to say that the style of movie-making or character development mimicked the old cartoon; I mean I have grown up and my sensibilities have matured. Instead, the movie had just enough old school elements to spark connections in the deepest recesses of my brain that haven't fired since the mid-80's, bringing back those childhood memories. Case in point: they even got the cartoon Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) to resurrect his role as the the leader of the Autobots.I am going to digress for a second, because what is a movie review that does not address the negative. Because I could not identify anything markedly wrong with Transformers, I am going to be forced to argue nostalgic semantics. Bumble-Bee is a yellow and black (VW) Bug, there is a little irony in that, which is lost on a yellow and black Camaro. I understand that there might have been some marketing issues that made VW look bad, but it was a missed element. You can tell the original story had a Bug, so the writers can't be blamed (Who calls a 75 Camaro junk?).Once again, I am writing this not to seek a career as a writer, but to inform other movie fans, that this is a great movie, in my opinion the best so far this year. For those of you who feel jaded by a plethora of bad trilogies, go see this movie and vote with your wallet for a blockbuster. At least it will negate the votes that you may have already cast on the other movies that you were disappointed in. With that regard, I have to vote for it at the theater a couple more times.--Daniel","Jul 2, 2007",10,/10

"Sure, the SFX as everybody has stated DEFINITELY worth 10 stars. But the movie itself was totally ruined by the director or story writer whoever and deserves a huge one star. This is another movie that makes you ask ""why did he do this? why did he do that? How did this happen and so on""... When a movie makes you come up with all these ""why"" questions... it's bound to be a terrible movie. I am a huge transformer fan myself. Have toys, whole series, old movies and books of transformers since im a young kid. All these years, i expected they were going to make a transformers movie and i really looked forward to it. It was one day when i watched pirates of Caribbean 3 that i saw the preview of transformers i jumped up in mid air screaming ""oh yes!!!"". I was pumped up alright... but not when i got to the actual movie. If you're a super fan of transformers like I am, a person who would dress up as megatron with a optimus prime head to the cinemas on first viewing... trust me u'll be hugely hugely disappointed. They made the transformers look more like BIONICLE units. They couldn't really create the uniqueness of each one of the transformers AND THAT INCLUDES OPTIMUS PRIME AND MEGATRON. Fight scenes were incredibly messy too with so much goof you can pick out. OH YES THE GOOF... THERE ARE MILLIONS OF THEM YOU CAN PICK OUT. The SFX were the only thing worth watching throughout this movie. I've been doing animation myself for quite many years with Maya and zbrush for fun and i must say im quite good at it. To tell me to do a short scene with the quality of shrek or incredibles is no problems and will take about 3-4 weeks. But to tell me to do a short scene of transformers... man it'll take me 3 months at least!!! THe SFX is by far the best i've seen in a movie hands down.

"Because of how well known it is, Transformers can basically serve as an archetype of a certain kind of movie - all action, no story or characters. So when you want to describe a certain movie (say, for instance, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), you can just say: ""well, it's like Transformers"".Now don't get me wrong, I can appreciate that there is an audience for this kind of movie. Just brain off, escape from reality and enjoy the visuals, the action, a short skirt, etc.But it's not for me. For me it's actually boring, because nothing makes any sense, or no character is more than a cardboard cutout. I can like plenty of action, when it's in service of a story. Or when it's applied in self irony, like in Commando for example. Here, the movie actually seems to take itself seriously, when there's nothing in it that warrants such an attitude.Well, at least it's good to know that if you share my sentiment on this movie, you can surely skip all the sequels as well, which somehow are even more poorly received.","Jul 12, 2021",1,/10
"This is a heck of a movie!! I loved it!! I really think that even the people who never liked Transformers will love them from now on. Great special FX, really cool funny moments, what else can I say...Go and see this movie. You won't regret.OK, OK, I'm almost 30 years old and I grew up watching this cartoons, but man, this movie really rocks. If you like those kind of movies that put you nailed to your seat the entire length, you will love this one.I never thought that almost 20 years later I would return to see the Transformers, and this time in a movie. Michael Bay, I really thank you for making such a cool, breathtaking, action-full movie.Great, Great picture! Really awesome!!","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10
"this movie is one of the most awesome achievements in cinema history! awesome action sequences,good actors and a perfect director makes my all time top 20. i was not a fan of transformers before i saw this movie, i haven't seen the old animated series. i just knew that it wouldn't die out, so it had to be something special. the robot vs robot action sequences are just breathtaking, i remember thinking to my self in the theater... ""wow what the hell, how did they do that?"" i cant wait for a DVD release of this film, I'm going to watch it again and again and again. because its that kind of movie. in my opinion this is the greatest thing to hit the screen since the original matrix! and the robots and human interacting is just so believable and great made! this the kind of movie james cameron could make!This movie is a must for any movie fan!","Jun 29, 2007",10,/10
"Just like every other adolescent boy back in the mid-80's, I was a big fan of the original Transformers cartoon series. I was so much of a fan in fact, that I have since steered clear of any of the other spin-offs: from the CGI version to Beast Wars to whatever else is out there. I felt that nothing could meet my standards since the bar was set so high. Then I had proof in my 6-year old son: he has seen some of the newer versions and did not seem to liken to them the same way everyone else did to the original. One day my son told me he saw a preview for the new Transformers movie and he could instantly tell I was excited (...any reservations I had about this potential flop, I kept to myself). We rented the original movie and my son was hooked after watching it. There is no single thing I can point out that makes it so good (so I'll take the easy way out and say), it just is.So anyway, I went to the screening in DC last night and had reservations about the whole thing right up until the opening scene...and then I was blown away. The movie was everything that I had hoped for plus more. First, the visuals: anytime you have the likes of Bay, Spielberg, or DreamWorks working on a film, you're golden. Put them all together and you are left with your jaw on the floor. The sound effects were great too. When the first robot transformed (very early on in the film), it made that sound that has been ingrained in my head since the 80's and gave me chills. At that moment, practically everyone in the audience roared in unison. The only pauses in action (and there was a LOT of it) came during the comic relief. With a movie like this, one would normally expect the comedy (if any) to be mediocre but in this case it was top notch. I laughed out loud more watching this film than I have watching some comedies. For any parents out there though, just a heads up - there is a masturbation joke (I personally didn't mind it even though I was there with son...you sort of have to anticipate this sort of stuff being that it's rated PG-13). The writers really brought their A-game for this one. For me, dialogue is one of the most critical elements of a film and can easily make or break it. It wasn't the typical cheesy or dumbed down material you'd expect for a movie based on a comic book or cartoon series. The dialogue largely contributes to what makes this a solid movie as opposed to a mere special effects free for all. And there are definitely throwbacks to the original scattered all over the place, with my fav being when Optimus says ""Roll out!"" Transformers is a great movie that every kid at heart will enjoy. It extends beyond the greatness of the original series in many ways and will easily create a new generation of Transformer fans. I can't wait until it hits theaters so I can go see it again.","Jun 29, 2007",10,/10

"The expectations to the movie were not that many, which probably was a good thing. The story is well somewhat 2 dimensional and shallow. Well, it is transformers so of course how much can you expect? However, the result of trying to squeeze as much contents into the movie as possible without that much background information, actually leaves you with too many loose ends and makes the story somewhat boring. The characters are also somewhat two dimensional. Some better than others but generally not developed well enough to give them credibility and sympathy. And those army guys are mighty easy to persuade even by a teenage high school student. Even the bad guys are not given enough time to really show their evil. Actually for my taste the villains are too scattered, and give the good guys to much room to manoeuvre. A better storyline would make the movie a classic. Unfortunately to some extent I think that Michael Bay glorifies war, probably not intensionally but never the less... Raging war, for my taste, is not a glorious thing, it is a last resort. However, war scenes are pinkly sparkling in Michael Bays universe.Given all this, I still firmly endorse the film and award it the best blockbuster movie out this year. Why? Simply because when the movie finished I already couldn't wait for a sequel. The CGI probably plays a big role. It is the best CGI I have seen (ever?). The story is basically funny enough and hair raising enough (but just barely enough) to make you want more. The pirates franchise is nice and the cast is exceptional, Spider-man is able to thrill (a bit) and Mary Stuart well she is a fox. But, Although these movies are OK I wouldn't mind if there wasn't a Spiderman 4 and another pirates tale. However, given all the flaws Transformers still thrilled me and I want to see the next episode. So for me a success.It was actually interesting to hear comments from the production team that it was a low budget blockbuster of only $150mill. Only 10 years ago a $150mill production was huge. I think this development is unfortunate. Its all about the money. Well it has actually always been about the money, but these days look at the story line. What do you actually learn from Pirates, Spider-man, and Transformers. Nothing, you get entertained for a couple of hours and that is it. Pretty boring in the long run actually. I am of the generation who likes to see a story folding out. Starswars, Lord of the Rings great story lines? In the case of the Lord of the rings YES, Starwars little yes. But with Starwars there is a message. A good message, which like it or not we all can learn from if we want to. The desire to tell a great story has been replaced by the big bucks, this is a shame.Conclusion: a better storyline and more in-depth characters, and the 10 would be given. But still looking forward to the next movie.","Jul 2, 2007",8,/10

This movie is more than just robots fighting robots....the humour worked....a full on action from the start to end.......those vehicles....awesome...and MEGAN FOX...damn hot....it's a total package and everything you could have asked for in a super action movie....Even I hadn't had any clue about Transformers let alone the characters before seeing this, I was thrilled...wanting more and more from scene to scene. The only regret I had was not seeing this in a MORE GRAND cinema (it was a nearby C-grade cinema). All in all this movie will be easily digested even by non-Transformers audience.

There were a couple of times I couldn't hear a few seconds of dialogue because people in the theater were laughing so hard! The action was mind blowing.Nobody in their 20's or 30's who was a fan of the toys or TV show back in the 80's will be disappointed.

"I had low expectations when i went to this movie. I read up on Michael Bay and the kind of movies he made and was fairly convinced it would be another action packed movie with a wafer thin plot line. Too bad I was proved right about that. The plot was fairly straight forward. The bad guys want to get some powerful item to destroy their enemies and the good guys want to stop them. This movie actually has so many plot holes that you'll start wondering if you're in a strip mine... So why do i give this movie a 10 rating then? 1. It's really entertaining. The action is mixed with some comedy and viewer bonding scenes that are not annoying. 2. The actors in the movie are eye candy for everyone and they know how to act. 3. The last time me and my friends had such a kick out of a movie was some time ago. All in all it was 8,5 euro's well spent. I can recommend this movie to anybody that just wants to have some entertainment for a night, needs to see a movie that he or she doesn't need to think too much about after wards and doesn't mind overlooking some plot holes.","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10
"The original 80s Transformers cartoon series was all about shifting toys from shelves, so it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise to find that Michael Bay's prime directive for this live-action blockbuster also seems to be making money through selling stuff.Transformers has been designed to leave kids longing to reenact its bad-ass auto-bot battles via Hasbro's new range of authorised action figures, whilst giving adults the urge to load a top-of-the-range Apple iMac, Hewlett Packard laptop, an X-Box, and a crate of Mountain Dew into the back of a brand new GMC TopKick truck.But blatant product placement isn't the only thing that Bay mercilessly bombards the viewer with: he also pummels his audience into submission with an onslaught of complex CGI effects, endless loud explosions, awful dialogue, rapid fire editing, cringe-worthy moments of comedy, and lots of shouting from Anthony Anderson as an irritating gluttonous hacker. Plot development and logic are almost non-existent.Granted, for many people the sight of giant alien robots transforming into vehicles and battling each other will be entertainment enough (even I can appreciate an awesome heavy-metal smack-down), while others will welcome the sight of a sweaty Megan Fox bending over a car to fiddle with the engine, but for a movie costing $150 million, I expect more than what is essentially a visually impressive two-hour long advert for kids' toys and luxury goods.","Jun 6, 2012",5,/10
"I'll tell you now, no i did not grow up worshiping transformers and i really had no expectations for this movie other than the fact that it looked cool. What i do have to say about this movie is that it is not just a movie but an experience! This is the most kick ass action/sci-fi whatever kinda movie you wanna call it i've ever scene. You CANNOT be disappointed there is nothing to be disappointed about when seeing this movie. Yes, some of the dialogue is a little cheesy but you can't even think about it because the rest of the movie is just so freaking good and intense. You feel like you want to jump out of your seat and be in the scene it's so intense! It's also really funny. Even though like i said some of the dialogue is cheesy a lot of it is really funny. We were rolling around in our seats with some of the stuff that is said but it doesn't over do it if that's what you're thinking. This movie is sooo definitely worth it. My friend is a die hard fan he's been talking about this movie since it first got mentioned, and he was not disappointed. he was blown away (a true devoted fan he is). This is something you're gonna wanna see over and over in theaters. The intensity of this movie is overwhelming and i was so wired when i left the theater i can't even sleep cause all i can think about is all the battle scenes and how bad ass everything is. Oh my god!!!! I loved it. The autobots are insanely diesel looking. It's so real when they change I just i dunno i can't even explain it but you HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!! and you have to see it theaters, it won't be the same if you don't see it on a big screen with the surround sound.all right well guess that's it for this time so go see it and enjoy :)","Jun 30, 2007",9,/10

They brought CGI to the next level with this, it was spectacular.I'm not sure how true to the series the story was. I did have the toys as a kid but I didn't really follow the cartoon series. The only thing that would have made this movie even better was if the characters were the vehicles they should have been instead of GM vehicles. They really should have left Bumblebee as a Beetle.Overall, I thought this movie was great. Not in a long time have people applauded at the end of the movie. I heard there are 2 more movies following this one. Hopefully they'll be just as good, if not better.","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10
"I love good action movies. They are a great way to relax and forget reality for a while. But this movie just made me cringe. I felt embarrassed for the actors who had to utter those unbelievably stupid lines and to act out that absurd plot line with a straight face. This plot line can be summed up in one sentence: a bunch of morons hectically running around, shouting inane things and acting in incomprehensible ways. The special effects are great but one-dimensional and repetitive and lose their appeal very quickly. After 10 minutes or so they are just boring and grate on the nerves. Noise and movement and colorful explosions are not enough to sustain a film, especially if the action sequences consist entirely of endless variations of the same theme: bulky robots fighting each other and crushing things.The only redeeming feature of this film is the beauty (not acting capability) of Megan Fox.

Surprisingly, I went to the movies twice so far to bring friends and family to watch this movie. It is extremely well made, from the story, music score, special effects, camera angles, etc. I cannot say enough and will agree that there is a great chance this movie will have many sequels to follow. I would recommend this to everyone and given the amount of violence in today's public TV networks, might as well bring the kids. You will truly enjoy this production.","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10

"This is a pretty decent action flick. Yes, it's mindless exhilaration, but what more do you honestly expect from a movie based on toys? Anyone looking for some in-depth, character-driven drama is probably going to be out of luck. That is not to say the humans in this film are totally worthless. Quite the opposite, actually. The two leads (Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky and Megan Fox as Mikaela) help ground the film (as much as a film about robots disguised as vehicles can be). I didn't find the two of them the least bit annoying (which is always the danger with these sorts of movies, where no one's really interested in the human characters, they're more interested in the big CGI creations). Thank goodness the film has these two actors. I thought they did an admirable job of keeping us interested in the storyline when the focus was shifted from the Transformers back to the humans.The first half of the film has quite a delightful sense of humour to it. Sam is a decent guy. Not in that irritating goodie-two-shoes kind of way, just a regular everyday type who people can relate to. He's a believable character and doesn't camp it up. Mikaela is not the usual run-of-the-mill damsel-in-distress either. Like the robots in this film, there's more to Mikaela than meets the eye. Her character proves to be quite resourceful and not just a pretty face. If these two lead characters had been a failure and miscast, the movie would have been extremely dismal. Thankfully, that is not the case. A lot of the humour in the film comes from Sam and his beaten up Camaro (Bumblebee), that he purchases as his first car. To go into detail about all the humorous bits would ruin the fun, but suffice to say, there's no shortage of comical moments (fully *intentional*, of course) in this film. Even Sam's parents get a few laughs.The other humans? Eh, you could take them or leave them. They're not cardboard cutouts or anything, but neither are they as well-developed as the two main characters. The Transformers themselves tend to vary in how effective they are on screen. The evil Decepticons don't get much to say/do. Though they *do* get to trash lots of stuff (which, I guess, is what Decepticons do best). Their leader, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving - not that you can really tell it's him) isn't in the film as much as some might have hoped. The Autobots, however, get a good deal more screen time. They're far more developed and actually have personalities. The most memorable, of course, being their leader (Optimus Prime - voiced by Peter Cullen). Though there have been considerable alterations made to the appearances of the Transformers, they still look good on film. You certainly believe that vehicles can turn into giant robots, when watching this movie. The CGI is indeed impressive. It's just too bad that the editing in the action scenes is all over the place, making it extremely hard to tell what's going on.At first glance, this film appears to be nothing more than a fun roller-coaster ride of action and robots blowing stuff up. There's actually a bit more to it than that, if you look closely, and this is the reason why I found the film to be successful.","Jun 27, 2007",8,/10

"Congratulations to Michael Bay for transporting us into a world of fantastic fantasy. TRANSFORMERS is the best summer movie since 1993's Jurassic Park. I really enjopyed it.Here are my favourite scenes from the movie : - The opening attack scene from Blackout. WOW! - Sam running for his life from ""Satan's Camaro!"". - Sam's encounter with Barricade. Barricade's voice was scary! - The arrival of Prime, Ironhide, Ratchet and Jazz to earth. The music was so involving. - The Autobots at Sam's house. Look at how Prime hides himself to avoid Ron (Sam's father). - Bumblebee taken down and captured. It made me cry. - The army escorted Bumblebee to Mission City and met Prime & gang along the way. - The battle between Autobots and Decepticons in the city. Destruction everywhere! Cool! - Starscream chases, converts and smashes a few Raptor jets.Having to watch most of my favorite characters such as Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, Starscream, Jazz, Frenzy (not as a cassette), Ironhide and Ratchet come to life gave me the goosebumps.Characters such as Blackout, Scorponok, Barricade, Devastator and Bonecrusher instead of Soundwave, Ravage, Laserbeak, etc. are not a disappointment at all. They really fit the purpose of bringing destruction... Yes, there should be more characters from the animation but come on, open your mind and take it as a new story...Besides, what can a cassette player do anyway?... Level a car?","Jun 30, 2007",9,/10
"A high school student, Sam (played by Shia LeBeouf), buys his first car. The car turns out to be a Transformer, a robot that can transform itself into many different things (but mostly vehicles). The car is a benevolent Transformer but there are evil ones out there...The fact that this is directed by Michael Bay should tip you off that this is going to filled with many spectacular explosions, and nothing else. Spectacularly bad, just like Pearl Harbour: weak plot, laughable dialogue, wooden acting. Clearly made for kids. Ironically, it is 2.5 hours long, making it a bit too long for kids' concentration spans. Mr Bay clearly has not even adhered to the first rule of movie making - if you can't make a good movie, make a short movie.","Mar 11, 2016",2,/10
"First off I never write reviews, but after a friend (thanks Kevin!) managed to snag pre-screening tickets for myself and a few close friends, I feel I must.Transformers was INCREDIBLE. The BEST and MOST ENJOYABLE movie I have paid to see since Batman Begins in summer 05. I have always been a Transformers fan, never a rabid die-hard one, but I watched the original series and had the toys etc. People are very critical of Michael Bay calling this film ""Bayformers"" and accusing him of ruining their childhoods etc. That is bogus, if anything this movie made me re-live those great moments of yesteryear. He throws in plenty of references to the G1 cartoons and pays homage to the original series which die hard fans are sure to pick up on and enjoy.CGI: the best I have ever seen. The Transformers have plenty of screen time with the real live actors and it was amazing how photo realistic they all looked.ACTION: non stop never ending. From 10 minutes in to the rolling credits. Explosions, robots, military, guns, BOOM BOOM BOOM FANTASTIC!STORY: surprisingly good. Everyone on these boards knows what to expect. Autobots are good and must stop the Deceptacons from finding the All Spark. The pacing of the plot is done very well and there are never dull/boring moments.COMEDY: actually really funny. Shia did a great job, and Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson were great in their minor roles.SUMMARY: This visual feast will live up to the hype and I can't recommend it enough.

The projectionist screwed up and it took 20 minutes before the film started from when it should have but it was so worth the wait. The story line holds very well to the original animated movie even down to some of the lines. ""One shall stand one shall fall"" as Optimus and Megatron prepare to fight for anyone that has seen the original animated movie that is enough to send a chill down your spine.

Great acting, a surprisingly funny script and flawless effects had the whole movie theater in awe for the whole of the film.I also think they really aimed the film at the average teenage boy who was a loyal fan of the cartoon. Although if you've never seen the original don't worry it explains everything.Easily Micheal Bays best, but one has to wonder how much influence Spielberg had on the film. I was also happy to see only two or so cringe moments in the whole film other than that the movie is excellent. Much better than any of this summers previous blockbusters, and leaves room for a sequel (maybe),(hopefuly)...Overall I found it amazing and recommend it to all, but mainly the teenage boys (stoners classic)p.s Megan fox is a mega fox.10/10.","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10

Although I cant figure out why they had a boom box but it wasn't Sound Wave!!! If they truly are going to turn this into a trilogy then leaving some of the characters out of the first movie makes sense. I'm also glad that although there was a love story, it wasn't the main story line and didn't take over the film. And at least they kept the morphing sound.

This movie has taken the visual graphics that we thought were possible, to an entirely new level!! No wonder this movie had taken so long to make, these guys covered every inch imaginable for the transformations of these characters and they way the presented themselves on the screen. Great work!The trick to a movie like this was to develop a storyline that was continuously moving and was never in a state of submission. And that is exactly what the writers did, there was not a single dull moment that i could find in this movie! The humour was great, nothing stale and nothing over the top, great humour that we could all relate to!And finally the acting, great job done by Shia as Sam, and Megan Fox alone adds a star to the rating (WHAT A BODY!!) It was great having actors in there that weren't overly famous, just good ones who do not draw attention to themselves in the real world.In summary i think this movie is a step-up from the rest, it basically blows you away and makes you think ""Wow, there are actually some amazing movies being made!""I can guarantee that whether you're a die hard fan or not, you'll come out feeling very satisfied!","Jul 1, 2007",10,/10
"Oh, Transformers...what can I say? I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't make myself. Here's why, there was very little character development of the autobots (except for Bumblebee) so I didn't really care what happened to them, also this movie should have either been PG or R. It lost so much of it's potential trying to please everyone. Very few movies can be for both kids and adults and still be excellent. I had a few other problems with the movie as well, like could they make the girl more TAN or SLUTY looking? And her character is kinda unbelievable. Also I found that the movie promoted some racial stereotypes. There were some bright spots in the movie...the back story on Sam's family was cool (although a bit underdeveloped), the actor who plays Sam is very charismatic, and of course the special effects were cool.","Oct 15, 2007",4,/10

Three hours of a movie in which nothing happens much except the I give you him so you can give me my father who gives me a boat that you want and that he gives for....who understood the plot raise their hands, I didn't. at the end who was on whom's side? And yet the summer filled with so many pathetic sequels, prequels , newquels and so on, finally delivered a worthy baby: Transformers. This must be THE ultimate action movie ever made, hands down! And definitely a must-see!!!! I mean you've got so much action you can't even chew your popcorn properly for the sake of losing a scene, you've got top notch visuals, incredible action sequences, along side some quite funny dialogs and last but not least Megan Fox, who's really freakin hot.This must be the best movie seen this year yet, and it's not likely to see any better visuals in any following releases, thus I recommend you all to go out there, stay in line or whatever, get yourselves a ticket and enjoy one hell of a ride!

"I was an unabashed fan of the Transformers in my youth during the 1980s. It competed with two other major toy franchises (G.I. Joe and Masters of the Universe) for my attention and my parent's money, especially at Christmas time. I watched the animated series, went to see the animated movie twice in the theater in the summer of '86 and read the comic books. Of course, as time passed, other things consumed my interest over the Transformers, but I still feel a strong pull of nostalgia for that franchise. Now, two decades after the peak of the Transformers phenomenon, director Michael Bay has brought the Transformers back to the big screen with a live-action adaptation of the material, and as much as my nostalgia is piqued by this film, upon watching the final product, instead of mining gold, Bay, along with screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have managed to only produce a ho-hum affair, living up to the Shakespeare line: Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.Transformers opens in Iraq, where a helicopter lands at a military base and proceeds to lay waste to it, transforming into a giant robot, and attempting to hack the computers. The narrative then moves to America, where high school student Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is purchasing his first car, which turns out to be a Camaro that is eerily insistent that Sam buy it. Upon getting it home, it drives itself off and Sam chases it, meeting up with a classmate, Mikaela (Megan Fox), and they find themselves caught in the middle of an interstellar war between two groups of sentient robots from another planet, the good ones named Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) , the evil ones Decepticons, led by Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving), who have the ability of camouflaging themselves as vehicles and electronic equipment. Both factions are in search of a cube named the All Spark that can bring life to otherwise inanimate technological objects; the Autobots want to destroy it before the Decepticons can use it to build an army to conquer the Universe (yes, a character actually specifies Universe in one scene).Transformers has a number of problems, but it's two principal ones are a padded running length and a lack of any genuine excitement. Much like the Pirates of the Caribbean films, Transformers is too long for the material it has to work with. After the opening battle scene in Iraq, the film runs a good hour plus before anything else of tremendous interest occurs. Most of the scenes in the middle feature Sam getting his car, hitting on Mikaela, and a subplot involving young analysts at the Pentagon trying to decipher a signal detected during the Qatar attack that will hopefully lead to an answer as to what happened at the base. There is some light comedy sprinkled into these scenes, but nothing compelling that hasn't been done before and you find yourself wondering when the giant robots the trailers promised are going to show up.Finally, the Transformers make an appearance, at which point the film showcases its most significant asset, the rather impressive computer animation of the Transformers. While the quality does vacillate a bit (many of the close-ups of the Transformers look fairly obviously computer generated), the majority of the imagery is well integrated into the real material for a reasonably seamless result. The problem, however, is that the Transformers are not developed at all as characters. Optimus Prime has a significant amount of dialogue, and Bumblebee, the Camaro, has some draw to him, but for the most part, they are just eye-candy. The Decepticons fare much worse, with no sense of menace, no danger to them, failing to cause us to hate them as villains. We don't care about the Transformers or their plight and aside from the fact that I played with them as a child, and therefore recognize the names, you can barely tell one apart from the other in most scenes.The culmination of all this is that none of the action sequences at the end of the film have any weight to them. There is pyrotechnics galore, to be sure, but none of it matters a bit. It is just scene after scene of explosions and generic, non-descript robots tussling with each other for no real purpose. We don't care if one wins or the other loses and we don't care about the majority of the human characters caught in the middle either (I couldn't give you the names of the characters portrayed by Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson from memory even if I tried). A few shots here and there have some kinetic kick to them, but that is about it.Shia LeBeouf carries the role of Sam fairly well and should prove to have a decent career ahead of him, but he can't manage to elevate the role above the generic part that has been created. Megan Fox is certainly very attractive, but her character has even less development than Sam and proves to just be one more visual attraction in a film swirling with pretty images. Jon Voight is mostly here to collect a paycheck, Anthony Anderson shows up for a few scenes to do a variation on his usual schtick (which is funny at times), and then there is John Turturro. Portraying a government agent, Turturro must have been told he was starring in a parody film and turns in an over the top performance that you can't even begin to take seriously. He is amusing, but it is just one more hit at giving any depth to this film.While some may disagree, I believe there is the possibility of a good film somewhere in this material, but Michael Bay was unable to recognize it and build one. Instead, we are left with this loud, overlong, underwhelming film that is definitely not more than meets the eye.","Jul 9, 2007",4,/10
"If you're not carried away by this movie you never will... Fantastic effects, high pace actions scenes and wicked music!...and believe it or not, it actually have a good story...It may have some errors from the original series, but the movie is so well made it does not matter. Even my wife liked it, and she does not normally like Sci-Fi. It has passion, moral and all the good things a movie like this should have.Actors are good and convincing which is normally very hard with so much CGI. The lines are not too cheesy either.Just sit back and enjoy... I dare you not to smile....","Jun 29, 2007",10,/10
"I tried not to look up too much on the Transformers movie beforehand, because I wanted a fresh experience when I did see it. These days it's possible to find out pretty much everything about any big movie before you even see it, and I didn't want that to happen to me. I also hadn't seen any of Michael Bay's movies previous to this, so I didn't come in with any preconceived notions about the director. As someone who was a kid back in the G1 days, I haven't really kept up with any of the current story lines since Beast Wars. There are also some scenes interspersed with the credits, so it pays to not leave as soon as the credits roll.The good: The special effects were spectacular, as expected. You really got a sense of how *big* and awesome the TFs are. There are some funny moments to break the tension, including some that had the entire theater in stitches. The main characters got a lot of characterization and there was a good human angle on the story. Prime's voice is done by his original VA, Peter Cullen (who sounds older than he did in the G1 cartoon, but I suppose that's because he IS older). There are also some memorable quotes pulled from the first TF movie.The bad: While I understand the need for updated vehicle modes, I wish that the TF's robot forms looked closer to their G1 counterpart's, even if it was just in the facial features. If you're familiar with the Alternators toy line, they're a good example of how IMHO the TFs *should* look in robot mode. Some of the TFs got very few lines, and thus not much in the way of characterization. I would have preferred there to be some interaction scenes between the Decepticons, to show their personalities better. The movie didn't use the 'transforming sound', it's just kind of a mechanical clanking and whirring.The neutral: The story deviates from the classic G1 storyline on how the TFs came to Earth. It's still 'giant alien robots come to Earth' but the details are different. Prime has the face shield, but it's retractable and he spends most of his screen time with it off. It's kind of odd for me to see him with a mouth, but then again, this isn't the first time he's had one. Some of the characters do get killed, but due to their lack of characterization, it's hard for me to feel for them like I did when characters died in the first TF movie. There is some swearing and sexually themed jokes, so I don't know about taking really young kids to see it if you're hung up on stuff like that, but teens should be fine.Overall, this movie is full of win and well worth the $9 it cost me to see it.","Jul 5, 2007",8,/10
"Posted by MrCarpalTunnelJuly 4th, 2007 Now don't get me wrong; I remember the Transformers. I also remember the Go-Bots and Weebulls. However I just didn't think I would ever type these words: This Movie Was Awesome. In a Summer filled with sequels and unoriginal plots, I wasn't expecting much from this outing about kids toys on the big-screen. Michael Bay has made me rethink my first-impression pejudice.The film is right up there with Independence Day. You remember the Will Smith sci-fi spectacular? Both films are equally as entertaining and pretty similar. Both are about the impending doom coming to Earth. Both have the Government hiding a secret. Both took a mediocre star (Will Smith) and changed the way we perceive him (Shia LaBeouf). Without ruining any of the film; it's pretty much your Doomsday Vehicle for Summer. With one exception: It's FUN! The Cars, the Bots, and the sets are amazing to look at. Each left me wanting another huge chase or battle to erupt. The scale at which the film takes place is just worth the ticket price.If you are into the Transformers (kids or adults) I think you will feel that this movie has treated the characters on a grand-scale. However if your looking for true action Die Hard 4 is still showing. However I have to say this: This movie was far more entertaining and Optimus Prime never told Megatron ""Yippie Kay Yae Mother!""If you see one Transformer film this Summer make sure this is it. However I hear John Travolta gives the Auto-Bots a run for their money.www.xblradio.comDon't miss our upcoming KID PIX on Transformers the Game for the 360!","Jul 4, 2007",8,/10

Yesterday I went and watched a movie called Transformers at Parramatta cinemas Greater Union. Transformers was an awesome and more of a action and a more of a broader movie to my perspectives of the movie. As I watched the movie I thought to myself what an astonishing and an amazing movie it was. There were many scenes that were extraordinary that happened unexpectedly. The plot was not bad but the characters were funny(some) The setting was also great matching the action in the movie.In my own opinion if your wanting to watch a movie with great action to watch in cinemas like reading cinemas(if its available there) than i think you came to watch the right movie thats going to overtake your thoughts about other movies you've liked. Watch it! You'll like it!,"Jul 6, 2007",9,/10
"I'll keep this short.I was a huge fan of the original Transformers. When I heard that a live-action film was being made I couldn't wait to see it!First of all, the Transformer robots in this film are not Transformers. Apart from the colour they look nothing like the originals. This was so incredible to me. They were so far off the mark. The makers of the Citroen ad Transformer nailed it. That robot looked more like a Transformer that the ones in the film.Well done Citroen!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4ckJFNkra8","Dec 14, 2007",3,/10
"SYNOPSIS: Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeouf) and his crush, Mikaela (Megan Fox) find themselves caught in the midst of a security crisis involving shape shifting androids. Based on the popular toy line. PROS: The biggest pro of this movie are the Transformers themselves. Designed by ILM, these robots go beyond the typical sci-fi cinema eye-candy and become convincing creations that are up there with 'Pirates' Davy Jones as some of the best CGI creations ever to grace the silver screen. Shia Labeouf also does an excellent job. The whole movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes it work. Also great is the fact that this film never takes itself too seriously. Director Michael Bay and Co. understand the humor in the story, and thus produce some great laughs. CONS: My biggest problem with this movie is the fact that it was shot in a gritty, hand-held-camera style that doesn;t fit the story. Instead of adding extra intensity, it just make the viewer dizzy. Also, there are a few moments of Michael Bay excess, some unintentionally hilarious lines, and some annoyingly blatant product placements. Overall, Transformers is a big, brassy blast that is best viewed on the big screen.","Jul 6, 2007",8,/10
"I saw this movie on DVD yesterday, and oh my god!!! What a fabulous movie...The visual effects are the most incredible that i've ever seen, I think he deserves an Oscar on the visual effects category. The sound was absolutely amazing too. Performances as also great, Shia has something in his expression that makes me laugh. The script was also great, but a little bit confuse. The voice of the robots was strange. But the best part of the movie was definitely visual effects. I think this movie will be the mark of a big era of the visual effects. I recommend everyone to go see this movie.(Sorry about my English, I'm Portuguese)...","Dec 8, 2007",10,/10
"I have seen a lot of cartoons growing up like Batman. Transformers though is one I never watched. I thought I might not like this movie as much because I didn't know anything about Transformers. I ended up watching it anyways and man I must say I LOVED IT. I was very happy with this movie. This film was made almost perfectly in every way. The movie did a great job at explaining the story of Transformers. It's great for both fans and non fans. The beginning was awesome with Blackout taking over the base. All the way to the end with the final showdown. The special effects are incredible. The way the autobots and decepticons transform is my favorite part of the movie. The characters are done very well. I liked the movie so much I watched it at least 2 mores time again. I immediately got into transformers after this movie. There are very few flaws I saw in this movie. I think the editing could have been a tad better, it would have been nice to see more dialogue between Megatron and Starscream, the idea of 2 young kids working at the Pentagon just seems funny, and small other little bits of stuff. This still doesn't stop me from giving Transformers a 10. I am surprised that there are actually people that bash the film. In my opinion it's one of the best comic movies ever made with Batman Begins. I would recommend this movie to anyone.","Nov 8, 2007",10,/10

"I remember those days when I was a kid and used to come home from school and head straight into the TV room for the 4pm cartoon - The Transformers.This movie really brought back my childhood. Though plot was quite predictable (we all know bad aliens always die!!), it was nevertheless, still enjoyable. I guess the special effects and those big robots made this movie really outstanding, but obviously Optimus Prime and his 'cool' crew stole the show.Megan Fox was HOT as ever. Guess she finally came out of the closet. Shia's performance was great but somehow I didn't see the chemistry between him and Megan. Who knows? Maybe there's more than meets the eye! Anyways, Transformers is one of the best 2007 movies I've seen and this is one movie I won't mind watching again...","Jul 7, 2007",9,/10
"I'm not a very big Transformers fan: I never owned the toys or watched the show. I did, however, watch the original movie. I greatly prefer campy commercial to this bloated commercial, here is why:Sam & Company- As with that terrible GODZILLA remake, the producers apparently decided ""Well, people came to see Transformers, but we have to tag this half-assed 'nerd fantasy romance' onto it and spend 80% of the movie on the humans."" That would be well and good, if the humans were in some way unique or interesting. Instead, we basically get the same crappy types we've seen again and again (young fresh types overcoming authority figures, clueless parents ((think the parents in a very toned down version of American Pie)) and you have the human element. Plus a ""soldier with a young daughter back home"" subplot that pisses me off in the way only Michael Bay's lowest common denominator tricks can. Autobots: I know I was supposed to be blown away by the fact Peter Cullen from the cartoon is the voice of Optimus Prime (God knows why that would impress a nonfan: his acting is not good) Well, I would have been fine having freakin' Steve Carell voice the character if he his dialogue was good at all. Instead, he spends half of his lines telling us how great Sam the lovable nerd is, and at least a quarter spouting the dumbest howlers I have ever heard. The other autobots got so little screen time that literally an hour after watching it, I only remember that there is a joke about one of them wizzing on a human as a joke. Decepticons: Incredibly, they are even less developed than the autobots, barely getting to destroy anything or properly present themselves as a menace. I mean, there's EIGHT of them, and we see humans are able to damage them early on. You honestly get the impression the humans could defeat them without the autobots, even if they do use ""the cube"" (An idea so patently stupid it makes the cartoon seem like FIGHT CLUB) People complain about how indistinguishable the cartoon characters are? These guys are so close in design that Starscream and Megatron could stand up next to each other in a lineup and you couldn't tell them apart. John Turtorro: He is in it, he has lines, and a lot of them. In short, only watch this movie if you have no imagination. Everyone else is advised to just shut their eyes, and imagine what this movie would be like. You will probably dream up something much more watchable, and it will be all yours.","Jul 6, 2007",5,/10
"That about sums up Transformers. What you get here is about 45 mins of totally awesome giant-robot-mashing a$$ kickery interspersed with 95 minutes of Stupid. I don't know what I was expecting though I mean Transformers is for kids right? OK yeah it was but most of those kids that watched the show when it was in it's heyday have now grown up. Well Transformers hasn't although I don't know if thats a good thing or a bad thing but it will possibly mean that people that remember the source material fondly will look at parts of this movie and think, man is this what passed for cool when I was a kid?It often feels like Michael Bay has blended two movies together here, you get the stock action movie, with tense war room situations, stereotypical characters, big explosions, cliché dialog etc. And then you get the actual bits with the Transformers in which, while epic in spectacle are clearly aimed at kids with dialog and exposition worse than the original series. Some of it will make you cringe it's so corny.The opening of the movie where one of the decepticons assaults an army base in the desert is really well done and when you see the first robot transformation your jaw will hit the floor. We're talking thousands of moving parts with panels twisting, hydraulics working, sections coming apart and coming together. The FX are freaking awesome. And thats what carries the movie and keeps you watching cos I'll tell you what, it ain't the story. There's isn't one. Thats right but what did you expect.Transformers the live action movie was always going to be as successful as the FX and the action and thats what we get here by the bucketload. You can see most of the budget up on the screen. There are a few nitpicky things that fans will probably complain about. Bumble Bee isn't a beetle car since the film makers couldn't get permission to use the car for the movie. Optimus Prime has no faceplate for most of the movie. I didn't think that one was too bad myself but I've heard fanboys really whine and complain about it.Shia Labeouf puts in the only decent performance of note throughout the whole movie which is the only reason to get behind his one dimensional character. I suppose John Tuturo is alright in his small role.When the robots aren't on screen doing their thing we're treated to derivative ""seen it all before"" filler crap that aims for clichés and cheap gags to link the awesome bits together. None of them are really so lame as to spoil the movie but it's really totally by the numbers and surely the writers could have come up with something a bit better but they probably figured they could get away with it because with the subject matter they were onto a surefire license to print money.In the end it's a movie you'll see and most will probably really enjoy it for what it is. A shallow but epic action movie with giant robots galore breaking stuff, destroying buildings and looking really good while doing it. A popcorn movie. Thats about all you get and for a lot of people thats probably enough.Technology in movies now is getting to the point where epic spectacle and action is fast becoming the norm and if we don't get some story with our eye candy then things could be in danger of becoming very bland indeed.","Jul 6, 2007",8,/10
"Seriously, it's really great. Even if you don't know anything about Transformers (like me) you're still going to enjoy it a lot. The story, the humor, and the action were just AWESOME. You might expect them to use the Transformers a lot but they actually focus most on the human characters. In fact, very few of the Transformers are developed in the course of the story. This isn't actually a flaw because I think its better like this for those who aren't fans of Transformers (like me). The only problem I actually saw was that some of the Transformers look similar and you might have trouble recognizing them. This definitely deserves a 10.","Nov 28, 2007",10,/10

"The biggest movie of the summer? I hope not. I was a huge Transformers fan as a kid in the 80s and was looking forward to this film, unfortunately it doesn't deliver at all. There is no plot, no script, very bad dialogue and poor humour throughout.A little more effort on the script and this could have been the movie of 2007. I think they blew the entire budget on special effects.Saving graces are the special effects and the action scenes. If you want to see Transformers done properly buy the 1980s animated movie. Parents be wary, although this film has a low rating there's no way i'd let kids under 12 see this film, it contains a largely adult themes.I went to see the film with 4 friends, they all enjoyed the film a lot and reading the other comments and the IMDb rating it seems i'm in the minority on this but I really think this film failed to deliver. Lets hope like with Star Wars the sequel turns out better....","Aug 9, 2007",5,/10
"Well I have just watched the Transformers movie in the Republic of Korea and I was very impressed with the look and feel of the movie. The action is plentiful and spectacular, the computer-generated robots are superbly detailed as they transform and the actors' performances are great. The story is easy to follow, the pacing is good and two-hours fly by. A well deserved 8/10.BUT...this movie scores a 2/10 for honesty, fairness and integrity. It's very sad that so many children, with impressionable young minds, will watch this movie and believe it's propaganda. The movie, which is masquerading as a 'summer blockbuster', stinks of neo-corporate American and neo-conservative ideology ..!! I left the movie theater feeling like I had just watched a recruiting commercial for the US armed services, American family values and for wanton consumerism. It's quite understandable - that parts of the movie must be pro-military - because many scenes involve equipment (such as planes, tanks etc) and personnel. They would never have been done to such a high calibre, I suspect, without the assistance of the US Defence Department. But it's the overt use of current events together with images of the military might of America which leaves a bad taste in the mouth. For instance, before the Tranformers are first revealed, China, North Korea and Iran are all mentioned as the potential threat! The audience is then treated to scenes of American Battle fleets with aircraft carriers and attack ships steaming across the oceans. There is no diplomacy or meetings, the movie is showing us that America will always use 'might-is-right' action when a threat is detected. Which to the average low-expectation Homo Sapiens will be just another reinforcement of America's homeland security operations. Likewise the clever use of vehicles and electrical appliances just repeatedly reinforces a glorious view of machines and technology. I wonder how many audiences members want a cell phone, car or computer like those seen in the movie! At one point, a vehicle produces a vast amount of dirty smoke, which just drifts off into atmosphere!! As my friend noted, if the bad Transformers wanted to take over the world, they shouldn't have bothered fighting, they should have just driven around in their vehicles forms for the next few years. Bye bye Ozone!! Bye Bye humans!! I would go on, but I am bored, so to conclude....If you believe that American foreign policy, American military deployment and America's attitude towards the environment are correct, then Transformers is an ideologically sound movie. But if you believe the world could be better without the current American administration then this movie will grate.Particularly the home-spun ending!!","Jul 18, 2007",8,/10

"Maybe I was expecting too much, having grown up with Transformers and then they vanished only to reappear in the 90's. I'll keep my comments brief.1 - The plot is good, keeping with the current story ideas/plots of the cartoons. It doesn't pull the story from the 'toon, if it I had would have been severely disappointed but it take the idea of these modern day Transformers and expands that into a movie. For that, I can only give it an ""A"".2 - I found the special effects (particularly the transformation) to be way too much. There is only one scene that really shows these guys transforming. Everything else is a blur of metal and gizmos that take away from the picture. Because of this, I have to give the movie and overall ""B+""","Jul 7, 2007",8,/10
"As many fans who have posted here, I was a huge Transformers as a kid...I had many of the toys, saw the 80s animated film in the theater and have followed the more recent animated ""Energon"" series.While I was disappointed by the fact that there were only a handful of Transformers and some of the character models (I've never preferred Prime with a moving mouth), this movie exceeded my expectations. And mind you, leading up to this film, those expectations were very low. First off, these types of old toy/comic/cartoon revival films rarely pan out well (remember Masters of the Universe? What a rape job...I would KILL for an updated, good adaption of He-Man!); the other detriment is that it's a Michael Bay film, whom I've never been impressed with. But he surprised me here.I think Spielberg's role helped out in droves here to temper Bay's action-lust style. Granted, the action doesn't stop for the entire film, but what downtime does exist is filled with good (and much unexpected) humor without degrading the ""coolness"" of the Transformers. It even had decent touches of drama and sentiment. In essence, the plot was true to the original series - which was never overwhelmingly original - but works fine for the sake of this film. In fact, there was some good layering to the background story and how the original discovery of the Transformer's existence shaped modern technology. Of course there are some over the top elements to the plot, but how could anyone expect any different? If you enjoy what you're seeing, let it roll and that was true for me.I think most people (especially casual fans or non-fans) will walk away from this at least appreciating it as a great action film with spellbinding effects. No sense in giving detail here, but this is a big screen film for sure. Despite how long it takes to actually see the majority of the Transformers, there is good suspense and buildup to their unveiling (especially Prime). And after they have all arrived, we see PLENTY of them.Despite the film's length, it never seemed to drag on. I'd love to see future installments take us to different planets and have Megatron be revived as Galvatron. A power struggle between Megatron/Galavtron and Starscream would also be a nice twist and ode to the old premise of the Transformers' chemistry with one another. And hey wait, add Unicron to the wish list! What's more threatening than a Transformer that devours planets?I think this is a great film for any action/effects fan, and while I'm sure some Transformers fans might disapprove of this chapter, it's a must-see just to know either way. I for one, was satisfied.What's next for Hollywood and Hasbro? My guess would be ""Yo Joe!""","Jul 6, 2007",8,/10
"OK, I love the movie, outright. The only thing is Michael Bay, maybe they could have gotten someone else to direct that was better. He directs in the way that he directed Armageddon, and Pearl Harbor. The close up's of the transformations made it a little hard to tell how they were transforming. And the lack of Starcream being more involved in the movie was a let down; however minor. I wish they would have used the the transformations sounds from the cartoon more in this movie; although, I did hear it every once and a while. It would have been great to hear Optimus transform with the original sound from the cartoon. I love that they brought Peter Weller back from the cartoon series to do Optimus Primes voice, anything else would have been a let down, and would have brought the score way down. Other than that, good acting, great special effects. The only question is to ask. Who is going to be the transformers on the sequel? I'm thinking devastator (Constructicons). Everyone knows Soundwave will be in the next one, and starscream. And Kup will be too, you gotta have an old timer to goto when you don't have the answer, that's the way it works in real life. Oh yeah, far fetched, but maybe not, Unicron. But he may be in the third one. And the director may go as far to put a triple changer in for the first time. Anyways, enjoy the movie, it's a must to go watch on the big screen. NOTE: They should have had some of the 80's music from the original movie in this movie.","Jul 4, 2007",9,/10
"I'm not going to completely degrade this movie with giving out a 1, but it sure doesn't deserve anything more than a 4. I'm not particularly a fan of Michael Bay, as I've seen probably most of his movies, simply because they are unavoidable. Michael Bay once again leads a giant circus to the worldwide cinema's.I have seen Transformers a lot when I was young and I was hoping for once that Michael would not make complete circus out of a concept. I was hopeful when going to the cinema but after half an hour I was getting annoyed with the dialogue, the overly cheesy jokes and the total lack of depth of the concept.It instantly made me feel I was in a circus watching clowns dressed up like Transformer character creating slapstick humor. The thing with humor is, it messes up an ambiance completely. On the other hand, there was no ambiance of ""feel"" of the Transformer movies at all, so the jokes didn't hurt it. I do feel the old concept has been ""whored"" by Mr. Bay.The CGI was breathtaking, I have to say that. The action was very, very awesome to see. I felt so sorry for the people that created the action scenes, because the awesomeness it created was completely destroyed afterwards by one of the cheesy jokes. I am really tired of ""the usual movie clown screaming and acting as if he's on speed"".A concept ruined. Do not watch this movie if you're a transformer fan. Unless you like a persiflage version of the Transformers.Thank you Guy Chapman for being so spot on with your review about the movie.","Jul 13, 2007",4,/10

"I can just imagine all these over paid, self important movie producer people sitting around a table 'musing' about what should be in the film 'Transformers' that would make it a 'box office hit'...That in itself would probably make a great comedy. Or maybe they knew it was an assured hit so they just put a load of monkeys in a room with a type writer... The people behind this film had no regard for the depth of the original Transformers story and were seemingly ignorant of it. This film is only worthy of being called Transformers in the most shallow sense.You really know a movie is bad when a TV advert for a fairly bland looking family hatchback car makes a more convincing looking transformer than the movie did...One that you could actually tell it was a car, after it transformed. AND, even though the 'transformer' in the advert was just a plain old family car it still managed to come off as way cooler and much more authentic... Maybe the team behind that advert should have been given the job of doing the CGI on this film?It seems that you can slap a big name on a movie like 'Transformers' or 'Aliens vs Predator' or 'Star wars' but then make it so bad that it does a good job of ruining the credibility of the franchise which was originally great...But it is OK, the people behind it have made so much money from basically screwing the movie going public that they don't care what you think...SighThe movie industry wonders why sales are down and people don't go to the cinema any more...Are they really that blind? I can fully understand why people would download a pirated version of piece of cr*p films like this rather than pay £6 to see it in the cinema...They just aren't worth paying for... It is just so much fancy screwing gum for the eyes with a bit of comedy thrown in....'Transformers' meets 'fast and furious' meets 'american pie'....Morons....Box office hit? Box office sh*t more like...","Jul 16, 2007",3,/10
"I thought this was by far the best of the 2007 summer movies so far. The action was great, the acting was surprisingly good and I actually respect Michael Bay as a director now. The few complaints I would have is some of the action is so fast it is hard to keep up with it, but I understand they had to shoot it this way to make the effects work. Also the movie was just a little too long. But this seams to be a Modern trend in action movies(I guess they do not want to cut out expensive effects scenes) So If you were a fan of the cartoon you MUST go see this movie, and even if you weren't it is still well worth your time and money.","Jul 4, 2007",9,/10
For the people who forgot that summer for movies were about the big action blockbusters. Not the academy award winning movies of the winter. I went in to transformers thinking it was gonna be good or just plain ole crap. It was very good. This summer was a disappointment for blockbusters. For god sake die hard 4 is considered good after having to sit through the cheesy mindless spiderman 3 or the pirates of the Caribbean 3: when time stops. This movie embraces everything the old summer movies use to achieve. I was also glad to see they went the independence day route and what i mean by that is that they did not go out and spend tons of money on big stars who are set in their ways. Remember when independence day came out will smith was still just the fresh prince. I hope they go on to a sequel and preferablly and adaptation to the original cartoon movie if thats even possible.,"Jul 10, 2007",8,/10

"...But that's really not saying much. It is, after all, a Michael Bay product.OK. I finally got around to watching it. I'm not at all a fan of Michael Bay movies but this one was somewhat better than that gag-inducing Armageddon. Actually, the only reason I decided to watch it at all was because I saw that Shia LeBeouf was in it and I liked his work in Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull. Anyway, let's see:PLUSES:Shia's work was good in this oneDecent story(really not necessary to mention this) Great CGI workGood sound designMINUSES:That (or THOSE; it was never really clear)stupid cutesy mini-bots with the Ewok-like vocalizationsMediocre character developmentUnbelievably crappy, bad, cringeworthy dialog - especially the Transformers themselves (""looks like a cool place to KICK IT??"" PUH-LEEEZ!!!)less than impressive acting by several principles most notably Jon Voight and Megen Fox (yeah, she was damn hot but that's not enough)Some shots - especially a lot of the important CGI action scenes were shot SO CLOSE to the camera I couldn't tell WTF was going onMichael Bay and his thrice-damned, now severely over used shaky-cambad... well I should really say bland and unimpressive score - with one instance of blatant and shameless THEFT of the menacing ""bum bum bum bumbump"" drum cadence from TERMINATOR (as if we wouldn't notice??)earsplittingly crappy closing credits noise... uhh I mean ""music""Too long of a run time. Just too too much explosions, crashes, buildings collapsing (all lovingly filmed too close with the aforementioned shaky-cam), etc.I will say this: I never watched the original cartoon. I never saw the 80s vintage movie. I never owned or played with a Hasbro Xformer toy. This was my very first full exposure to the franchise (probably my last, too, as I was sufficiently unimpressed with this one to feel compelled to watch the sequel).Oh... I also have to ask: How the hell does a 30 foot-tall, 50 thousand pound bipedal robot turn into a 16 foot long 3000 pound CAR? And if these things could transform, why choose the inefficient shape of a biped if they could convert instead into helicopters or jets carrying similar armament? Why do robots gasp and grunt like WWF wrestlers when they take a blow or fall down????? Are in-line skates the best mode of transportation when chasing an adversary who has taken the shape of a tractor-trailer?Stupid. Stupid and mindless but more or less entertaining in that turn-your-brain-COMPLETELY-off-and-just-let-it-happen way. I'm very glad I didn't drop $10 to see this in the theater; my computer monitor was sufficient. And one viewing was sufficient, too. This one gets a 55/100 on the ablebravo scorecard.","Sep 19, 2010",5,/10
"I have heard so many people gripe and complain about the Transformers Live action movie that I simply had to put in my own two cents.For those of you complaining that there was a lack of plot in this movie, well HELLO!?!? It's a movie about Giant Alien robots who transform into cars and trucks, what kind of plot did you expect it to have? Michael Bay did an *excellent* job bringing the transformation to as realistic terms as possible, I love the live action Transformers movie. To hell with what everyone else says.I don't care! Have your opinions about the thing, but I thought it was a really well done ACTION flick, with incredible CGI and some sarcastic humor thrown in.I don't care about: ""Wahhh Bumblebee is supposed to be a bug! ::fanboy cries::"" guess what? They can transform into whatever the hell they want, we're going for realism here, and what is cooler then a Camaro? Nothing! Nothing is cooler then that.If you want to see a really great action film with fantastic special effects and humor thrown in, go see this movie!!","Oct 22, 2007",10,/10

"I have never sat silent in a theater as the credits rolled on a movie I had just enjoyed. I usually clap, or laugh, or talk excitedly to my friends about it. With this one, I needed a minute to savor the emotions I was feeling. I had, for the first time in my life, felt true love for something other than a woman.This is a truly great film. Compared to this movie, No Country For Old Men, another film I like, is garbage.The visual effects are spectacular even if you don't understand the complexity of either getting the right shot or creating the CGI necessary to make it look real. Any and all flaws about lighting or the transition of sunlight are pathetic compared to the visual masterpiece they ultimately created. These robots look real! The fights look real. The characters react to them as if they were real.People criticize the stupidity of the film. Yes, it is stupid. So? The film flows well; every scene not only works, but helps to explain the situation a bit more, helps to reveal a bit more about the characters,and helps to move the story along. So what if we don't find out about the global reaction to alien robots fighting a war on our planet; you're already complaining about how long the movie is! I did not grow up on the original Transformers; I had to settle for the toys and the Beast Wars show; but I still loved the mythology. This film captures it perfectly, accentuating the most important themes without complicating things with unnecessary dialog and explanations (ahem, Episode I...).My favorite element? The score! No film's music has ever captured my attention like this one. I still hum the damn tune as I walk my dog each night. The producers realized that they had struck gold; watch the trailers for the second movie; the music and sounds are mostly the same.This is a great film! Great on television, yes, but it will never be the same if you do not watch it in theaters. I saw it three times there, and I will do at least as much when Revenge of the Fallen comes out.See this movie! Michael","Jun 2, 2009",10,/10

"I grew up on cartoons like Transformers, G. I. Joe and He-man, I had all the action figures and watched almost every episode as a kid. So I have long anticipated a live-action rendition of my all-time favorite cartoon series. And thankfully, the filmmakers did a superb job.As most die-hard Transformers fans will appreciate, they did the series justice by staying close to the original storyline and using most of the original characters. They even went as far as to cast Peter Cullen, who provided the voice of Optimus Prime throughout the series.Even if you aren't already a fan of the hit cartoon series, this movie delivers. The acting and dialog deserve passing grades, the action rarely stops and the special effects are through the roof. For instance, whenever a robot transforms, you can see hundreds of moving parts, hinting at the amount of work that went into the effects. The detail is intricate and enjoyable to watch over and over.In closing, this is an outstanding film based on an awesome franchise, it provides plenty of thrills and excitement for viewers of all ages.","Jul 17, 2007",10,/10

"Back in 2005 Steven Spielberg made War of the Worlds and said at the time ""I want this movie to be the movie of the decade"".Instead, War of the Worlds 2005 was a total cop out with scenes copied from the original, ridiculous loopholes and vastly understated action sequences. Most especially when the army came up against the machines, which left me feeling flat.This is definitely not the case with Michael Bays Transformers. It's everything WotW should have been and what a 'Summer Blockbuster' should be in my opinion. It's full of action, great characters, funny one-liners, awesome special effects, a solid storyline and a well thought out translation to screen.If I have any gripes about the movie it's that the final battle was a tad confusing at times but that will entail a repeat viewing soon which will be well worth it.When you go to see it (and this is a must see movie) whatever you do, don't be late getting to your seat because Transformers kicks into high gear from the very first minutes.","Jul 4, 2007",8,/10
"I should say now that I wasn't a huge Transformers fan growing up. Where I lived I couldn't easily get the cartoons and so on, so I only had a smattering of it now and then.But even then this movie was terrible.I'm not going to comment at length as others had on the focus on lame human characters in a movie essentially about giant robots. It might even be considered aside the point that these robots have had 20 years of refined character but in the movie were sidelined for horny teenagers.But what bothered me (though didn't surprise me, considering it's Michael Bay) was the simple extensive focus on American things.I understand, and it's okay, that the focus is on America. Most movies are. But the movie tried to pretend that an invasion from hostile alien robots only happened to Americans. This is quite silly.What really got to me though, was that in a movie with, again, giant cool robots with alien technology and so on... Michael Bay was showcasing American military hardware. This could be fine in any of his other random summer action flicks, but in a movie with, I repeat, giant robots, it's stupid at best. We don't need to know, with Tom Clancy detail, about the weapons on American fighter jets. We don't care, or at least we shouldn't, when there are, again, Giant Robots to fill the screen regarding technology and action. It just seems like he doesn't know how else to make a movie if it doesn't zoom in on a fighter and tell you its schematics.This, among the other points that other commenters have said with frequency, makes Transformers not just disappointing to fans, but just a nonsensical movie which, at its very best, is just bad and not to be taken seriously. Or hilarious, because it takes itself too seriously for the (lack of) quality in the plot.","Dec 11, 2008",1,/10
"When I first heard they were coming out with a live action Transformers movie I knew I had to go see it and I'm glad I did. It was well worth the price of admission brought to the screen by director Michael Bay who does a great job bringing this film to life. It does have some flaws but this movie was definitely better than expected and the good more than outweighed the bad. I preferred this first film over it's sequel Revenge of the Fallen which was disappointing compared to this one but hey thats me. The movie Transformers is about a young teen named Sam Witwicky (played perfectly by Shia LaBeuof) who finds himself caught in the middle of an epic war between two rival clans of alien robots, the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons after buying his first car an old beat-up Camaro (which turns out to the heroic Autobot Bumblebee). For those of you who haven't seen it yet I won't give anymore of the plot away then that. This film has dazzling special effects including the transformers themselves and just the right amount of intense action sequences that are well executed. There's also plenty of humor that balanced well between the drama, suspense, and action. Shia Labeouf is solid as the lead bringing a lot of comic relief to his role as Sam and he's believable as the character. LaBeouf does sort of sit it out in the beginning (action wise) but once the chase between the Autobots and Decepticons is on he's involved in the action a lot more. Megan Fox is all right as Sam's love interest Mikaela but she isn't given much to do except to be eye candy for the camera. Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duahmel are okay but their roles in the film seemed to get smaller as the film went on because most of the focus is on Sam but they both did a good job in their limited screen time. The movie could've done without some of the side characters played by Anthony Anderson and Rachel Taylor who are decent in the movie but that would've given more screen time to LaBeouf or any of the other characters. Jon Voight does his best as the Secretary of Defense Keller and John Turturro is very impressive as Simmons a wacky agent from Sector 7 a mysterious branch of the government with many secrets that are revealed. The rest of the supporting cast are good including the real military soldiers who are given extended appearances throughout the film. The special effects are state of the art some of the best I've seen in a long time including the transformers of course. The Autobots including Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, and Jazz all looked amazing especially when they transform because you felt as if they were really there. They may not show up for almost an hour into the movie except for Bumblebee but they're given at least some character development after they're introduced so you do come to care about them especially when the action kicked into high gear something the sequel lacked. The evil Decepticons looked cool but most of them weren't given enough screen time and have little to no dialogue. Megatron and Starscream aren't introduced until late into the movie before the climax in the city but they're effective as the villains. The only Decepticons to get any sort of development were Blackout, Barricade, and Frenzy but even they're MIA for large parts of the film only showing up for several extended appearances. The two characters I was a bit disappointed in were Bonercusher and Scorponok. Bonecrusher has a couple of scenes in the third act including a brief fierce fight with Optimus near the climax but he's rather easily defeated. Scorponok shows up for a few times in the beginning before disappearing for the rest of the film. The character has a 5 second cameo in the sequel near the end before being killed off that seemed pointless which made me wonder why they just didn't kill him off in this one. There's also a Decepticon tank thats credited as Devastator but it's real name is Brawl. The character didn't seem necessary like some of them except for one maybe two action/fight sequences. Devastator was later used for the sequel but unfortunately the character ended up being a disappointing villain like The Fallen. Barricade also disappears later on with no explanation and fans of the character don't expect him to make an appearance in the sequel either because he's still MIA but I guess like Scorponok, Brawl, and Bonecrusher they served their purpose despite only have a few minutes of screen time. The action packed finale between the robots and the military was intense but the shaky camera movements and the close ups made it hard to see what was actually happening at times but they worked for the film. Despite it's flaws Transformers is still an entertaining action adventure. Overall I very much enjoyed this movie and I thought it was just as good as The Bourne Ulimatum that came out that same year. It was better than Pirates 3 and Spider-man 3 which were disappointments compared to those two movies or most recently The Dark Knight which is still one my favorite films and probably won't be topped bu who knows. Even with a lengthy running time of 143 minutes Transformers is sure to please any die hard fan of the genre with plenty of action, suspense, humor, and good performances by the cast.","May 9, 2009",9,/10
"Movies like Transformers are a double edged sword. On the same list as all superhero films, avant garde films like Pulp Fiction or Brokeback Mountain, or straight family films like Shrek or any Pixar film, you either love em or hate em. My husband is a huge fan of the cartoon-I am a product of the 80's and always watched ""My Little Pony"" and ""Strawberry Shortcake"". Transformers was for boys. I never watched it but I knew who a few of the characters were.I didn't expect much from the film-I thought Michael Bay, bad actors, cheesy lines and pretty good effects. I really underestimated it. Actors were good, not many cheesy lines, effects ""off the hook"" ( i never use that word). You've never seen effects like this before. Un-freaking-believable.Love it or hate it, just see it truly to be entertained. Most people expect films to change the world, I go to escape reality.

"This movie is action, action, and more action. Something that I wasn't sure if I actually wanted to see. After driving 20 miles to see the new Harry Potter film, and discovering that it had just sold out moments before my arrival, I figured, ""f**k you, I'm not wasting 20 miles of valuable time driving, and money on gas."" So Transformers it was. The movie started off slow, however, picked up rather quickly. Micheal Bay did a brilliant job at attempting to balance plot and action, as well as slating half-way decent actors that made the plot at least somewhat believable.A definite recommendation for people who have yet to see this movie, or are having doubts about it.I give this movie a 8/10Good for all ages :)","Jul 13, 2007",8,/10

The humour was laughable and it was interesting to see the whole storyline unfold slowly. Ah, yes, I musn't forget the real star of the show: Optimus Prime, voiced by the ever-young Peter Cullen.

"Typical Michael Bay movie but even more dumbed down than usual.Is it too much to ask that the camera stay still for more than 5 seconds so we might learn something about the plot or characters? Similarly the score is always over the top, blaring and insulting to your intelligence. Any time anything happens we get blasted by music as if the movie is saying ""look how cool this is"" even though its just a scene with a dog pissing on a transformer's foot.Even the special effects are wasted because the camera doesn't sit still long enough for you to appreciate the detail.Please for the love of God do not go and see this in the cinema because if you do they will think its successful and make a sequel.Watch the animated movie instead it has 10 times the depth of this.","Jul 9, 2007",3,/10

"To begin let me say that over the last number of years I have watched with disgust as movies, books and art moved towards martyrism and over-sexualising humanity. I have stopped going to most movies and am surprised on rare occasion to find a movie I can enjoy. 300 was fantastic, but when I heard about Transformers coming out I figured, ""How are they going to butcher this thing?"" being an old Transformers fan. Then I went to the movie, and I was for a lack of better words amazed. Optimus' voice being the classic Optimus, Jazz sounding like his cartoon equivalent was amazing.

The first time I saw the big rig come on screen transform and announce to Sam, ""I'm Optimus Prime, leader of the AutoBots!"" I almost squealed with glee. This movie did an excellent job at taking a franchise from the 80's and making a script most everyone could follow and the fact that they've left it open for a sequel I can only hope the studio will do one.If you haven't seen this movie go see it you will love it and the action sequences are out of this world!

"When I first got word they were making a live action version of Transformers, I'll admit, I got excited. Now I'm not Michael Bay fan, though I do enjoy a handful of his films--so when he was announced the director, I shrugged. I figured if anyone was going to direct a movie about giant robots turning into cars, then who else to make it than Michael Bay.Anyway--I saw the movie today and felt compelled to write something about it. I've seen that so far it has received good reviews from fans on this site as well as a lot of positive praise all over the internet, which COMPLETELY baffles me! What are you guys seeing that I'm not? Did we watch the same movie or was the cut of this thing I saw some kind of rough cut piece of crap. Okay, let me break it down into pros and cons, because everything has two sides.Okay--the good: 1.) Hot chicks 2.) Explosions 3.) Cool climax at the end That's it. So many things were happening in this film that annoyed me that I never really felt comfortable about anything going on nor care about any of the characters.Okay--the bad: 1.) First the Transformers, since most of you seeing this movie are going to see them.--Stupid stereotypes: Jazz was a ghetto robot, Bumblebee was basically Junkion from Transformers (1986).--They look stupid and during battles, you can't tell who is who.--They all have terrible lines.--You don't care about them, because they have zero character.--The bad guys die very easily.--No suspense in the battle scenes, because, well--you can't tell what's happening.--Shockwave was like the Jar Jar Binks of the Transformer movie.Now for other bad things: 2.) Horrible script--it was like the Terminator. These robots traveled millions of miles to find a pair of GLASSES ON EBAY?! What the hell?! Who wrote this script? It was so stupid. And people are complaining that Spiderman 3 was terrible, yet are giving this movie such endless praise...man, I must be on the wrong planet.3.) Bad editing--So much is going on that I don't think anyone involved in this project knew what they were doing. Or what was happening or why. When it came to watching this thing, my eyes hurt! 4.) Horrible music.5.) Some of the worst battles I've ever seen. $150 million dollars to make it and you still couldn't see what has happening on the screen. The smaller battles worked for me, but the big city climax was a bit over the top and so badly constructed that I didn't even know who was dying.6.) 2D characters--but that's a small compliant. You don't go into a movie like this for good characters anyway, right? It's a Summer Blockbuster and you go to see the big bangs, the robots, a hot girls running around.7.) Lame coming of age story.8.) All the subplots could have been cut--I mean it was like four different movies going on at the same time that you, as a viewer, had no idea who the movie wanted you to care about: Boy and his car, Soldier trying to get home to his wife and kids, a woman who works for the government and her hacker friend who likes donuts, and a dog with a broken leg. Come on, choice a central character and let the audience follow them! 9.) Tried to be funny, but wasn't.I don't know, maybe I should stop now. I mean it's bad enough I wasted money to see this stupid movie and now I'm wasting more time on it tell you why I hated it. Chances are a lot of you will still go and see it and that's fine, but be warned. This is not as good as people are telling you. People from the ages of 10 to 18 will love it. Men between the ages of 18-25 will love it too, unless they are film majors. If I were you, I'd use my money and see something good like Ratatouille, Live Free or Die Hard, or anything else at the box office. This was a waste! I wouldn't even download this movie for free to watch it again--that's how bad it is.Well I warned you.","Jul 6, 2007",4,/10

I wasn't interested. So there wasn't any real baggage involved either side of the coin.The plot may have been a little unrealistic and some of the acting a little sketchy at times.Even the 1986 Transformers film wasn't perfect.Summer 2007 has been really mediocre for blockbuster films, as we're apparently supposed to lower our standards.Then the films auteur had to take it there by making Jazz the Transformer with the Black-American soul, screaming.","Oct 16, 2014",10,/10
":) Forgive the title. I simply couldn't help myself. Well, on with my review. Put quite simply, I fell in love with this movie. I was skeptical at first about how a (sometimes cheesy) cartoon and comic book would translate to the film. We have seen it happen successfully with other characters of course, but alien robots? :D Well, I went in with an open mind and I was not disappointed. Every minute of this film was filled with either 'edge of your seat' action, or 'rolling in the aisles' humour. And in many cases both were expertly put together.The special effects and writing were absolutely wonderful in this film, where even cheesy bits from old school Transformers made both serious and humorous transitions to the big screen. I loved the witty banter that came from some of the characters, just as much as I loved watching the rolling transformations of the Transformers. Additionally, the soundtrack for this film was absolutely breathtaking, especially the Autobots Arrival and the one playing when the soldiers are fighting the decepticon in Quatar.And the actors themselves. Well they were wonderfully chosen. Even the voice actors. Having the same person voice Optimus Prime in the film as had in cartoons and video games was a wonderful touch. But for me, the best choice was Shia LaBeouf. Shia has proved that he has a wonderful on-camera presence whereby he can play a wide range of roles. His ability to perform in tense action scenarios combined well with his ability to keep an audience in fits of laughter. :) He totally made the movie for me.I remember sitting in the movie theatre on the first night the Transformers preview came out. Everyone was on the edge of their seats trying to find out what this exciting movie was called (it was a very brief initial preview consisting of video footage from Mars). When Tansformers flashed onto the screen the entire theatre erupted in laughter. Well I hope everyone involved in making this film is laughing now, because they created a hit that people will want to watch again and again. I know I will.Everyone, go rent, borrow, buy this film. You will not be disappointed! P.S. And just so you know. I rarely give things a ten out of ten. :)","Sep 23, 2007",10,/10

It's terrific that the film don't alienate previous non-fans or people who'd never seen it.Loved the fight with megatron and megatron's new skellington-like form it makes him so frightening ^^ I only find it slightly disappointing that they didn't include the part where both megatron and optimus say ""hello brother"" in the novel version of the film because it's like they acknowledge each other as equals and the same but thats a small price to pay.

"I am a fan of the cartoon and comic book, but this movie was a lame effort to recreate such a plot with phony characters and cheap dialog. What bothered me the most was the masturbation joke. Whats wrong with the writers today, they all think sex sells and this is a PG movie. Its not a big deal for me because I'm mature, but a 6-8 year old who sees the movie will ask questions. This is just a clue that this movie was a marketing scheme looking to make a buck with no effort in writing a intelligent movie- Michale Bay makes high production movies with no plot. I will be more hesitate towards watching his next feature, and those two writers are on my do not watch list. The only selling prospect of the movie was its animation and cliché phrases from the cartoon series, such as: 'Autobots, roll out'. This movie was too long. Jon Voight must be hurting for some notoriety or money to make such a crap movie.","May 9, 2008",2,/10
"When I saw the trailer for Transformers, I knew right away that it was going to be amazing. And I was right. When I went to see it, of course, like most other major features, the theater was completely packed and I almost couldn't get a seat. The movie was incredible though. It basically had everything a smash-hit summer movie should have: action/adventure, comedy, romance (you know what I mean :) ), OK maybe not everything but it had a lot. I absolutely loved it overall. The acting was incredible, CGI awesome, story-line fantastic, and Shia Lebouf did an incredible job as the lead role and so did Megan Fox as his co-star. I give it 5 thumbs up. It was so good that it's still in theaters. I also loved the fact that is the only non-sequel in history (I think), to have grossed the most money on opening weekend.","Aug 20, 2007",10,/10

"I was not prepared for what I saw. I really had very low expectations for the Transformers. I thought it was a ""kids"" movie, so I waited until it was on DirecTv (in this case, Cinemax). That said, the Transformers was outstanding!!! I want to give it a ""10"" but I can't justify that. That said, it's the best SCI-FI/action with CGI that I can think of. And yes, in a different sort of way, it beats ""The Matrix"". HOWEVER, that said, I'd easily rate ""The Matrix"" higher. But, depending on what you're looking for, the Transformers rules! The CGI for the Transformers is ridiculously perfect. It's better than anything I've seen. It's so realistic. Yes, I've seen many of the ""great"" CGI efforts, but in total, this is right up there with the best. And the acting, which almost takes second stage, is absolutely flawless. Shia LaBeouf is terrific, Rachael Taylor is a great new find and does a perfect job, Megan Fox is also perfect (as is the rest of the cast). I hope this isn't a spoiler (I'd mark my message as such, if I thought it was) but the music is perfectly timed - in a ""Michael Bay"" sort of way. I'm really falling in ""like"" with Michael Bay's stuff. All I can say is that you'll enjoy and are in for a pleasant surprise with the Transformers. It's a great family (older) and adult film.","May 13, 2008",9,/10

"I was skeptical at first to see transformers as I thought it would just another nerdy sci-fi film. I must say though when I saw the film, it exceeded my expectations, it was the film that surprised me most this year. The only real aspect that drove me to the film was the director, Michael Bay as his previous films are awesome (Bad Boys 1 and 2, The Rock). Not only does the film feature gigantic transforming robots but it is action packed, with slices of humour and heroism especially from Josh Duhamel, it also features some famous faces (Jon Voight, Jon Tuturro and Anthony Anderson just to name a few) and also a sappy love story between the main character, the nerdy Sam Witwicky.At first the idea of cars, trucks, planes etc transforming into giant alien robots was outrageous to me at first but the concept combined with explosive action sequences made this film all the more enjoyable. For those thinking that this movie is just a copy of the cartoon, it is not. Bay has transformed the cartoon into this highly action packed realistic looking film, that surely does entertain and will not leave an audience bored. If you fall asleep in this movie, you must be narcoleptic! Transformers is far from a kid's movie, although the story is originally a kid's one. It's clearly apart of the action/adventure genre. For all action fans it is a must see and even if your not and your just bored and want to watch a movie that provides many thrills this is also a movie for you. In my opinion this movie is a transformer of the action genre, probably the first movie since Die Hard (1988).Definitely in my top 10!","Dec 27, 2007",10,/10

"I sat down watched it and didn't leave my seat; I didn't even get bored and got on my phone. It was just so perfect and when it seemed like it was gonna get repetitive it pulled me back in. Last time I saw this I was about 6 and rewatching it with no memory of it made it better. I forgot so much it felt like watching it for the first time. Which made it feel even better and more enjoyable. With newer movies most of them care about a message but don't try to pull in viewers to enjoy the ride. I hope the new one is just as good as this was. With this being such a great movie, I can't wait to see the 2nd one. 10/10.","Dec 9, 2022",10,/10

"OK a little disclaimer first: yes critics hate it, but then again I hate movies that critics praise. I did not find anything wrong with this movie, any flaws are minor and hardly worth mentioning.Soundtrack - excellent, pleasant, well-timed, has some rock songs which must be what scared the critics.CGI - I don't even need to say anything, do I? Robots look truly amazing, I wish I've seen it when it was on big screen. And definitely a good idea to redesign them from the blocky simple cartoons this was based on. About those comments that mention that it was hard to tell which robot was which, well you should actually pay attention, Bay included a couple scenes on purpose in which all the robots on both sides are presented together with their names. I had no trouble telling them apart.Special effects - just as good.Action - fast-paced, desert scene reminiscent of Black Hawk Down. Robot fights are fluid and quick, unlike some action movies where the hero and the villain fight for half an hour in the end.Plot - an interesting sci-fi premise, and believable as such, although the 'surprise' ending is predictable. Has the usual geek-likes-hot-girl-that-goes-out-with-a-jock beginning which could ruin a movie, but, thankfully, uses it only to introduce Shia's and Megan's characters.Dialog might not be worth entering a poetry contest, but it goes along with the movie's pace well and has plenty of quotable moments.Acting - in my opinion, the actors were great, conveying emotions and delivering dialogue lines well. Not sure what critics don't like about them. Some critics complain about slow motion shots of Megan, but there are much more slow motion shots of robots than her. One of them even had to be included as it fits well with the dialogues and entire scene.Humor - surprisingly, IMDb doesn't even list comedy as one of the genres for this movie. It had several hilarious moments, scenes, and characters. I was pleasantly surprised by those, and I give credit to Bay for including them rather than trying to make a purely serious movie. I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie as much without them.To add to that, I did watch Transformers like good 10-15 years ago, and hardly remembered them except for a few characters' names. The memories did make me very curious about this movie though, and I definitely wasn't disappointed.","Jun 24, 2009",10,/10
"I was never a transformers fan I watched the beast wars series but i always consider it not a part of the transformers universe. Besides this the other transformers cartoon shows i always founded them to much for kids.Since we live in a time when every comic book and cartoon show seems to get to the big screen you just don't know what to expect. I'm just glad i gave Transformers a chance i would have missed one of the best movies ever. The transformers are not the silly designs from the cartoon they are well done realistic CGI. Just to see them on the screen coming to life.. it's hard to put the feeling into words but i haven't felt that good watching a movie in a long time.It's true that some characters could have used more screen time but with so many characters it's hard to propally introduce all of them. Anyway you will start loving Bumblebee see the hero that Optimus is, Ironhide also seems to prove to be a great and the evilness of the Decepticons.The plot is not that spectacular if you think it in detail but with all the action and cool giant robots you tend to forget about it. In all this movie will prove a great movie to watch and trust me you will not regret this movie. Om my personal list Transformers beats the Terminator series any day.","Dec 8, 2007",10,/10
"Well like many i was expecting this to bomb but was more than pleasantly surprised to be proved wrong. From the beginning the voice-over by Prime sent shivers down my spine bringing all that i loved about transformers flooding back.The story moves at a fair pace and the action is slick and tight with hardly a moment wasted. The balance between having to explain whats going on and on screen advancement is smooth and flawless.My only and biggest complaint which has been covered is the lack of character from the robots. Their generic look makes it hard to identify with any of them and in fight sequences is so easy to loose track of whos who. Only Prime retains any semblance of what he looked like in the cartoons. I wasn't expecting and would never want a straight copy to CGI of what they had looked like, but im sure they could have given them at least a passing resembelance to their robot form. As for the veichle mode it hardly matters that bumblebee isn't a VW, its the robot form we most associate with. My own thought is that the film wanted to show off its CGI and made them far more robot like with thousands of moving part and a sharp edgy look. but by doing so they took away their character, it would be like taking batmans bat suit away and leaving him with pointy ears. Every hero and villain needs a recognisable identity if the audience is to show any connection with them. That aside its a great popcorn film and has you hooked on whats gonna happen next. Defo one to see","Jul 7, 2007",8,/10
"Transformers is the most atrocious and torturing experience of my life. Every moment, I was watching, i wished to end soon. But, NO. The great michael bay dragged it into a 150 minute torture. How cool you make the action scenes, but if there is no proper situation build up and right emotion in it, then its a total failure. There is no character development, no kind of relationship developed between shia and the transformers. Cheap jokes and uninteresting subplots tests my patience to the core. But the biggest culprit are the audience who made this crap successful and inspired bay to turn it into a franchise.","Jun 12, 2020",1,/10
"Remember about 11 years ago, when some giant flying saucers hovered over Earth, people in computer labs intercepted signals, and a few protagonists around the globe slowly marched toward their role in saving the Earth, with plenty of involvement from the military along the way? Transformers, not surprisingly, nearly duplicates this plot. To call it an homage to Independence Day maybe be giving director Michael Bay too much credit, but in any case it doesn't really matter. I would call Transformers more exciting, more visceral, and ten times more pulse pounding than the patriotic Earth against aliens film of 11 years ago. True, it does lack in coherent plot and character development, but all that will be completely forgotten once you see these titanium titans clash.Shia LeBeouf, as always competently playing a young affable teenager, plays Sam Witwicky, a high schooler who has a crush and purchases a car to impress her. Little does he know his car is actually an Autobot, the good guy half of a race of biogenic aliens, on Earth to investigate if something called the Cube is there, a super-powerful object that could enable the Decepticons, the bad guy half, to destroy all life on Earth and create their own robotic planet. Several subplots abound, including a middle Eastern one with a young general played by Josh Duhamel and a Pentagon/Washington one with the secretary of Defense played by Jon Voight (good, of course, but not very memorable).Oh, Jon Voight could have easily given a full-out performance, but he's not going to kid himself. It's not about him. It's about the bombastically bad-ass battling bots. The crashing metal and strangely modulated towering voices. The leaning forward in your seat to catch every detail during the fantastic battle scenes, which, had they been done wrong, would have made the movie a complete flop. Fortunately for all of us, the effects do not disappoint in any way. I got exactly everything I was expecting, and then some. The effects and action are perfectly entertaining and serve up a healthy platter of adrenaline-pumping, pulse-pounding, teeth-clenching robot butt-kicking. The final battle scene is so mind-blowing and perfect in its execution that the robots almost seem graceful as they smash and crash all over the place. This isn't art, it's entertainment, and it's wonderfully done entertainment from the sometimes overly-criticized Michael Bay.I'll admit, when I first saw the trailer, I was very excited, but then I saw Bay's name plastered across the movie screen. I was like, ""Crap. He directed the Island, didn't he? CRAP. Armageddon. Oh sh--. Pearl Harbor. Bad Boys II. Bad boys. The Rock.I'm going to hate this movie, aren't I?"" Coming out of the theater, though, I realized there really wasn't anyone else who could have created a spectacle of this magnitude. Bay never lets anything else but the robots take center stage, and boy what a chaos-ridden magnificent stage it turns out to be. A conglomeration of product placement and sheer heavy metal, it's a wonder anything here manages to shine through. Voight, the pathetic script, the non-existent plot, all of them pale in comparison with the towering transformers, but of all people, LeBoeuf manages to make the biggest impression, emerging straight out of backwater, mediocre sci-fi action pics like I,Robot and Constantine to come straight into the public eye with this sure-fire massive moneymaker, bringing an incredibly personal and easygoing element to this otherwise jam-packed roller-coaster ride of a movie. If anybody but LeBoeuf had been in the main role, the entire thing would have felt like a impersonal spectacle designed solely to make money out of a toy franchise. Sure, it's all those things and more, but in a world of crashing metal and falling debris it's always good to have a character you can relate to and laugh with, and LeBoeuf pulls off that character effortlessly.I'm not going to mince any words on trying to explain the plot further or pretending like there's anything more to this movie than what I've already talked about. After watching this movie I knew two things. 1. Giant Battling Robots are the Coolest Thing Ever. 2. For some reason I really wanted a GMC truck and some Mountain Dew. (Can you believe that at one point a Mountain Dew machine transforms into a Decepticon?) Though the product placement may get out of control sometimes, it didn't really bother me, and what do you expect in a movie that features talking cars? No car label at all? Give me a break.Transformers was advertised as nothing more than a jet-fueled, action-propelled roller-coaster, and it delivers in every way. It reminded me a little bit of Alien Vs. Predator, which came out a couple of years ago, but made the mistake of setting the epic confrontation between the two alien races a few thousand feet underneath the arctic, with about three total confrontations between the aliens and the predators. Transformers isn't afraid to go rampaging in broad daylight, obliterating much of downtown LA. It also beats out its similar predecessor, Independence Day, in that it doesn't waste too much screen-time trying to develop the paper-thin personalities of numerous unimportant small characters. (ID had about six or seven of those, fifteen if you count the whole cast.) Most of the action thankfully centers around LeBoeuf and the Pentagon, never distracting too much from the film's central theme: Transformers. Heck, Transformers may even be the central summer flick of 2007. It's that epic, that good, and that satisfying. Now let's all sit down, and wait patiently for Transformers 2, because the film leaves it wide open and nearly begging for a sequel. Thank goodness.","Jul 7, 2007",8,/10
"From the moment Optimus Prime began narrating, I knew I chose the wrong movie to see. From hokey narration we go immediately to senselessly blowing lots of stuff up. Michael Bay took the action coloring book, stayed in the lines well enough, but used all the wrong colors, maybe all the same color. Action movies can be brilliant, even some of Bay's own films. This one wasn't.The Cube has crash landed on earth, and both the Autobots and Decepticons are looking for it. Without a doubt, the robots look absolutely awesome, these are simply the greatest special effects in a film to date. That said, the Decepticons, the bad guys, essentially all look the same. Honestly, this doesn't matter, because nothing in the script or the story does anything to distinguish any of them anyway. The Autobots on the other hand, are drawn to show plenty of character individually, but only two really get any attention from the film makers development-wise. Perhaps half way through the movie was just too late to start introducing the good guys.It's impossible to tell if the acting is good or not. Like the Star Wars sequels, the script is just that bad. I'm pretty sure Megan Fox was pretty weak, though. LaBeouf has a style all his own, the way he delivers lines, he kind of attacks naturalness, but once you get used to it, it's actually easy to like.Don't expect any surprises in plot. Don't expect any sort of sophisticated humor, besides a decent attempt when Sam (LaBeouf) picks out his car. Other than that, it's all pee jokes and boy/girl awkwardness. Dramatic lines like, ""Megatron must be stopped no matter the cost,"" and, ""Freedom is the right of all sentient beings,"" come off painfully banal and unjustified.Halfway through, I realized I didn't care what happened, or, I already knew what was going to happen, and just didn't care to watch a story I could have told in 20 seconds. Go, take a nap, wake up and see some good special effects, then go back to catching up on some sleep.","Jul 16, 2007",5,/10

"Action in this film could be very claustrophobic. But there were some scenes that blew my mind as well. I usually don't get headaches during films, and I love loud stuff, but only Black Hawk Down gives me a worse headache. The action does not let up. Worth going deaf, I admit that. The CGI lighting effects are awesome, the CGI blending in with real automobiles and aircraft is standard setting. Fake one minute, real the next, and that equals realistic robots! The role played by Shia Lebouf was really funny. He could be the next Tom Hanks. He is going to be a big star. Love the role by John Turturro. I was really angered and annoyed by him. Voight needs to retire and make up with Angelina, and cameos by Anthony Anderson and Bernie added humor. Lots of humor in this film, surprised, I was hoping for more darkness. R rating and it would be the best film of all time.","Jul 4, 2007",8,/10
"As an old-school fan of Transformers, I can't say I was too excited about seeing it transition into a big-screen Michael Bay production. The results are actually not as bad as I had anticipated, but some of the characters' dialog is so downright awful, while watching it, I myself wanted to ""transform"" -- by which I mean extend my limbs and transplant myself out of the room in which the film was playing. (Get it?!?!?) *tumbleweeds roll by* The special effects are good for the present moment and there are some pretty sweet action scenes. I do kind of love how they're badass robots but end up fighting with typical grappling martial arts. The music is adequate epic Hollywood action-adventure symphony stuff, but then interspersed with random segments of ""nu-metal"" riffs during cheesy action sequences. And then for some reason the film ends with a Linkin Park song. Which is funny because the film already ends on such a cliché, sappy note and then gives you permanent low self-esteem with the song that plays during the end credits.Ah, I guess that's to be expected of a film that flashes Mountain Dew and Pepsi every 10 minutes and is one long commercial for GMC and the (then) new Chevy Camaro. From what I understand, enlightened cybernetic beings will one day be made from superior industrial products, which you should buy now. Oh yeah, and enlightened cybernetic beings also use dated American street slang, like ""roll out"". Natch.Pretty entertaining stuff, but so empty and cliché it's almost incredible. Everything in this movie is a macrocosm of Megan Fox's presence and role: really nice to look at, but with absolutely nothing to say at all. I mean, it's basically X-Men, but with Transformers: Blahblahblah, ""Transformers/XMen/Gargoyles/Spidermen are bad! Send in the military!"" ...rabblerabblerabble... ""Stop! Those are the GOOD Transformers/XMen/Gargoyles!!"" Blarbyblarblar... ""Humans are bad! You are friends with humans so you die!"" blahblahblah ""No! Some are good so we should let them live!""

"A bit of background - I grew up in the 80s and had Transformer toys, so I know that they are one of the coolest things ever invented, I mean, robots in disguise, how cool is that? So I saw Transformers last night, partly feeling trepidation in case it was rubbish but also excitement as the trailers looked awesome.So how was it? It was excellent! After the first scene where you get to see a transformation I knew I'd already got my money's worth! The effects are stunning - definitely a step ahead of what's been done before, and the whole thing is full-on from beginning to end. But it doesn't get old. There are explosions, loads of battles, car chases, explosions, and more explosions! There's even quite a bit of humour! And I may be almost old enough to be her father but Megan Fox is excellent eye candy too! So in short, and as you can tell, I loved this film. Definitely one for the DVD collection.","Jul 2, 2007",9,/10
"This is by far the best action movie of the year. Compare it to Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, this movie is so much better. Action movies stereotypically have simple plots, and Transformers is no different. The story is simple, keep the Decepticons from getting the All Spark. Definitely not hard to follow.I think Shia LaBeouf did a good job as Sam. He kept things light when there wasn't much action going on and he showed urgency when he had to. I have to give him props for making out with Megan Fox (Mikelea). She is smokin'.The effects in the movie are top notch. OK, so CGI will always looks a little cartoonish no matter how detailed it is. It will never have 100% correct lighting. It is pretty damn close, but nothing will ever beat models.You could go see the 4th Die Hard movie, or the 3rd Pirates movie, but in the end only one movie has the killer action.

Well lucky for me and the star the character actually fit his quirkiness to a tea. I can't say the same for the female interest of the film, who appeared much to old and sophisticated for this supposed High School geek. Of course the CGI on the autobots and decepticons was fantastic but some of the fight screens went by so fast you couldn't really see what was going on. I am also glad the movie didn't take itself too seriously. There's a lot of humor and it makes for a better movie because come on who would take this plot seriously. That's why I was so disappointed in the final battle sequences when all of a sudden everything was so serious and well dull because of it.

"First of, i often neglect IMDb's forums because, honestly there are to many dumb people here. I don't know how often i read 10 this 10 that, honestly 9/10 is a GREAT movie, if it would be granted a 10 it should be the best movie in the history. Saw Transformers earlier and me and my friend said to each other on the way to the cinema that this movie was going to be full of ""shaky action scenes"" where it is hard to even See whats happening. And yes i know the purpose of that type of scenes.The movie contained a lot of that stuff and just like every movie where Michael bay has had his foot inside the door everything is so American. I don't say that is is a bad thing, he just makes it that way in uncool way and it just gets lame in the end. The music i have to say is one of the best parts of this movie. You recognize Steve Jablonsky easily and his music. He saves the movie in many ways, scenes that would have feel totally unnecessary. This movie has been on the waiting list for lots of Transformers fans (including me) and i have to agree that it was a thrill to see all the old friends in real nice animations. However i really dislike the way the robots act many times and the how many people seem to be deaf in this movie.Overall one of Bay's better movies and was well worth to see and i think i can see it again.

"I, like many of you, grew up with Optimus Prime and the gang. They helped shape my view of robots when I was a kid (that and Robocop), so when I heard they were coming out with a movie using today's technology, I eagerly marked the date on my calender and passed the days.This movie KICKS A**. I have rarely left a theater with the feelings and emotions that Transformers left. This movie was so good and it was so easy to get caught up in, that when I left the movie, I actually thought I would see Optimus in the parking lot.Anyway, no bad reviews on this one from my end, just awesome and anyone from 12 to 60 will like this. I never give a 10 out of 10 unless I am still sitting in my seat at the theater even after everyone else has left. The graphics are amazing, and as another commenter stated, it seemed like the actors were really interacting with these robots, that is how well the movie was filmed, edited, and produced.Later Tater","Jul 4, 2007",9,/10
"OK, so let's be honest here. Was anyone really going to see Transformers for the story? Of course not! If you were than you didn't know what you were going to see. But despite a cheese factor through the roof, a mismatch of throw-away subplots that didn't quite fit and obvious plot holes such as about five characters being randomly forgotten about towards the end, the movie was never-the-less spectacular. It wasn't about the story. It was about the Transformers, the action, the explosions, and the entertainment. The CGI was beautiful, seamless, very well integrated and generally a pleasure to watch. The whole movie was nothing but eye candy. As for the entertainment, the movie felt like a really fun roller coaster and the humor and obvious cheese factor counter-balanced the action and chaos to keep it from becoming too dark. But back to the movie being about the transformers, one of my real complaints is that the transformers didn't have enough development. The movie focused too much on the humans and not enough on the transformers. We don't care about the humans so much, we care about the transformers, that's what it's about, they're the one's who take up the screen, make things interesting. But the movie did leave openings for a sequel so maybe we'll see more character development for the transformers in the second one.My other complaint is... What the hell was up with the racist crap? Did anyone else notice that they went out of their way to ghettofy Jazz, make him up to supposedly be black, and then he was the only autobot to actually get killed? Shame on Michal Bay! I was willing to over-look all the stereotypes, the Mexican guy at the beginning who refuses to speak English, the middle class family who's dad doesn't want anyone to walk on his lawn (And is the family of the main character) the computer hackers cousin busting through the glass door and getting tackled by the police, but Jazz getting ripped in two did it in. The movie's got racist issues. (By the way... I'm white... And I'm saying this...)Despite all the crap I've said. I give it 8 stars. Why? Because of what I said to begin with. It's not about the story, screw the story. It's about the transformers, the explosions and the action... And as far as all that goes... 10 stars!","Jul 7, 2007",8,/10

"I had I hopes for this film when I saw the trailers. I was always a fan of transformers, although never a devoted one. I had a couple toys, watched some shows, know a little of the Mythos, but definitely not an expert and time has faded my memories. Basically, I came in with no preconceived notions of what the film should be, which is good cause I could see how people could take the film in the wrong light. First and foremost, it's based on a cartoon so expect the story to be wacky, which it is in spades. Crazy loony toon cops, government officials (Sector 7, need I say more) and parental units. Why every American family has to be kooky and crazy in Hollywood films nowadays is beyond me. Fortunately, most of the time the wackiness leans itself well to the overall motif of the film or sets up a good one-liner( transformers is a surprisingly funny film.)Secondly, the actors are mostly throwaways, Megan fox couldn't me more stale. Even veterans of the industry disappointed, jon voight anyone? There is some miscasting, everyone playing a sector 7 official was too upsurd for my tastes, especially the head honcho. Fortunately, shia labouf is a saving grace bringing humor and good twitchy, overly anxious teenager to the screen.Now here comes the Transformers, who except for Jazz (why oh why was he so stereotypically black, do African-Americans enjoy stereotypes of themselves on screen in robot form?) are all done exceptionally well. Optimus prime and bumble bee have the most personality and are done amazingly well. I would have like to have seen more deception interaction, but it makes sense with the storyline. Just seeing them lumber around is a special effects treat and wait til you see guns ablazing, the action is an intense roller-coaster ride if there ever was one.Finally, michael bay as the director. As being a fan of Bay's work, (the island was amazing)I was pleased with his interaction with the film. Some miscasting and overly goofiness aside, he brought a great film to the screen and should be commended.","Jul 12, 2007",8,/10

"I just saw it last night in Italy and I'm extremely satisfied about this movie! I was very disappointed with Spider Man 3 and At World's End but Transformers is a great movie. I hope this film will be a success in the United States because it deserves to be a success. It's one of the most entertaining movie I've ever seen. Shia Le Bouef is a really good actor and I can't wait to see him in Indiana Jones 4. The final battle is terrific. This is probably one of the best movie directed by Michael Bay. He is not the new Kubrick or the new Spielberg but his movies are enjoyable and the critics should understand that he directs action films whose only purpose is to entertain people. Thanks Mr.Spielberg, thanks Mr. Bay! Transformers is great!","Jun 30, 2007",10,/10
"I agree with the others who appreciated this film....STOP COMPLAINING!!!! Saw the film last night and will be watching it again this week. Its THAT GOOD. I grew up watching Transformers, at first I'd have to admit I was curious why Bumblebee wasn't a VW Beetle. After seeing the movie I can appreciate why they went with the Camaro. Aside from possible sponsorship commitments it did make Bumblebee look tougher and cooler than the original BB. So get over the nostalgia and appreciate the design of the characters in this film, they're Awesome. I loved how Optimus Prime seemed more like a Ninja when he decapitated Destructor. Kudos to Michael Bay and the scriptwriters, the right mix of some adult themes and comedy makes this appealing to audience young and old. I don't know if its just me but I can't help but see Agent Smith in Megatron. Maybe its a Hugo Weaving thing but that he seemed meaner than the cartoon version. I also did ask why he wasn't a pistol. Agree with one of the previous comments, how stupid would it be if he transforms into a gun then into a 40ft robot? Loco. Anyway, if you're one of the hardcore TF fans that can't help comparing this to the 80's version of the characters and feel disappointed then you're better off watching the first movie on DVD. You'll get all the 80's Transformers you crave for there. Transformers 2K7 would have to be one of the best, if not THE BEST, cartoon-to-live CGI adaptation I've ever seen. I just hope if there are plans for a sequel (which chances are there would be) that they do as good a job or better. I would love to see the Dinobots and the Constructicons battle it out!!!!","Jun 29, 2007",10,/10

"The movie was entertaining...but at times it was almost painful. The emotions that were supposed to be poignant fell flat in EVERY scene. The only scene that came close were between father/son or mother/father. The special effects were good, no doubt. But half the time you could not figure out who was who.Bumblebee was cool. And the cars in this movie were awesome.I am glad I saw it on cable. I would have been disappointed at the theater.Might be a good flick for ages 10-12, but I think most may find themselves yawning.","May 11, 2008",3,/10
"When I came to the cinema to watch this movie, I honestly didn't have any expectation. I came only looking for a pure entertaining movie. And I know Michael Bay is the right director who can deliver ""pure entertainment"". Having seen all the Blockbuster movies of the summer (Spiderman 3, POTC :At World End and FF 4 :Rise of the silver surfer), I expect this might be just another brainless action pack CGI flick.But I was wrong. From the beginning till middle and the end of the movie, I was hanging at the edge of my seat. This movie really blows me away. And for the first time in long time, I've heard spectator applauding for a scene. The last time I've heard it dated back 20 years ago with the movie ""The Untouchables"".With all the special effects and CGI of the movie nowadays we thinks that we have seen it all. But this movie really set a new standard. The robots look pretty real and smooth. The action scene look quite realistic. As for the storyline this movie also have a very weak and unrealistic one like the other blockbuster movies. Anyway what do you expect from Michael Bay? An Oscar winning storyline?There are many funny moments in the movie, which I thinks it's good so we don't get too intense. The lead actor & actress really give their best performance. Not just mediocre one like we've seen in many science fiction movies.This movie is enjoyable for all ages and also for people who never knew the Transformer franchise.I'm not a fan of the Transformer TV Cartoon Series but this movie makes me want to know the franchise more. A good job well done by Michael Bay.","Jun 30, 2007",9,/10
"I watched TRANSFORMERS recently or should i better call it HUMANS, as the story seems to have little to do with them, and more to do with the apes encounters with the TRANSFORMERS.James Cameron should have been the one to direct, instead Michael Bay helms a crass MTV styled teen romance which might as well do without the transformers.Even Paul Anderson could have made a movie closer to the original material.On a positive note the SFX team have definitely established a milestone in CGI effects. Kudos to them. A thumbs down to Spielberg for selecting Michael Bay and the screenwriters. Hopefully Cameron or Singer helm the sequel.On a final this movie has been a slap on the face of true transformers fans.","Aug 14, 2007",4,/10
"My guess is, Transformers will be the movie to beat. Just saw it yesterday and I can't get over it. I went out of the theater with my pulse beating so fast and I was asking for more!I was in high school when I watched the cartoons. I love love Bumble bee and his relationship with Spike so much. Though they used the name Sam, it's OK no harm done. Still, Shai was so right for the part. I saw their relationship unfold before my eyes in the movie and I almost cried! gave me the chills and goosebumps. I felt so much like a high school again, only better! I love the way the story unfolded and all the dialogs were neatly connected with each other. The humor was great, it wasn't corny, it wasn't off, just perfect. Shai was perfect. He has the wit and the humor. Considering it's his first action movie, wow. I must say, GOOD JOB KID! THANK YOU MICHAEL BAY FOR GIVING US ONE HECK OF A MOVIE, IT WAS SO REAL AND SO PERFECTLY MADE, AND SO MUCH MORE.By the way, for those who said Megatron was NOT a gun, watch it again, he WAS, but only for a brief moment in the final battle with Optimus. But it was just his hands since Starscream wasn't there to pick him up anyway. Optimus stopped him so he transformed back. This might be an introduction of so much more in the next.please let there be a sequel!","Jul 1, 2007",10,/10
"Well I saw this movie last night (Australia)--June 29 2007.It was simply incredible. I salute the director and makers of this film.Everyone in the cinema really seemed to enjoy the movie and I heard people talking about it afterwards and it was all positive. I attended the movie on it's second day since opening in Australia and every session in the afternoon (and probably during the day too) was totally sold out.This movie is incredibly funny and definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the film. The story is simple to understand and perfect for this type of movie.The action was definitely present and there were some truly amazing special effects. (Best SFX you will ever see)It was great that Michael Bay incorporated the human element in the manner that he did. Too much emphasis on the transformers themselves would have made it more difficult for mainstream movie watchers to relate to them.In many ways I think that having the human element in this movie allowed the director to introduce mainstream movie watchers to the transformer characters, and then in the second movie that they do, they have a very good launch pad such that there can be more focus between transformer to transformer interaction.I've been a transformers fan since the very beginning with the 80's animated cartoon and have seen every single episode and movie of the TF. This movie was terrific and definitely has added something special to the TF universe :) Well done to Peter Cullen on his voice for Optimus Prime. He is such an integral part of transformers and his voice shined through in Bay's movie as well.Rating = 10/10","Jun 29, 2007",10,/10
"I saw an advanced screening of the movie and i was expecting a movie that was aimed more toward children. I was wrong. Since the beginning the movie sucked me in, and it still has not let go as i was so impacted by it.There is never a dull moment in the movie, it keeps you excited and pumped in the action scenes.I am to young to have watched Transformers before this movie but i constantly found myself emotionally attached to the character(especially the Transformers).All in all this movie is great and i cannot remember ever having had so much fun in a theater.","Jun 30, 2007",10,/10
"Transformers is a terrible film. I mean really, really terrible. Worse than I was expecting, and I was expecting very little. Michael Bay should be encased in concrete and buried deep in the Hoover Dam. It is insulting that a studio executive gave this project the go ahead with the script that ends up in the movie. Absolute proof that this movie exists purely to make money, sell toys and cars. No thought has gone into it WHATSOEVER. This script could literally have been written in 5 minutes. By a child. That was stillborn. Credit must go to Shia Leboeuf and Megan Fox for doing their best to disguise the cliché ridden nerd guy/pretty girl romance thing. John Turturro does all he can to keep a straight face while playing a parody of the equally overused ""secret government agency man"". Some of the dialogue given to the Autobots is just embarrassingly bad. I have never before shifted uncomfortably in my seat and felt sorry for a CGI character because of the lines he had to say. That brings me onto the transformers themselves- To look at- they are AWESOME. It is a pity that what will surely come to be regarded as a benchmark in movie visual effects is otherwise so bad. The transformation scenes, especially in close up, are staggering and they do deserve to be seen on a big screen. If you haven't seen it yet- here's my advice- take your ipod- turn it up loud and just enjoy the visuals. The script and story really don't do justice to the effects- so there's no point paying attention to them.","Aug 7, 2007",3,/10

"Poor Meghan Fox tasked with playing the sexy dumb girl and Shia who is running non stop like the Duracell bunny and meant to fall in love with each other when there is absolutely no chemistry between themWhen an actor speaks Spanish his army captain says in an angry voice ""English, dude, English"" that did it for me. What the hell was that about?Awful. Despite the good photography and special effects the script let it down badly with heavily stereotyped characters and silly and predictable actions scenes where the leading actors and the army people walk unscathed through all type of explosions, demolitions, flying debris and bullets while the rest get destroyed.This movie is more suited to anyone under the age of 15.","Apr 1, 2023",4,/10
"OK, I've read a few reviews and I have to say I don't agree with the people flaming this movie. Its a movie about robots, for crying out loud, giant robots that turn into cars and planes. This isn't Shakespeare and it sure ain't no kidnapped child/sister whatever drama nor a political thriller. Its robots with lasers, rockets and they burn rubber. I admit its a bit confusing towards the end, but otherwise its plain fantastic. The story has a few gaps, sure, but that's not why we watch the Transformers. And yes, there's the unnecessary love story with an all too predictable ending and there's the stereotypic black guy comic relief and the genius hot hacker blond and so on. But when the autobots start rolling, its awesome :)","Jun 29, 2007",10,/10
"The title says it all. Gonna watch it 5 times and in a record 3 times in 4 days. I like the storyline and the flow of the movie plus the funny/joke parts is fresh.Glad to see almost my favourite Autobots and Decepticons appeared in the movie. Hope to see more Autobots and Decepticons in the next movie plus Dinobots and Destructicons.The battle scene are awesome and marvelous. The battle is intriguing and suspend. Full of energy and action. What can you expect from a great director, great executive producer and great special effect expertise? The greatest movie of all time that can be remember as long as you live.Hope Michael Bay will continue to direct this movie for 3,4 Transformers movie.","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"Hey all, I saw a screening last night of Transformers and let me just firstly say that at the end of the screening, one person started cheering then the whole cinema followed, not 10 people, not 20, but at least 100-200 people cheering the movie. Finally it seems a movie has come along and delivered on people's expectations, and exceeded them.Its the action scenes that really stand out, they are hard hitting and visceral, we know Michael Bay loves his action, but here they fit the Transformers perfectly. Lots and lots of things get smashed and destroyed and its exciting. Perhaps more so than any other action film for a very very long time. The CGI in this movie will win them an Academy Award, every scene just reeks of thousands and thousands of dollars spent - and thats a good thing.The storyline blends in really well, the whole movie is like one long roller-coaster ride and it never slows down. Anyone concerned this is a movie for nerds and geeks who like their geeky toys can rest assured that the movie will transform you within 15-20 minutes in. By the end you WILL be a fan.I think people will be genuinely surprised by what Michael Bay has done here. For me personally The Rock was an action masterpiece and Transformers is right up there.","Jun 29, 2007",10,/10
"By my estimation, 40% of the humor in Transformers is comprised of racial stereotypes, flatulence, pee jokes, disrespect to with the intent to hurt women, drug use, and masturbation jokes. Real classy. Since the screenwriters of Transformers are the same bigots hired to script the new Star Trek, is anyone else as horrified as me? The ""future"" doesn't look good. I'm sure we'll hear these pinheads on the DVD commentary regaling us with comparisons to ancient mythology and the like, flouting whatever frivolous degrees led them into their lucrative film careers... writing chihuahua gags. That's right, if you thought small animal gags were held in reserve for Ben Stiller comedies, you were wrong. They can also enhance major science fiction epics. Because traditionally, cult fan bases love when their favorite universes are seasoned with fart and pee pee jokes, because it gives them a sense of pride. Pride that a major studio didn't have enough confidence in a 23 year-old property with a built-in worldwide audience guaranteed to shatter box office records that they made a movie not for us thirtysomethings who made Transformers a commodity in the first place, but moreso for eight year-olds. That's gratitude for you.I thought Shia LaBeouf was supposed to be this wunderkind up-and-coming. Maybe that's apparent in Disturbia, which I missed, because in Transformers he's a total ham.","Aug 29, 2007",3,/10
"This film I was completely skeptical about. It has dazzling visual effects but was that the only thing that it had going for it? The answer to that is no my friends. This film beats out the other blockbuster hits or busts in my case such as Spider-Man 3, POTC 3, and Shrek The Third. It appears that this summer had so much promise with the movies above that I was in a downfall. After seeing Ratatouille hopes were back up and after watching this film ""Transformers"" I feel satisfied.The film starts off with a alien, metal like cube with engravings all around it. A voice over kicks in of Optimus Prime explaining in detail but brief, the magnitude of the All Spark. Needless to say it is powerful and that the Decepticons want to retrieve it for complete domination and the Autobots plan to destroy it so that the Decepticons don't succeed with their plan. The All Spark reaches the planet earth remain hidden in a secret military base which is discovered later on in the movie. No worries it's not a spoiler.Now we are introduced to Shia's character Sam Witwicky. Junior year at high school who is your typical average male. He wants the car and the girl. Same predicament I am in. Noice! He obviously gets the car, I mean it would be pointless if he didn't then the story wouldn't further. What's great about Sam seems to get in these unusual situations where it includes some humiliation on his part but non-intentional. I will talk about the dialog later on. Sam represents the average typical male with delight. He is a character that everyone loves and cheers for when the epic battle between the Autobots and Decepticons occurs. Supporting role is Megan Fox who plays Mikaela Banes. First off, you have to be a fox if your last name is Fox. Well golly gee, Megan Fox is definitely eye candy for the male community. At first I wasn't too sure of her role for the movie. As the movie continued on I realized her purpose was to fuel Sam's character for motivation. Since Sam is very intrigued by Mikaela, his inability to impress her is ""rescued"" by his car who is named Bumble Bee. One of the best things about this film is that the cars, especially Bumble Bee, is treated with respect. Despite the problems it supposedly possessed Sam always believed in the car making him even more likable. Back to Mikalea what is great about her she is not the typical damsel in distress. She was able to carry her own weight around without being too needy and annoying. As you may notice there is Josh Duhamel as Captain Lennox and Tyrese Gibson as USAF Tech Sergeant Epps. Surprisingly Tyrese was able to keep his shirt on. Character wise, he was someone who could of lived or died and the story wouldn't change one bit. Epps was more of a supporting character for Lennox. I liked Duhamel character's more due to he had a wife and kid appearing to be a great husband who looks forward to spend time with his new born daughter.Since Shia is in this film you know he was going to execute the dialog in a enthusiastic and sarcastic manner. The delivery and the emphasis was well thought. Sometimes a movie has those one liners where you cringe and go that wasn't needed. Robert Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and John Rogers were able to avoid that. None the less Shia has come a long way since his debut on Even Stevens. He was able to execute the dialog in a suitable manner making that moment enjoyable whether content, disappointed, intrigued etc.This movie provides a great score provided by composer Steve Jablonsky. He also did the blockbuster bust The Island which by the way is one of personal favorite movies. It busted due to bad marketing. Jablonsky was able to capture the moment of the film with his thumping moledious feel. Aside from the score, the film included various bands such as Disturbed, Smashing Pumpkins and Linkin Park giving it a edgy feel.One thing that my friend Ryan pointed out that the negative aspect of this film is the camera work. I know it's an action flick but you wanted the camera to stop shaking or take a breather to get a still shot. Otherwise the film was completely entertaining.Another thing that I am proud of, Transformers could easily entered the cheesy territory and it was able to avoid that. Thank you!!!!! However there were moments that bordered the line but quickly disappeared.You don't have to be a long time Transformer enthusiast. I watched the shows, but it's not one of my favorites. It is something worth checking out. One more thing, ILM has set a higher standards of visual effects.Very enjoyable, fun, entertaining. The characters were great. The story worked for me. Transformers is worth watching! 2 1/2 hours, kept me engaged the whole time. Michael Bay has achieved victory!","Jul 6, 2007",9,/10
"Lets start at the top ; this is not a good movie. The storyline is inconsistent , the genre is vague , the scenes are not well tied together, dogs follow the kid, dogs disappear, kid loses his pants, and they are back on him again , soldiers take a cube that holds the fate of the world to take it to a safe place, and they also take two childs to come with,for absolutely no reason , a kid is fast enough to outrun a f-16like plane, but not smart enough to think that getting in a chopper when there are flying robots around is not a good idea,some girl is stupid enough to follow,not escape from, evil robots,vs. vs..But it was Transformers. it was what i watched for all my childhood, come to life! it was so much fun to watch them transform , move and talk (but not fight,the battle scenes are awful,sadly:()it was really funny to watch Sam go through all those things,it was cool to see megatron,and stuff..the battle scenes were really disappointing. except the one that prime kills another robot with his sword, you cant really understand who is attacking who,who does what,and things like that.scenes are too fast and camera never stops shaking,so all you see is metal clashing and shaking.this was the real disappointment.the rest doesn't matter because it is not a deep movie,it doesn't try to be,so a consistent storyline and stuff like that aren't really important;the goal is to see a car becoming a robot and talk.well, the comedy was too exaggerated ; they try to make you laugh at almost every scene,and when they try to be sad,they fail miserably..still,it was Transformers.it is a great choice for anyone who ever loved the cartoons and for people who are just looking for a plain fun&funny,mindless entertainment.","Jul 8, 2007",5,/10

He does a great job in this movie and there isn't a single time i think he isn't into it.The Special Fx are amazing, the Transformers look great, all of them, the fighting scenes are a blast to watch.The Story is pretty simple, stop Megatron from receiving the cube or all hell will break loose and we all die.

"Without a doubt the best Sci Fi in the last 10 years. I case your wondering, I have thought about the Star Wars Prequels and War of the Worlds. Honestly, this beats them both.For starters it breaks away from this standard of making fictional, comic book-like colorful character from being too psychological. The director is basically saying, forget these standards, I'm making a movie about non-human characters, the best way to make this movie is by creating a fun movie about robots smashing each other. He keeps the plot simply and straight-to-the point, as it should be.The screen-play kept you hooked. It presents such daily issued that almost anybody can relate with and merges it the transformers movie. We have the military and leadership perspective, the scientific perspective and the regular people perspective that is balance to the point of keeping our adrenaline pumping and have several laughs along the way. This is a breather from the all too serious Star Wars and, to mention Comic Book, Spiderman. Especially with Star Wars, you felt like it was a soap opera. Transformers is very true to the human reactions to the events; people running away, military and intelligence people trying to figure out was is wrong. Or even before the fighting starts, we say regular people living their regular lives and acting according to their backgrounds. Granted, the humor placed on it is a bit exaggerated, but no more exaggerated than the negative human reactions in Star Wars, which were way over the top.What prevented it from being a perfect movie was that it over extended its ""increasing conflict"" and the lack of more action scene. Adding a few more robots, starting the battles quicker and extending them a bit would have made it truly exceptional. My advise to Michael Bay on this is not to be shy to make bigger Sci Fi movies. He has what it takes to make the big and great.","Jul 5, 2007",9,/10
"I grew up playing with Transformers as a kid. I had no idea if I would love this movie, or hate it, because I had no idea if I would connect with it, now as a 30 something big kid who remembers well playing with the toys and watching the cartoons.I totally loved it. A friend of mine, who saw it before I did, told me, ""I won't spoil it for you, but I'll tell you this: it's everything you hope it is."" And it is.The ""characters"" (and I'm talking the non-human ones, here) match exactly with the ""personalities"" you're expecting. The effects are amazing -- they really do fit seamlessly into the action, without detracting. Overall, it's just a thoroughly satisfying movie. And that's from a 30-something ""girl"" whose brothers always made her play with Bumblebee. ;)","Jul 17, 2007",10,/10
"One of the most boring pictures of all time. Devoid of all the magic of the original transformers. The adolescent love story doesn't add nothing to the picture, and the decepticons are stripped of all their charm...Megatron is a brute with no intelligence, and many of the autobots scenes are plain ridiculous. Even the little details that we loved were cut from this movie, example the sound of transforming...a classic! But no, it didn't make the big screen. The music is horrible too.The picture is confuse all the time and the robots scenes, specially the fighting were the most boring mecha scenes of all time. They should have learned from the Japanese something.If you like transformers, get the eigthies animated movie, that one rocks!","Nov 23, 2008",2,/10

"I went to movie with a lot of expectations, first because of the trailer, a very good trailer and then because I really like the idea of Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg being the executive producers. This movie is well directed and with amazing effects (maybe the best special effects in a movie!) but have a fews problems. First the good points: -Well directed, with something that I like a lot, the camera never stops - Shia LaBeouf is great in the movie, without the movie would be just an animation movieAmazing special effects, maybe the best ever in a movieA great entertaining movie, I really didn't felt that I was in the cinema for 2h and 24 minutesNow the Bad points:I hated the music, Linkin Park??? It really didn't fit in the movieSome jokes were really bad and I was a little embarrassedSometimes the story doesn't seemed very convincing ( I know that it is Transformers but it could have been better)Well, let's say that is a good summer movie and if you like Independence Day and Armageddon you will like the movie!

"TRANSFORMERS**** stars out of 5 (8/10).I tend to like or dislike Michael Bay's films, more often for the latter. His latest movie, ""Transformers"", is a big success. It is funny and thoroughly entertaining.Sam Witwicky (SHIA LABEOUF) is an isolated teenager who buys an old camaro with the help of his father. In fact, the car is a transformer, here with his comrades to save the human race from destruction. There are evil transformers (forgive me die hard fans, I don't recall the name) who are trying to steal a cube that helps form planets. Instead of using it for good, they plan on using it to dominate the earth and create a planet more fit for themselves. The Autobots (the good guys) understand the human viewpoint and want to help. All the while, the government tries to figure out what is going on, and determines how to stop the machines.In the end credits, the movie says it's based on the action figures. I'm sure they borrowed from the old t.v. show as well, but I'd never thought this would happen; being blown out of my seat at a movie inspired by toys. By my plot description above, the movie doesn't sound funny at all. Let me tell you something; it's hilarious. The audience and I were cracking up for about two hours. In fact, it is one of the movie's strongest points. The sharp writing and the quick delivery makes it all the better. Even the transformers are able to crack one-liners and it's all a whole lot of fun.Shia LaBeouf is in top form here, as he was in ""Disturbia"". The beautiful MEGAN FOX gets the job done as Mikaela Banes, the school babe who is more than meets the eye. The other standouts would be ANTHONY ANDERSON and JOHN TURTURRO who give us two more hilarious performances. JOHN VOIGHT is worth recommending, because he hardly delivers a mediocre role. This movie is non-stop entertainment. The action scenes are exciting and well-directed. The amount of effort that had to go in this film must be staggering. The CGI is beyond stunning, and the film reaches a certain level of art.The movie has a few teen romance clichés, and the end climax is too long and can be overwhelming. The giant robots deliver cheesy lines about how they're going to dominate each other. Nonetheless, it is well-shot and very fun. That's what this film is; fun. There's not much else to it.

"My main problem with this mess of a film is What exactly was the point in making it? I grew up with Transformers and was absolutely in love with the cartoons. This however is the phantom menace of transformers. Terrible high speed cgi that is so fast and confusing you cant actually see what is going on for most of the film. every robot looks EXACTLY the same except for Prime and Bumblebee. The dialogue is even worse!!! The majority of the cinema was laughing throughout the continuous cringe worthy talk of ""e bay"", which was unexpected as i wasn't even aware the film was meant to be a comedy! I knew somehow Michael Bay would make a disaster of this Hollywood exploitation but hey, at least he's a little bit richer so he must be happy. It seems a lot of people really rate this film, but if like me you just sensed how bad it was gonna be, its no surprise!","Aug 27, 2007",3,/10
"The movie had good action. The history of how transformers came to be is introduced in the beginning for all those who are unfamiliar with the story which helps everyone understand what's going on. Some parts at the beginning could have been cut out. The movie was about 3 or so hours long- too long. Some of the content was a little too mature for children under 7 years old. The action scenes near the end were too jiggly. You would get a headache if you kept your eyes open for all the fight scenes. Great graphics of the transformers matched in with the real actors. And, there is a good storyline which helps keep the audiences attention until the end. The is definitely room for a sequel. And, I'm sure toy makers will be making numerous toys for children of all ages to have their very own transformer. It pays to go see it (better than a rent-able)! Enjoy!","Jul 8, 2007",8,/10

"...no, not really. I can't back that up. But I will say, that this was one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a long time. And it was the first of the huge summer blockbusters that did not disappoint me (except for Die Hard 4 - also great fun).I expected nothing more from Transformers than to have fun and be blown away - which I did and I was :-) This was far superior to this summer's threequels - Spidey and Pirates, that I found to be very dull and unimaginative.And by far Michael Bay's finest film. Oh, and Labeouf rules! So thanks Bay and Spielberg!","Jul 19, 2007",10,/10
"Transformers looks like it is going to be one of the biggest successes of the summer, and it is easy to see why. While this film won't go down as a great cinematic masterpiece, it will go down as one of the best films in a summer full of useless garbage. I have read quite a few of the negative reviews of this movie, and I can't really understand them. People complain about poor acting, a paper thin plot, and general cheesiness. I just want to ask what they expected from a summer blockbuster popcorn flick. It is based on a 1980s cartoon show for crying out loud. I have to say, I liked the movie. There was a lot of action, the acting wasn't as bad as it could have been, and the special effects were jaw dropping. It is eye candy, designed to get people to to theater, and it worked well. It isn't Citizen Kane, and it doesn't pretend to be. It is a nice film, that doesn't preach too much, promises lots of excitement and action, and manages to deliver. It helped get my mind off of the fact that where I am living is dull, I don't know anyone, and my wife is only 2 months into a 15 month deployment.The only thing I hope is that the studio doesn't get stupid and work on pumping out a really lousy sequel. Hopefully, this summer has convinced studios not to go down that road any more.","Jul 8, 2007",8,/10
"my mates and i were so pumped to see this movie. one of my mates actually kept looking on a website that had a timer countdown for the release.the three of us showed up 20 minutes before the cinema even opened and we were the first three to get tickets for the first screening in that cinema. the lights dimmed and we were going crazy it was awesome! we absolutely fell in love with this movie. one mate saw it about 6 or 7 times in the cinemas.the acting really was great. Shia LaBeouf is a very talented actor and one i have occasionally seen rising up through his acting career. he is very funny in a quirky way and just a great actor. i cannot picture anybody else as Sam 'Spike' Witwicky.Megan Fox was just hot and is a fairly decent actor herself. seeing Jon Voight was just cool and he is a good actor. my mate being a fan of Las Vegas couldn't wait to see Josh Duhamel in this movie and he is also a very talented actor.there are quite a lot of funny parts in this movie. like some of the stuff that Frenzy gets up to. some of the things the Autobots say and do and of course Shia.pointing out comedians Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson in this movie i reckon just added to how great this movie was. Rachael Taylor was pretty good but i think she exaggerated her Australian accent a little, we don't all sound that bad. hehe.the convincing CGI used for the Transformers just blew us away. so convincing, so realistic. even so far as having light and other objects reflecting off their metallic surfaces.the music score is a masterpiece. it is very good. i wasn't sure orchestral music would work, but it did very amazing.this movie is just so jam packed with action its awesome. i mean come on, who doesn't want to see giant robots shooting and beating each other and the environment up? the movie doesn't focus massively on character development, which most people see as a flaw, but i found enough to be there it was great.","Jun 10, 2008",10,/10

Michael bay needs a mega-tron to keep him at bay, someone who has the power to suppress his naive and evil prowess. someone needs to limit his powers by law to ensure that the creative minds of the past and future can create magical stories and characters without their creations being totally spoiled, rained on and ruined by a simple madman who has no idea of story, dialogs or retaining the heart of a story. a story and brand in this case that has survived decades only to be stomped on by Michael bays idiotic and uneducated cgi machine heads.

Everyone has to analyze the script or the sound or what Michael should of done with that scene or what he should of done with that scene. Given the chance, none of you would know the first thing to do in a Michael's place.I thought this movie was a lot of fun. It's called fantasy. This wouldn't happen in real life. This is from the imagination of a couple of writers and from a comic book for crying out loud.Just go see this movie with a little less Hollywood crap and just see it for what it is. 100 or so minutes of people running around and robots changing into cars and planes and beating the crap out of each other and stuff getting blown up. That's it - period.Also, Shia LeBouf is truly funny in this movie. He makes this entire movie. It's hard to act like there are changeable robots coming at you. You have to really know how to act, when there is nothing there to react too. Fun.","Dec 31, 2007",8,/10
"It is hard to put into words what this movie is. At first the movie starts out making you think it is going to be some childish kids movie, but almost 1 min in you realize there is a lot more to be had here. This movie was Michael Bay's best yet. It combines the sick special effects with hilarious commentary and characters you fall in love with. Despite all my friend's saying Shia LaBeouf is a terrible actor in regards to ""Holes"", his performance was amazing. He made people laugh. I also thought some of the military aspects of the movie were impressive, some of the weapons and aircraft they used are not even in military production yet. The fight jets used for example. This movie had everything, from bad ass army officials to hot Megan Fox. This movie is worth seeing more than once. It ain't a stupid robot film by any means. This film has a lot ""more than meets the eye"".","Aug 27, 2007",9,/10
"Before i begin my review, i wanna state that Michael Bay is one my favourite directors despite knowing how many people hate him. I always felt he is the right man for s studio to hire to make a perfect blockbuster movie, but sadly he never quite directed the right kind of subject to find that perfect mix between storytelling and special effects. I have grown up watching Hollywood all my life and Michael Bay's movies always give me that escapist excitement that i seek from larger than life movies.This film is big screen entertainment at it's breathtaking best and will leave you exhausted at the end of the show. This is no way a kids movie. Its got action, action and more action.Plenty of humor, A very human story (its cheesy, but you wont care). Right from the first frame the film will grip you and never let you loose, its an unforgettable movie experience.I would not like to go into much of the movie details because no adjective will do justice to it.It needs to be seen and felt.

"As a young teen in 1984 I was a major fan of Transformers. So, when I learned it was coming out as a movie I was psyched, but worried that movie makers would screw it up and leave it unrecognizable.I was there opening night, with my kids, ready for anything. What I saw on the screen was quintessential Transformers and I was Pleased. Even though it was updated to reflect the 12st Century, this was the Transformers I knew.I would have liked to see more character development for the Transformers, and less for the humans. Much of the Transformers characterizations relied on knowledge of and referred to the original cartoon, such as Megatron's seemingly non-sequitor comment to Starscream regarding Starscream's repeated failures.The good side to this is that for fans of the original Transformers, there were many references to the cartoon. The nature of the Transformers arrival was changed, as was their reason for being on Earth.Transformers is NOT a movie for kids. I saw at least one mom taking her child (age 5?) out of the theater after repeated ""colorful"" language and violence, including many graphic scenes of human death, and overt sexual innuendo. Even the cartoon of the 80s was rather dark, one of the few cartoons where characters, human and Transformer, actually died in battle.","Jul 5, 2007",9,/10
"The story written for this movie is so moronic. As a child who grew up on the original animated classic TV show ""The Transformers"" - this film doesn't even come close that show. I don't know why the hell they let Michael Bay direct this movie, I am ashamed that Steven Spielberg took credit for producing this movie - although - in Production terms this movie is good. The CGI graphics are not so impressive in design terms - the made the robots more biological and liquid. This movie looks like the bastard child of created by Terminator 2 and Independence Day.

"WOW. This movie cannot be described in words. You cant explain how perfect this movie is. How the hell did it only get 7.5/10. I do not understand. The action was out of this world. The effects were amazing. The Script and story was creative and brilliant. And the actors were perfectly chosen. There's the perfect amount of everything in this movie. Romance, Comedy, Action, Thriller, and the list goes on and on. Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox connect on screen very well and the transformers effects look so real, you could have fooled me. Michael Bay brings his best and succeeds. Everything just goes so well together.Best movie in a long time. See this if you have not or your missing out!","Oct 16, 2008",10,/10
"Just face the facts, this movie was made for the fans. We wanted to see robots transform in the real world and they did. No big script to follow, just make sure they transform and talk. Also to have the same voice for Optimus Prime was just another great thing for the fans. The rest just followed the cartoon format and it worked. I would watch it on a TV series if they made one. The fact that they could take any vehicle and make it transform gives me the feeling we will see this happen again maybe on TV or a sequel. And to comment on people who say they didn't have a story line, well do you watch a ball game for a story line or the action and excitement?","Jul 17, 2007",10,/10
"Transformers is fun, entertaining and worth watching. You might read some other reviews that slam the movie for being more of a Sci-Fi-action-comedy rather than a pure Sci-Fi flick. Transformers was never a sci-fi series to begin with, but rather a vehicle (no pun intended) to sell merchandise. The hardcore fan might not like this film because it does poke fun at it's self, which gives it great character. We are talking about robots that can transform into cars, planes and other machines. The real science is pretty much out the window so no need to be a hardcore geek about it - It's not a Carl Sagan novel.If your in the mood to be entertained for a couple of hours this movie delivers. Special effects are the best on most complex I have seen. The characters are fun and you really get to like the main human character.As for the Transformers themselves the film makers kept their campy dialog from the animated 80's series. Also the robots have a personality and comes across pretty well, especially bumble bee. If your a hardcore Trans-nerd avoid this movie. If your a general movie goer than go watch it.","Jul 8, 2007",9,/10

"It's almost a buddy movie AND a war movie. There's the bigger story of the war, and there's also the smaller story with the guy, the girl and Bumblebee going on at the same time. The Transformers are all alien robots that possess the ability to scan any other machine and then turn themselves into a copy of it. Usually they tend to add the Autobot or Decepticon symbol somewhere. The Decepticons, at least, also have the ability to produce a holographic representation of a human sitting inside them. The main difference between the Autobots and Decepticons seems to be political; the Autobots refuse to harm humans, whereas the Decepticons want to destroy us all. All of them seem to have learned English and other information about Earth from the Internet.In the smaller story, Bublebee is a teenager's first car. Bumblebee seems almost over-enthusiastic in trying to help the kid get laid. The girl is hot. Picture ""Herbie"" meets ""American Pie"". (Well, maybe not American Pie, they don't go that far, but one of those movies)The kid and Bublebee were also being pursued by a police car with the Decepticon symbol on the side. This part of the story reminded me a bit of Terminator T but much bigger and more menacing.One of the great things about this movie, which surprised even me, is that they actually managed to make the Decepticons scary and creepy. Particularly the Helicopter and Soundwave (I think it was Soundwave. The only remotely Soundwave-like thing about it was that it took the form of a DVD player, and Soundwave was a tape player.)Soundwave is a much smaller Decepticon than the others. He seems to be acting basically as a spy. He's this little, almost gremlin-like creature, constantly sneaking around and hiding when humans might see him. He's roughly 30 or 50 cm tall at his full height, whereas the others average 5, 10 meters tall. I won't tell you too much about Megatron.COMPLAINTS; Unlike the cartoon, their design seems to be over-complicated, they seem to break into too many small parts when they transform. Almost as if they were trying too hard to make it look different from a toy. This creates two main problems; A) it makes it allot more difficult to follow or figure out how they transform, which is exactly what was so interesting about Transformers back in the 80's B) It also makes their faces too complicated, which means it's hard to tell them apart. Particularly the Decepticons.In some of the action sequences towards the end, they used shaky cameras and dust just to make it look more ""real"". In fact it just looks shaky. Cinema Varitae is vastly over-rated.","Jul 15, 2007",9,/10

"I have never seen a movie like this, if you are slightly intrigued, go see it! I was incredibly apprehensive of Michael Bay directing this film after such garbage as Pearl Harbour, and I've not been overly impressed with most his work.After Transformers it becomes Clear that Michael Bay is perhaps the new James Cameron as far as action is concerned. I still however dislike the dialogue and a lot of the acting he directs, if only he had a co-director.The Transformers are completely epic, they are stunning, the CG is the best i have seen. They are huge transforming robots but he has made them look more powerful than i would guess most could. They have been made with a human element so that we are much more involved and concerned with the outcome of the fights.I am starving for more, and i can easily put up with average plot development, and average acting for a second viewing.A favourite, simply because of the robots!!!","Aug 17, 2007",8,/10
"And the summary is put VERY NICE.I'm not a Michael Bay fan, though I think The Rock is one hell of a piece of nice Actionmovie and I really enjoyed Bad Boys. Mostly his movies are brainless but full of actionsequences that are nice to watch on the silver screen.Not so with TRANSFORMERS. The Script was a rag rug put into existence in such loveless ways that your brain just had to kick back in and produce all those thoughts revolving around the word BAD. Everything on the storyside made the impression of a not well thought out shortmovie script. On the Acting and (actor-)directing side ... All of us know Michael Bay is not great in directing actors ... but in this movie he proofs HOW bad he can be and how much even the best actors depend on a good director ... if they don't get one ... you get TRANFORMERS.So ... what about the Action? The strong side of Michael Bay ... not much to impress here either. There are some VERY NICE Action scenes (very nice, not mind-numbing, what it should have been) with a lot of stuff getting blown up ... so often ... this seems absolute senseless and 20 to 30 percent of the actionscenes ... are just ... LAME ... because you don't see whats happening ... in those scenes you seem to see a big Ball of Trash shot in close-ups and with too much of a ""shaky-cam"" so you're constantly asking yourself: ""whats happening here? who's fighting who?""I went into TRANSFORMERS expecting a bad movie storysided and no acting at all, but with nice action that's worth the 8 dollars for my ticket. It was not. They should put all the GOOD actionscenes together in one reel, than that would be watchable ... yet THIS movie ... in the cinema ... is not.","Aug 4, 2007",3,/10

"Transformer became a common lingo in commercials for a few months even before the movie got released. Transformation visuals from the movie were viewed in great awe across the world. This movie has sure tried to transform the world in some way and has kind of succeeded in doing so. The question remains Will there be a sequel? Most say no but some say yes there will be.... well forget about the sequel now. So what makes this movie successful. Many different points:* it has been hyped and it has been one of the most expected movies of the year, * It did meet some expectation of the hype,* It has great visuals,* It has its own funny moments and human characters are not the only ones to give a emotional touch for the movie,* It was not boring and has a good theme. Well there are some people who may not like it, some say it looked as if the movie was a motor commercial but hey no one can deny the fact that they looked cool when they transformed into Autobots.If you are going to watch this movie then I would suggest watch it on a theater and not on a DVD to fully enjoy it.","Jul 11, 2007",8,/10
"OK I really liked this film, its a lot of fun that combines action and humor to the maximum level of extreme. Shia Lebeouf does a good job as the neighborhood kid who buys a car that turns out to be an alien robot. The action is really well shot and the graphics are out of this world. The freeway car chase scene and the city battle towards the end of the movie is really amazing and actually looks like its really happening in front of our everyday normal people, its amazing. Overall I give this an 8 out of 10 because the action is unbelievable and the humor is actually quite funny too. I would recommend this to all action fans and to all fans of Michael Bay who enjoyed his other films such as Bad Boys 1 & 2 and The Island. If you love action, see Transformers!!!","Oct 29, 2007",8,/10
"They have all that money and great special effects and no imagination! Maybe they were going for the Transformer fan. Obviously not for the sci-fi or fantasy fan.They even threw in a few cute factors. After I saw the first one, I almost left the theater. I was thinking, ""You've have got to be kidding me."" Cute is one thing, but the tooth fairy bit, that was lame. I think Spielberg has been hanging around Lucas too much.Seriously. Find a ""writer"" next time. This was obviously written by marketing. If it weren't for the cast and special effects, it wouldn't have been worth my time and money. This movie's story/plot is like water in a sieve. Perhaps the Transformer fans could see the Transformer story bits, but that is all there was. They tried adding other alien urban legend type of references, but it didn't help. In fact very contrived.Perhaps a different director would've worked, unless this one's hands were tied. Then I would feel sorry for him.How about throwing some of that money at us creative filmmakers?? Vive Le indie!!","Jul 7, 2007",4,/10
I thought this was brilliant. I was a bit apprehensive at first after watching the trailer and wondering whether i should watch this. I have not been disappointed. The script was brilliant and fitted in well with the actors playing their roles well. With Michael Bay bringing what he does best with great special effects and jaw dropping action. For this summer with all the big action films coming out like live free and die hard and the past pirates of the Caribbean 3. I have to say this has been my favourite with action all the way through to keep you wanting to know at the end who wins and who loses. Go to the cinema and see for yourself.

"Here is my four point plan for understanding this piece of sh*t movie: 1. Some studio actually chose Michael Bay to direct Transformers, like that was their best idea. 2. Shia LeBeouf is the lead. When people tell me Shia LeBeouf is good at acting, I've found that these same persons also don't watch very many movies. Its like if all the food you ever ate had rat feces in it, you might assume that food with rat feces in it is perfectly acceptable, but you would be wrong. 3. The humor of this movie is like that of a wealthy rapist,who by virtue of his vast wealth is able to evade any and all legal repercussions for his many rapes. 4. Its a movie about a cartoon series about talking cars that transform into robot-men from outer space. The cartoon existed solely to sell toys. It was an absurd show kept relevant by nostalgia alone. So when Transformers is turned into a live action movie its not filmed as an absurd satire, but rather as a serious action movie. A sad self-important bore featuring a dead-eyed Megan Fox, way to go everybody!","Mar 26, 2014",1,/10
"This movie is simply amazing. It is entertaining, fun, and the special effects are mind-blowing, even for this age when people take them for granted in every movie.Of course, all the critics would find many reasons why this film would be bad. They always do that. Regardless, people like it, and that is the main thing. Unlike some other animation/comics-based films, Transformers actually leave the old shell behind and focuses more on making a good entertainment rather than satisfying the die-hard fan's desires for boxy, classic characters. The pacing and editing is also unusual for this kind of movies, resulting in a very realistic environment.Shia LaBoeuf is simply great as the main character, and stands out the most, whilst Megan Fox, playing the role of protagonist's dream girl, is only trying to look hot instead of acting, sometimes making me wonder if anybody would notice the difference if a poster would be put in her place with voice-over. Her lines are pathetic, but a good (or any) actor talent should have dealt with that. She just doesn't have it.Overall, a great entertainment. I was very satisfied. This wouldn't have worked without Michael Bay, which made the movie into something more than one would expect from just hearing the name. 9.5/10","Jul 5, 2007",10,/10

"The moment I laid my eyes on the first episode of Transformers I was hooked! When it was on TV I watched it! It wasn't just a kids show! There were a lot of story lines that were quite compelling and contained very adult themes! (I remember that arch enemies Optimus Prime and Megatron even sometimes teamed up together in order to counter a bigger threat! The classic battle between good and evil wasn't always clear cut! Very interesting to watch!) Me and some friends of mine always hoped that they would make a Transformer movie! When the news came that this movie was going to be made I was full of joy! But I also feared that Hollywood would ruin everything that was so great about the Transformers franchise! With great relief I can mention that Michael Bay has captured the spirit of the Transformers and has made an excellent adaptation! The Transformers have a prominent role in the movie! They looked real and felt real! Even the human cast were good! Shia Laboeuf again manages to steal some serious screen presence like he did in ""Disturbia""! Although I hated the idea that human characters would be involved in the movie (Which in the cartoon was very minimal) they did add something extra! Escpecially in the humor department! Some scenes were just hilarious! But like the cartoon it is all about the Autobots and the Decepticons! Their battles is what we want to see and we get to see plenty of that! ""Transformers"" is without a doubt one of the best blockbusters movies from this year! It delivers on the action front and is pure fun! Go see it!","Jul 17, 2007",8,/10
"It's literally been decades since I saw the last episode of the transformers on TV. I remember the fun and excitement I felt as a kid when the autobots transformed. I expected an action-packed movie, a war between robots with explosions, car chases and a high tempo. I was very disappointed by the result. The movie resembles a teen summer movie more than an action flick, where the dorky kid (played very well by Shia LaBeouf) falls for the pretty girl. The transformers seem like the background to this story line for the first half of the movie. It's like we gone back in time to see mid 80s Disney movies. Later the transformers start fighting. The FX are very cool but sparse, the text isn't cool at all. Optimus Prime is an avid advocate of the humans right for freedom, holier than the pope. Very tacky and distasteful. The heroics of the young kids and soldiers are not believable. John Turturro does a good job, but that's not enough. Count me out for the sequel.","Jul 22, 2007",3,/10
"yes, i saw transformers today it was an excellent movie ah, it was so crazy suspenseful so many chase scenes, and how could there not be? the kids ARE being chased by robots planning to destroy the human race, anyway & it was also very funny : D for example, When Sam (Shia LaBeouf {which means 'The Beef' in french, no lie}) needs a new car, his father drives past a Porshe dealership; ""I've got a little surprise for you, son."" ""No, no, no, no! Dad! Oh, you've got to be kidding me!"" ""Yeah, I am. You're not getting a Porsche!"" oh man, funny stuff :D & everything the mother does is just so quirky ""We could call it Sam's Happy Time!"" it's great, probably one of the best movies coming out this summer but i gotta say, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry MIGHT beat it (I'm joking) but yeah, it's great. a little fast in action scenes, but i can forgive themonce more, GO SEE IT!","Jul 8, 2007",8,/10
"This is my first review on IMDb, because I have never felt so bad after watching a movie.Just some facts because you will probably see it no matter how bad it is (that's what the producers are thinking too): This is NOT Transformers, this is ugly robots (really ugly), with the ability to transform.There is NO plot, or should I say senseless plot to keep it objective?There ARE masturbation and pissing, yeah that's right, in a Transformers movie!

"It was quite a surprise watching Transformers evolve to such a good flick. I was of the opinion that apart from Quentin Tarantino no other director can successfully make a good movie based on junk topics. But Michael Bay overcomes the odds. Sure he needed a movie loaded with out of the world special effects, but still it was indeed a good movie nonetheless.It didn't have any big names on the screen. Just numerous robots, good and evil fighting for the world. Surprisingly, however odd this sounds, Michael Bay promoted the story just superbly. Not too much unrealistic, and neither a shade too realism. He had a great visual effects team working with him. Along with teenage beauties Megan Fox & Rachael Taylor, and Shia LaBeouf. He had Jon Voight on a nominal role plus Anthony Anderson as the funny man.The movie features some unbelievable action sequences amongst the Autobots and the Decepticons. The story is indeed junk. But the movie lives on the action sequences and the visual effects, which are literally out of this world.An unbelievable 8/10 !!!","Sep 15, 2007",8,/10
"""Transformers"" is everything I expected it to be: funny, silly, technically spectacular and... juvenile.If you expect this movie to be anything other than a hot-rodded Saturday morning cartoon, then this movie is not for you. Mostly Transformers is loosely tied, effortlessly predictable, stereotypical and has no real sense of a story line. The characters and actors merely ride along with us in our chairs as the action roars by.The whole point of Transformers though is to be a great Saturday morning cartoon, and Michael Bay has the flare to do it well.

That's all the plot summary you need.After an insane prologue where a US base is wiped out by a crazed robot - that sneaked in in the guise of a military helicopter - Bay proceeds with the unexpectedly touching story of young Sam (Shia LaBouf, one of the film's greatest assets) getting his first car (Autobot Bumblebee in disguise), unaware that both robot factions are monitoring him, his family having ties to a mystical lost cube they are searching for. A bit of time is spent exploring Sam's life and tentative romance with school hottie Michaela (Megan Fox, generic model-actress) before everything turns increasingly violent as the Autobots show up and make their purpose known and the Decepticons give up ""the subtle approach"" in favor of total carnage.Anyone showing up to see this film is in it for the spectacle and ""Transformers"" delivers. That ILM have accomplished miracles is an understatement: the character design and animation is bewildering, giving us something we've never seen before while seamlessly blending it with non-CGI elements. Each revamped robots is both amazing and affecting (particularly the touching Bumblebee and a gleefully bad-ass Megatron). Bay has his faults but when it comes to lightheaded entertainment and action, he is hard to beat, and here he outdoes himself it what could well be his finest film. The funny moments work thanks to Bay's breezy direction and Shia LaBouf's astounding likability, making the dramatic and epic bits all the more effective.That the film's ending seems a bit rushed and leaves you wanting more is a testament to how gripping the preceding 140 minutes have been, and you will leave the theater thinking of indelible scenes like Sam ""hiding"" Optimus Prime and company in his parents' backyard (a wonderfully absurd moment), the almost poetic arrival of the Autobots, and of course the final smack-down.The only similar event movie that comes to mind is the original Jurassic Park. You don't often hear yourself wishing for this, but ""Roll on the sequels, please!""","Jul 25, 2007",9,/10
"This movie is a Decepticon plot! It's so subversive with it's military violence, and extreme loud explosive sounds, and blurry action scenes that I had to leave the theater because of the intensity of the events shown on screen, and the way to loud volume of the explosions and gunfire. The plot is simple, as are the main characters. Yes, the special effects are sometimes awesome, but they only occur in about 15 to 20 minutes of the total 2 hour and twenty minute movie! There are a few good laughs, and jokes. The usual battle between good and evil/ heaven and hell/ angels versus devils is depicted. The GM product placement in this film will not save GM! Little children don't buy cars! The theater was half filled with kids. I'd give this movie a 6, but because of the overly high ratings others have given it, I'll only give it a 3 to help to offset the overall ridiculous high average rating!I fear for the entire populations hearing after suffering through this overly loud movie. The next time, I'll take ear plugs! geesh!","Jul 4, 2007",3,/10

"I went to see Transformers on opening night with a group of friends. I went in expecting a lot of action, some cool looking transforming robots, and of course Megan Fox. The movie delivered exactly that, and to my surprise, a little more. The special effects are unlike anything I have ever seen. Industrial Light & Magic should be handed their visual effects Oscar right now - the competition is probably over.However, several of my friends were disappointed with the movie. They claimed that the acting wasn't great and neither was the storyline. I thought, ""What were you expecting?"" While their gripes were mostly true - the acting isn't anything spectacular, clichés were abound, and there are a few unnecessary scenes that could have been edited out to cut down on the film's long run time - I didn't care. I loved all of it because it was fun as hell. Robots morphing into fighters jets and back again in mid-air, a tiny CD-player robot that later turns into a cell phone, Megatron and Optimus Prime beating on each other, smashing through buildings and jumping across rooftops. It's really a spectacle, and that really isn't ALL that the movie delivers.Shia LaBeouf is excellent again, returning from Disturbia-mode with the same awkward teenager humor. I thought he was hilarious - check out the scene when he talks to Megan Fox for the first time as he gives her a ride in his new car. John Turturro's appearance halfway through the film was a warm welcome. He shows his oddball side to good effect. Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson's small parts were hilarious; par for them. And I can't talk about the actors without mentioned Megan Fox. It sure as hell doesn't hurt a movie like this to have one of the hottest females on the planet appearing in most of the scenes.All in all, despite its shortcomings, Transformers packs enough of a punch with its incredible special effects and several diamond-in-the-rough non-action scenes that it will live on as a classic, especially if the two reported sequels can match its flare.","Jul 4, 2007",9,/10
"You can tell that each scene is a crafted work of art. The sound, the directing, and graphics are all fine tuned on each frame. I am VERY picky about movies looking fake and I have a very good eye for detail and I can assure you this movie will live up to and beat your every expectation. The micromanagement of detail is so well done the film looks very clean and not fragmented. The trash talking that the robots do while fighting does not sound boring or blah, its actually funny and entertaining. If I had to choose a few things that I would change about the movie it would be the mood, i would make it more serious and less funny but that could be just me. Also the S7 actor was an over actor and was kind of annoying at times but died off just in time to watch the end fight.","Jul 5, 2007",10,/10
"If you're a Transformers fan, then you'll love this movie no matter what anyone says. However, if you're a former fan who decided to ""grow up"" a bit then you might feel a little disappointed. Incredible special effects are mixed with an average plot (however it would be hard to make talking robots from space any more sensible) plus horrible dialogue and acting. Jon Voight and John Turturro are either big-time fans of these Hasbro babies or they lacked cash at the time of making. Shia Leboeuf (or what's his name) and Megan Fox are not even allowed to call themselves actors.Harsh judgment? Perhaps...or maybe it's just the truth.This review might be a little biased on my behalf, simply because I don't like the ""childrens' comedy"" and ""hardcore action"" mash'em-up.","Sep 27, 2007",4,/10
"Rarely does a film come along that you can watch again and again and never get bored. My friends didn't want to go see Transformers as they labelled it a 'Boys film'. I had never watched the original series as i wasn't born until 1992. Why this film didn't win the 3 Oscars ill never no. The acting was superb especially Shia Labeouf as he had to carry the role of the lead human. The CGI was fantastic it looked like the robots were actually there, and the last battle scene looked like it actually destroyed the city. It was funny in parts, my two favourite characters by far are Sam Witcwickys parents by far, the way they react to things is simply hilarious. The one liners were hilarious mostly delivered by Shia La Beouf 'I bought a car, turned out to be an alien robot...who knew?Well all i have to say is bring on Transformers 2 and 3 one of the best films on 2007 by far and in my top ten10/10","Jun 7, 2008",10,/10
"THE GOOD Nice effects, sometimes fun action (although overused to the brim, making it kinda less effective).THE BAD And Americans ask how come (everyone else) think Americans are arrogant? This movie skillfully capsulates what the American propaganda tradition does in popular culture. Americans are (as always in these movies) brave and good sports (especially between ethnicity!), they are competent, all girls look like photo-models, the nice guy always gets the photo-model at the end (fulfilling his dream). The American dream is painted over every frame until you get sick.And of course the Americans save the day.Conclusion: Story way to predictable, movie made strictly ""by the Hollywood book"" (even so more then for example ""indipendance day""). Its simply not very fun or exciting at all. This is like ""300"" but better made technically, which only gets the vote up slightly. Side-stories are corny and characters are veery stereotype. Feels like I've seen this movie before many times...And my girlfriend is American so I'm not just anti-American by default, but this movie is just too dumb to score any higher.Erik","Oct 16, 2007",3,/10
"When I walked out of the movie theater, I was at first disappointed. Deep down, I wanted Transformers to be a great movie, an epic on the same scale as LOTR or Star Wars. The dumb plot, the classic Michael Bay cheese, the brazen product placement all offended my cinema sensibilities. But the movie did bring back old memories, and made me reflect on why I loved the transformers cartoons (G1) in the first place.What was the cartoon like? It was a show for kids, and well, the plot and ""acting"" were accessories to the daily struggles of Autobots vs. Decepticons. It gets worse: The entire show was created so Hasbro could sell toys. Even the greatest moment in Transformer history, Optimus' death, was motivated by Hasbro's desire to sell a new toyline; It was one giant product placement. Toss artistic integrity out the window right there. So why do so many of us love Transformers? Simple: there is nothing cooler than giant transforming robots fighting evil. And that is exactly what Michael Bay gave us. Say what you want, but Bay is one of the finest directors of action sequences. All of the films flaws, all of them, where forgiven the moment Bumblebee transformed. I couldn't help but enjoy myself as I watched old friends fight familiar battles in stunning CG glory.Thank you Michael Bay, for letting me relive the joy I once experienced as a kid.","Jul 5, 2007",8,/10
"I haven't watched such an amazing movie ! It grabbed me from the beginning ! If I had a chance , I would shake the hands of all the crew who made ""Transfomers"" ! Everybody will wait a second part from ""Transformers"" and it will be a huge success ! And i will want to play a leading role there :D :) Just amazing ! I want to meet the actors to thank them for the beautiful and super cool movie ! It's effects , actors and everything is just perfect ! If someone who starred in the movie reads this , may he drop me a line ? :) Michael Bay did a great movie ! I've watched it 10-15 times and it's still very interesting for me ! Rating 10 / 10 :) :) :)","Jul 18, 2007",10,/10
"For me this movie started off as one of the best I have ever seen. The action was non-stop and the story and acting was good too. The humor did set it apart from normal action movies. Though I'm giving in 9/10 as the action did slow down at the point where the Autobots are introduced and meet Sam. Though again the action again picked up and was brilliant right to the end.A few scenes did remind me of Armageddon that Michael Bay directed earlier. That movie is one of my favorites too. I liked the small reference when during an action scene the young boy with the camcorder says,""Man this is 100 times cooler than Armageddon""! Shia LeBeouf is definitely one to watch for the future. After his Disturbia here is another fine performance.All in all, recommended highly!","Jul 8, 2007",9,/10
"Why does a film supposedly about giant, warring robots spend literally 2/3rds of its time following around a dozen boring, nameless humans?Why are there two metric tons of ""plot"" (read: frustratingly unfocused dialog mostly involving things unrelated to giant, warring robots) standing between the viewer and every decent action scene? This is bloody >>Transformers<< not Days of our Lives. Make with the intergalactic robot battles already.Sorry, but after the ridiculously awesome introduction I was all charged up for action-film history. Instead the movie stops... dead... for over an hour, while minute after long minute is spend developing countless characters who all somehow still come off as one-note and hollow.Toss in a painfully lame slapstick sequence set in the main character's back yard (I don't buy the ""it's a kid's movie"" defense. Nobody young enough to think that scene is funny would have made it past the brutal introduction without bursting into tears.) and you've got a disappointing mess of a Blockbuster.I recommend borrowing the DVD from your friend, watching the opening Middle East sequence, then hitting ""stop"" and going to do something else.","Jan 12, 2008",3,/10

"This film is based on a series of cartoons that were released 20 years ago. Therefore this was a risky thing for Bay to take on due to all the old fans of it that he could disappoint.Although the transformers cartoon series wasn't in my time, i still watched a few of my brothers old videos of it and began to enjoy it. Due to this fact i can safely say that this film was a significant disappointment.The film focuses too much onto the lives on the humans rather then the robots. The characters are poorly developed and are in turn, are clichéd and crude. Shia labeouf's character (sam) is a typical American teenager who happens to be chucked into the story. Sam is alongside another flop of a character played by Megan Fox. She plays a blunt and pointless and character who is only there for eye candy (although i don't mind). Much like other Bay films, the army characters are big tough guys who will kill and shoot everything in sight. There's even a cheesy sub-plot for one of the soldiers of him wanting to go home and hug is new-born child. The character's have been hand-picked from pearl harbour and American pie and chucked into a cage with some big machines. This doesn't work.As for the story, well the lack of story. the story is about a war between the autobots and the decepticons about capturing a cube which holds the ultimate power. The whole of mankind is at stake. the story is very poor and is very unfaithful to the cartoon.Michael Bay is the king of americanising films and this is what hes done to the transformers series. Hes threw in some slow motion, unfunny humour and boy loves girl into one film thats meant to be a sci-fi thriller.This is not a sci-fi thriller like its supposed to be, its a teen flick with some robots in it.I've said a lot of bad about the film but i give it 3/10, why? Well i thought that the visuals and cinematography were at times breathtaking and intense. The fight scenes were fantastic and they were in my opinion the only good scenes of the film.While this film is watchable, the flurry of cliché's and the extremely unoriginal storyline and characterisation were simply too much for me to really enjoy this film. Bay brought a fantastic idea to mediocrity.We're bombarded with stylish visuals but there's a serious lack of originality3/10","Jan 27, 2008",3,/10
"Transformers... When you think of Transformers, i think big robots fighting for no reason. After this movie, the only thing you can think of is Transformers. A very good start, where Michael Bay shows this movie has a very gentle humour and he's not only the king of action, but also of teenage love twists. Good actors, awesome effects and hit story. Nothing more to add. But the only reason that i wouldn't give a ten on this one is because Michael Bay gives to much of everything. The movie doesn't feel serious to make the fans thrilled, to much humour, you don't get a grip on the movie.But a very good job by Michael Bay tho.","Jul 6, 2007",8,/10
"This movie had it all! It was great! And for anyone who didn't like it, they're just haters with no taste. But there was nothing to hate about it, it had action, comic relief, lots of crisis, and a little sprinkle of drama. Everyone I know loved this movie. Some have even gone to go see it again which is rare. It is like the old transformers but with some upgrades. The transformers look a lot better, more sleek and up to date. Shia is a great actor and he does deliver in this flick like all the others. The fight scenes are intense and action-packed. Oh, and I did not think it would be possible with this kind of movie, but I actually cried a bit. The cars, and well all the vehicles are really nice too, especially the main one, you'll see.","Jul 27, 2007",10,/10
"I saw it and I was in awe at the end. I CANOT WAIT FOR 2009!!!! I heard a Transformers 2 is coming out then. Only thing I didn't like, was the fact that Jazz died. But the word around the grapevine is that Bay's gotten so much 'Angst-mail' that he's been given no choice but to bring Jazz back somehow. There were so many plot-holes that really, a Transformers 2 is actually necessary. And to those who think it was a bad movie, well, that's your freedom of speech, but I have mine as well and I say that you obviously DID NOT see the same movie I did. This was hands down, THE best movie I have ever seen. It had a bit of everything in it. Comedy, horror, action, romance, EVERYTHING. I think, though, Optimus Prime was COLD to Jazz after he had died. He said two words! And that was it. No feeling at all. But still, THE BEST MOVIE EVER! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SEEING IT! DVD COMES OUT 10/16/07","Oct 15, 2007",10,/10
"Basically, the special effects were awesome. I could not get enough of the way the robots transformed. That was the high point. The low points are the story, dialog, and acting----they were terrible. The dialog was just stupid. The love interest of the main character was pretty but just a filler and was placed in this movie so that juvenile boys could go crazy over, which is not a bad thing if she had some decent script to work with and if she had the ability to act. Both of which I did not see.If I was not a fan of Transformers already, I would have given this movie a 1. If you want to check out a good Transformer series, then go rent Beast Wars or the old Transformer animation. The latter though is dated since it came out during the 1980's.","Aug 4, 2007",2,/10
"Well the last poster really hated it 3/10 not good at all really. I gave myself an open mind to be honest.I am a massive fan of the original cartoons and I thought, I won't let that affect my views, its gonna be different.I read all the reviews prior to the film and thought, oh no this is gonna suck! I watched it and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. True enough Megatron would have been in bits if they had used his tech to reverse engineer stuff, but who cares, just for once, can people not just watch a film for the sake of watching a film. The fact that this film has 8.2/10 on IMDb and most films have like 6/10 even the best of them to be fair, sort of tells you something.","Jul 9, 2007",8,/10
"It's been a long time that I have actually had to agree with critics. This movie was just another Michael Bay film. I even told myself that this was going to be just a good action film before I went in but it wasn't even that. I didn't need more action. I needed better story telling.You had this hot girl that knew everything about cars. You had another hot girl that knew everything about computers and defense. You have your typical young weird nerdy guys that know more than the old nerdy guys. You have a bunch of models playing the military roles. You have pointless stunt scenes that just don't make any sense. The camera shakes all over the place because you don't know how to use a camera.The only things good I can say about this movie are The Robots were cool and Shia Labuff was great as Bumble Bee's Driver. Other than that I wasn't very impressed with the way the story was told. This movie though cheesy could have been so much better. Autobots, Roll out of this movie. Get rid of Michael Bay.","Jul 8, 2007",4,/10

"I thought the trailer for this looked great, but dear-oh-dear, this film is such a pile of nonsense. The first 40 mins build-up were OK, although endless wise-cracks do not make for great dialogue. But after that it all goes down the toilet! I've come to the conclusion that films like this are a major reason why people out-with the US dislike America so much: every world disaster centres around the USA; Every teen in the USA has a vocabulary almost entirely consisting of the words ""bro"", ""dude"" and ""awesome"" (and the complete script for this garbage could have been written by an American teenager); the American military are in some ways competent and well-prepared at dealing with crises (patently not so); Americans are uniquely brave in adversity (again a lie). This film is more cynical than any WWF wrestling smack-down you could imagine. Don't get me wrong, I love the States and many people there but none of the folk I know would endorse this crap. Come on people, rise above this rubbish. I saw another corny film this weekend - ""Pursuit of Happiness"" - it wasn't brilliant and again, it sugared the American Dream, but at least it had someone who can act a bit (Will Smith) and it also had some heart and soul - this had none. Sheesh, this film makes Con-Air look like Citizen Kane. Avoid at all costs.","Jul 29, 2007",3,/10
"To make this story short, good alien robots and bad alien robots crash on earth to find a cube. One wants to destroy it, the other wants total domination.When you go into a Michael Bay film you can expect 2 things to happen. One, balls to the wall action, involving car chases, shoot outs and explosions. Two, characters that have no arc what so ever and we don't really seem to care about them. Such is the case with Transformers. The only difference is, this film is based on a television/toy from the same name, so it's fan base knows the characters and feels attached to them anyway. You can now add Transformers to the list of films that have been transfered from either: Television show, video game, toy, and comic. Unlike 80 percent of films based on these things, Transformers is actually good. This is a big statement, this is the same guy that took a historic moment in American history and turned it into some sappy bad love story. He's back on his game, when he did The Rock.The die hard fans of Transformers will point out it's flaws from the get go, these so called flaws do not affect the film one bit. In fact it helps, the fact that they changed it to fit any kind of reality in film. Do we really want to see Megatron transform into a giant gun, and do the colours of Optimus Prime really matter on the semi? Fans complained that there was no white spider on the suit of Black Spiderman and there's no exception here either.Don't be afraid to see the film if you have no idea about the characters previously. It's simple, blue eyes are good, red eyes are bad. They look like normal machines, but transform into giant robots. I myself never watched the show, I did watch Beast Wars though, a spin off series in which they would transform into pre-historic animal on earth, instead of cars. The main reason to be seeing this film, is to watch some badass robots blowing stuff up trying to kill each other, while destroying the city we live in. This is accomplished, but we also have to be sidetracked through boring non-important sub-plot involving humans.There are two characters that could have been completely cut out, or transformed, no pun intended, into one character. This could have saved time, time that could have been added to what the people want to see, giant robots. The two characters in question are Anthony Anderson and Rachael Taylor. Here are two people, for other then some comic relief and tech mumbo-jumbo serve no purpose to the advancement of the story. Does she really need a guy whose better at the stuff then she is? Why can she simply be the best and do whatever it is he does? Secondly, there is another subplot the is mentioned but never explored. Megan Fox's characters father has a record and this is used against her...for 2 minutes, then it gets cleared, one scene of drama between two characters, then it's pushed away never to be seen again. These things fall under the one of the two expected things to happen at a BAY film.The other, the action, is in full swing. You'll get goose bumps when you first see them transform, then again when they are in action, destroying the city around them. Everything is so well created that one can actually believe this is happening in the city. I can see some awards thrown this way for special effects. In a time when people have seen spidermen swings through cities, pirates sailing the seas and hobbits roaming to a mountain, it takes something special to be able to make the audience drop their jaws in awe. This film does that.Even though there are plot holes, such as where did Barricade go after he led the other Decepticons into battle in the city? What happened to the x-box, steering wheel and pop machine after they transformed? How does someone as hot as Megan Fox end up with the kid from Even Stevens? Things we will never know. The film has a few surprising faces that pop up. The voice of Agent Smith makes an appearance as the head bad guy, John Turturro, John Voight, Bernie Mac, Zack Ward pop up here and there. I was expecting to see Steve Buscemi be some kind of comic relief guy, but to my disappointment.Transformers has a few steps it misses on that ladder to greatness. A long running time, missing plot holes and character we couldn't care for round up the most of it. I'm sure there are other things, but we go to see this film for one thing. Giant Robots In Action. That my friend is what it delivers, it a breathtaking final scene within the city. Jets fly through buildings, tanks fire left right and centre, crazy is not even a way to describe it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a popcorn movie, that is really really loud.","Oct 27, 2007",8,/10
**WARNING MAY CONTAIN Spoilers** im a big transformers fan and one of the best movies ever is the original transformers the movie but not this one this one is crap. so i start watching it thinking this is going to be bad ass film how i was wrong. i was hoping for the same story from the g1 cartoons but no we get a story about the all-spark a cube which cerated cybertron which messes with the transformers mythology because in the g1 cartoons the quintisons cerated cybertron and the transformers. but back to the filmthe first thing i will say is that kids will love this but transformers fans will not.we don't get much robot action for the first 45 Min's then it picks up to fighting which was cool but it was to short.there are not much decipticons in the film and when there is they look like faceless giant robots which brings me to my next complaint.the transformers i know had colourful bodies and block heads which was cool in this one they look like a mass of scaffolding formed together to make a robot.the film was also confusing it did not explain stuff like is the cd player soundwave.take your kids to see it you wont be disappointed but transformers fans keep away from this heap of crap,"Aug 4, 2007",3,/10
"hmitt said that the Transformer sound is missing from the movie. It's there, but perhaps I only heard it after reading the comment that said it wasn't their. I think perhaps you only hear it when they transform in slow motion? Magic movie, the transformations are what I would have loved to have seen in the toys. I always thought that the toys were just too simple, and you never saw the detail in the cartoons. There is one scene where a human and girl are standing in the middle of the auto-bots and they all transform in turn, spine chilling! Starscream's transformation is the best, a couple of times he jumps into the air and almost back-flips while transforming.I loved this, as did my 8 year old son (""what's a transformer?"").","Jul 1, 2007",9,/10

"The girl is hot, Shia Lebeuf is irritating, the soldier boys are completely undeveloped characters. The action is ever present, but in typical Michael Bay form it is full of flash and little substance, as well as too many discontinuities to count. Michael Bay is without a doubt the WORST big name director in Hollywood. Is it too much to ask for an action movie with a story and character development? If you like action, sure, you have to see this. Spend as little as possible to do it, this is a candy coated pile of poo and the center is of the runny variety...Since this has to have enough lines of text, I'll tell you about a movie you should see...

By the time you see the last episode, you'll be utterly amazed that this show got canceled without all the episodes even being aired. There's action, there's romance, there's comedy.

(except Shia and Turturro who is obviously overdoing it and having a lot of fun)Dialogues suck. But hey.. It's not an Academy award contender, and it's not written by Charlie Kauffman.. IT'S FUNNY!Story sucks... but once again... compared to the cartoon story.. it holds out pretty well...Too many characters... true... sooo true... some totally unnecessary (sp?) but hey... it's a MICHAEL BAY MOVIE!!! it's his trademark!CGI? Eye popping eye candy!Action? superb (and for the people who say that there wasn't enough robot rough'n'tumble... just think of the costs!!!!)Music and sound effects? perfect!Product placement? Well, someone had to pay for the perfect CGI and effects...All in all...A perfect ten for a movie that wasn't aiming to be smart, serious and boring, but a turn-off-your-mind-and-enjoy-the-show movie.Fun, pretty, loud and hilarious! Perfect!","Jul 14, 2007",10,/10

i kinda think your wrong.. cos .. its one of the best movies I've ever seen in my lifethe way the story unfolds is so tastefully done... the actors are new... so give them some slack.. at least they met the par performance wise..and the parts that stalled for the main event to begin were surprisingly good... it was fairly humorous and Michael Bay did one hell of a good job putting this togetherthe robots however i agree that they should have talked more and also during the fight but this movie is VERY GOOD!!and thats pretty much all i have to say,"Jul 16, 2007",10,/10

"I've never been a big fan of CG in movies; I feel it totally ruined ""the magic,"" but this movie blends it almost perfectly with live-action that throughout most of the movie, I felt as if the Robots were like any other actors! There were a few times when ""the cursed CG monster"" reared its ugly bright head, but very minimally; the Transformations were looked great, and the CG characters actually looked like they interacted with the real actors. Peter Cullen reprised his voice acting for Optimus Prime, not a spoiler, and proved he was, is, and always will be, the man behind Prime! Shia LaBeuf, or however you spell it, is at the top of his game as Sam Witwicky too, and Megan Fox is simply electrifying as Mikaela. There was one part I didn't like though, this may be a spoiler for some sad people out there like myself, Prime has lips. In short, minimal cussing, lots of really top notch CGI goodness, no female nudity, grade A performances from the immediate cast, and tolerable cheesiness, make TF a good bet for the summertime theater crowds! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!","Jul 7, 2007",9,/10
"Yes, only two words sum it all up: ""Freakin' awesome!"" Or so that's what a five year-old told me after we saw it last night at the Tuesday release.Growing up on Transformers and other 80's cartoons (and comics, toys), this was well worth the wait. Micheal Bay delivers like expected: high-octane action that gets you from the beginning and doesn't let you go until the very last scene. (The theatre was packed full of children--and after ten minutes, NO ONE was talking or leaving their seats. Unheard of.) The detail on the Transformers has already been laid on so thick by other reviews--and that's because not enough can be said about it! The robots are almost obsessively detailed, which makes them extremely realistic, and makes you think that this really could happen. Even die-hard fans will find the upgrades on the Transformers themselves believable, understandable, and mind-blowing.There has been criticism about the camera play and grainy, incoherent battle scenes, but I found them realistic and cohesive--especially when you're a puny human trying to watch two 20-30 foot robots destroy each other. Perspective makes it harder to believe, and to see. Bay makes the camera angles very realistic by showing us what we would see if we were are ground zero.And also, like said in previous reviews, the storyline was a bit on the weak side. Or at least not what you would be expecting from a movie called ""Transformers."" Humans played too large a part for a movie about alien robots. I'm sure they'll compensate for this in the rumored sequel--which I'm sure after this weekend won't be a rumor anymore.My biggest quirk with the storyline and dialogue was the rampant comedy--particularly the rather crude and childish wording and actions. (Bumblebee's lubrication of the Sector Seven guy, or Mom's ""private"" talk, anyone?) Shia LeBouf, renowned for his comedy, was more than enough to keep the laughs in the theatre without ""potty humor."" This was not a obscenely-budgeted film, but that did not effect the quality of the actors one iota. From Shia to Jon Voight, Bernie Mac and voice talents of Peter Cullen (who we fondly remember as the original Optimus Prime) and Hugo Weaving, the cast was solid and believable.The music score was outstanding. Steve Jablonsky, usually a composer for the horror-thriller genre, did a stand-up and recognizable job at keeping the music flowing and up with the action, making sure that there was never a dull moment. (I particularly liked the almost hymnal score piece while the Autobots were coming to Earth to Sam.) Linkin Park, Goo Goo Dolls, Disturbed and several other notables lended their talents to the score and to the soundtrack--I'm gonna put it on my must-have list.All-in-all, this is the blockbuster family movie that is a must-see for anyone who lived on Transformers as kid. Oh, and bring your kids, too.9/10","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10
"Best movie I've seen in a long time, First movie I've ever went back to the theater to see again, and considered going a third time.Let me also point out that I've scoured the internet reading all the bad reviews, for anyone reading these reviews Don't bother listening. The movie was great, Transformers managed to keep a good balance of drama, action, and comedy. Which kept me in my seat even though my kidneys were shutting down because I had to pee so bad. All the complaints I've seen on the internet can be easily dismissed. Since all complaints are the focus of 2 things, one people compare it to generation 1. I grew up with G1 I'm glad they changed things, the cartoon was dry, I've watched it again as an adult and if they brought that back to theaters which I was afraid of, the sales would have toped 37 dollars and a piece of lint. If you like G1. then watch the G1 movie. secondly the other complaint people have mad is that the movie is military propaganda, or a car advertisement. Of course the military would be involved in fighting giant invading evil robots. and the auto-bots are cars. what did you expect? the auto-bots don't even have GM symbols on them just the auto-bot insignia, and last time I checked the military hasn't ever had to fight of giant robots. the movie was great entertainment and there was never a time in the theater were I was left bored waiting on the movie to pick up again, also it was one of the few movies were everyone in the theater was laughing or clapping, and also got a round of applause at the end, this movie kills all the other recent flops, the sales speak for themselves, Go see it, you wont regret it. you will want to see it again.","Jul 9, 2007",9,/10
"After all the hype, ""Transformers"" came in with a bang and went out with silent sigh. I am sorry to say it was a very big disappointment. The effects were good but how often do you need to see them transform. It became quite repetitive for my taste. Acting? The seasoned actors (Anthony Anderson, Jon Voight, John Tuturro et. al) did a good job but the ingénues remained ingénues in the excitement of their actions (DeBeouf and debunked and the touch of prettiness. Megan Fox).I guess any Transformer fan might have got their rocks off being familiar with the figures, voices and story line but for us foreign to this all, I can imagine had the same reaction as myself - what another waste in talent and money and my time!","Aug 16, 2007",2,/10

"This last year has been kind of blah for movies. Shrek 3 was pathetic for starters. Spider-Man 3 is FLAWLESS in every way!!! Transformers is AWESOME!!! I've never been a fan of Transformers growing up, but, this movie ROCKED!!! Second to Spider-Man 3, of course. No film for 2007 beats Spider-Man 3!! The action in Transformers is NON STOP!!! I'm not joking, it's constant. The Transformer's look SO real, I can't even tell that they are CGI, (Same with Spider-Man.) The storyline is easy to follow. The acting is good (all except for Shia Labeouf.) I mean, he is NOT a good actor!! Ignore him, and this movie is great!!! I mean, the Transformer's (good and bad) are sooo entertaining that, I didn't even pay attention to any of the live actor's. (which, the acting wasn't very good. Shia Labeouf made a complete fool of himself.) But, with that aside, this film is PHENOMENAL!!! See this movie (after you see Spider-Man 3!!)","Jan 30, 2008",10,/10
"To be fair, ""Transformers"" is not a masterpiece. It will probably never be classified as ""culturally significant"" or win awards for anything other than visuals.And, at its heart, it is not much more than a 2 1/2 hour toy commercial.But here's the thing- It's not really trying to be anything else. Michael Bay, rather than try to deny the cheesy and somewhat ridiculous background of this project has chosen to fully embrace Transformers at the core and the results, believe it or not, are DAMN. GOOD.Breakthrough special effects are combined with Bay's trademark action sequences to bring the most beloved elements of our favorite toys to life at long last. Top it all off with Peter Cullen and you have a guaranteed blockbuster on your hands!!!!!","Jun 28, 2007",9,/10
"Frist of all the movie is really great , the directing ,the sound effects and finally the animation is above excellent except the story is not really perfect and also the scene of Qatar is Unrealistic. Qatar is very civilized and also the fastest growing country in the middle east after Dubai. And also Qatar Doesn't have mountains , well I live there I didn't see any mountains in my life and also another thing the houses are not built like shown in the movie. In Qatar, the houses are very luxurious! But every thing else is awesome, excellent, great whatever you call it .

"I was a huge Transformers fan as a child, so with the latest developments in CGI I was truly looking forward to this movie, until I realised that the man at the helm was Michael Bay. This is the man who unleashed Pearl Harbor, Armageddon and The Island upon an unsuspecting world, so I knew fear. I went into the cinema hoping that it would be good, but expecting it to be bad. In the end my expectations won and my hopes were shattered.Firstly, the good. The action is mind-blowing, there are some set pieces that truly make you gasp. The transforming sequences are beautifully done, and the robots are the most life-like CGI characters up to date. When we look back at the history of CGI and live-action, this film will be one of the true innovators, and its technological achievements are worthy to be mentioned in the same sentence with the likes of Jurassic Park and LOTR. Whenever the Transformers are on screen, the movie becomes something else. Those scenes are precisely what a Transformers movie should be all about: robots beating the daylights out of each other.However, the problem with this Transformers movie are the large chunks of time when the robots are not on screen. The acting is ludicrously bad, Bay manages to squeeze more emotion from Optimus Prime's little finger than from his entire human cast. John Turturro portrays the wacky black-ops operative, one of the many failed and feeble attempts at comic-relief, but he looks embarrassed by the script. Bernie Mac has become a movie cliché all on his own as the ""funny black man"", a cliché reprised poorly by Anthony Anderson, who is probably the worst ever hacker on screen. John Voight is clearly bored by playing yet another hapless authority figure. Oh yes, and we also get the ""little Arab kid"", Bay's scraping of the cliché barrel knows no boundaries.This is a movie clinically tailored for the male teenager. The female cast has been hired just to look pretty (which they do, with the exception of the adequately embarrassed mum). I do not know where the producers hang out, but female hackers do not look like Rachael Taylor. And don't even get me started on racial stereotypes. Blacks eat a lot, white suburbians only care about their lawns, Hispanics are superstitious and go into Spanish rants all the time.The dialogue is painful at times, and the supposedly comic scene where the protagonists look for the glasses while the Transformers wait outside has got to be one of the most contrived and ham-fisted scenes that I have had the displeasure of witnessing. I literally groaned at how completely parochial it all seemed. The world is threatened, yet we stand around talking about masturbation.This movie is a clear spawn of the post-911 genre. The military are given a bumped-up heroic role, which had the same lame effect in the overall result as it did in War of the Worlds. We are hit over the head time and time again with America's military superiority, but the fact that the Transformers are vulnerable to conventional weaponry completely steals the thunder from the heroic Autobots, who end up being nothing but large support cast. This is the main flaw in an already flawed film. The climax could have been the same if you had erased the Autobots, just let the marines handle things. Oh yes, where were the Decepticons in all this? Yet another wasted opportunity at complexity.This movie had a lot of potential, but unfortunately Bay and his ilk clearly do not think highly of their audience. They know what to give them, and seeing the comments in this board, they are always going to get a positive response regardless of the drivel they produce.","Jul 31, 2007",3,/10
"I thought it was fantastic, I haven't had a better time at a movie since 300. I was a HUGE transformers fan when I was a kid...had a closet completely full of them back in the 80's. I thought it kept the same feeling as the old cartoons. At some points in the movie it made you go WHOA that was wild, other parts you laughed, each of the Transformers had their own personalities just like in the old cartoons, I can't find a thing wrong with it. You ridiculous film critics that always have something bad to say about a damn good film astound me. Everyone has their own views so I guess I'll leave it at that, but don't nit-pick at every damn detail as if it destroyed the entire movie. For those of you that haven't seen it, go see it, it's a damn good movie. :)","Jul 5, 2007",10,/10
"The three stars I give this movie are only and solely for CGI and great transformation scenes. This is really the greatest real movie adaptation of the animated series transformations I could imagine... I am almost tempted to up the stars now...But... and that is a big ""but""... whenever humans intrude, the movie becomes embarrassing, unrealistic (ok, transforming cars are not realistic, but I would have expected a more serious reenactment of family life) and, frankly, boring. Whoever played the Witwicky guy is so... bland... he's not even funny and the girl - she might be a good actress if only the camera didn't reduce her to her boo... err, good looks.And what in h... was that garden-wrecking scene about? Why is that Autobot complaining about ""rodents""??? What does an alien life-form know about rodents anyway? Vermin, as a general term, maybe, but ""rodents""??? Uh... and ""stop lubricating the human""??? WTF??? Fun in a movie is okay, but this was LAME!!! I left the theater before the movie ended, sorry. Maybe I will rent the DVD some day, but not too soon. For the time being, I will watch the old animated series. .. and have real fun.","Sep 18, 2007",3,/10
"A generation has grown and introduced it's favorite 'robots in disguise' to the next generation.Director Micheal Bay gave us such summer family films as ""Armaggedon"", ""The Rock"", and ""Bad Boys"". Here he turns his attention to lovingly updating a childhood classic that earned only moderate acclaim in it's own time.Don't get me wrong, I was one of the kids that have followed the evolution of the Autobots and Decepticons as well as the Insecticons and the Constructicons and whatever those silly human-sized robots were.Even as an adult, I have an Autobot decal on the side of my car (that has been there two years) and am wearing the Transformers shirt I have owned for several years as well.So I approach the movie understanding many will have different interpretations on a fondly remembered favorite. Further, Bay had his doubts about helming what he perceived to be a children's movie.All this considered, you will approach the first half as a uniquely fun little romp as ""Sam"" contends with a car that seems to cause him nothing but trouble. As the movie progresses, a Bay-style gritty fight for survival emerges, pitting Decepticon metal against human mettle as a squad of elite soldiers join Sam and his newfound interest in holding off the red-eyed bad guys to help Optimus Prime and the Autobots. Their ensuing battle decimates a downtown.As a side-note, the product placement division was hard at work, but enticingly vague, leading you to think more subliminally about what you saw. Without divulging too much, a fleeting example involves a machine that shoots cans of soda. If we must endure placement, execs take heed, this is the way to do it.I value that some distribution exec somewhere saw fit to allow a preview of it to military theaters, but they would tear their hair out if could have anticipated even half of the abysmal screening conditions at the Ft Lewis movie theater;-the movie is stopped several seconds in so the projectionist could threaten the audience.-the second reel was loaded backwards and had to be stopped and reloaded.-the projector lens pops out more than once and needs to be refocused each time.-the light level seems to waver throughout the movie.While the screening conditions were deplorable, you cannot beat a military crowd and it's family for cheering and gasping at all the right places.Great news; James Earl Jones has been signed to voice and discussions are underway for a sequel in two years. For Transformers fans, this sensation is 'more than meets the eye'.","Jul 1, 2007",8,/10
"It's not a drama, nor an Oscar nominee. It's not about strong character development or captivating emotions.

John Turturro was the happy exception, he was actually allowed to steal a few scenes. overall - i expected so much more, even though i haven't read any of the comics, perhaps the comments of other viewers mislead me to believe there might be something more than flashy effects. i guess the pr people invaded IMDb.com as well =/ can hardly give more than 5/10, which is perhaps one of the lowest ratings i've given here on IMDbyou don't choose your viewers, the viewers choose you...peace","Sep 28, 2007",5,/10
"Transformers is one of those summer blockbuster movies that you can't miss. It was action packed and loads of fun. Sure the story was confusing and some of the actors only secondary to all the transforming alien robot clans, but it all seemed to work because the film never takes itself too seriously.Two alien robot clans land on Earth and do battle over an Allspark which is a magic cube of some kind which grants unlimited power to whoever possesses it. You have the heroic Autobots and their leader Optimus Prime, and then you have the evil Decepticons and their leader Megatron. I could go into more detail about how this Allspark ended up on earth, but it would take way too long. If you go and see the movie, it is explained in detail anyway, so I don't believe I need to explain it here.Anyway our main star in the film, outside the special effects and the robots, is none other then Shia Labeouf who was the lead man in the suspense thriller Disturbia which was out earlier this year. He plays Sam Witwicky, and like he did with Disturbia brings a lot of humor and wit to Transformers as well. His costar is the hot and sexy Megan Fox who becomes his love interest and also knows a thing or two about car engines. There is also support from big actors Jon Voight, John Torturro, and Tyrese Gibson as well as comic relief from Kevin Dunn and Julie White who play parents Ron and Judy Witwicky. What these other actors offer may not be great, but it helps to keep the movie from ever being just a one dimensional action packed thriller loaded with special effects and nothing else.The special effects are in fact the best I've ever seen. They even rival those of Spiderman 3, and may even go beyond that early summer blockbuster which I was disappointed with. Michael Bay keeps the action moving and only slows down in his attempts for humor which actually work. Bumblebee, the Camaro that Sam actually buys, is comic relief in itself as one of the Autobots which seems to play classic rock songs at just the right time to mirror what Sam is actually thinking.If you were a fan of the Transformer toys back in the 80s, I think you'll like the movie. Even if you weren't a fan, I still suggest you see the film because it is quite entertaining. I will give it an 8 out of 10.","Jul 9, 2007",8,/10
"Seriously, this is the dumbest movie I've ever tried to watch.I didn't even last an hour. Absolutely nothing in the film works: The humour falls flat every time.The action is boring.The story is unbelievable on every conceivable level.The acting is laughable.It makes Maximum Overdrive seem like Citizen Kane.Seriously, this film has *no* redeeming qualities whatsoever. Worst of all, it's absolutely drop-dead boring and predictable at every turn.Avoid at all costs.","Sep 25, 2009",1,/10
"Anyway, last night I saw Transformers in IMAX. If you have not seen it, please go. I was extremely pleasantly surprised.I was expecting your normal, boring, fighting movie that was generic, with big guys punching, kicking and shooting each other.However, this movie was different.For one, the acting was great. Shia LaBeouf put on a fairly good performance, and to be fair, the other actors were probably better than him overall, especially Jon Voight, who was splendid as the Secretary of Defense. The others were also great. They were smart, had good timing with their lines, great chemistry, overall just great acting.The scenes, also. They were splendid. Vivid fight scenes, twists and turns in the movie as well. You really get to feel for the robots as they fight; the Decepticons seem infinitely stronger. On IMAX, it looks even better.Another fact I loved; the military actually HELPED in a superhero movie. Usually, they just stand idly by and try to help but fail, but they actually played a major role in this movie. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson were expertly cast in this role.And perhaps the best part about this movie...It...was..FUNNY This movie was amazingly funny. And it wasn't all about comedy either. It picked its spots extremely well. The Autobots were extremely personable, especially Bumblebee (and I also happen to be a fan of Jazz, and Optimus Prime, of course as well). Anthony Anderson and Bernie Mac also made appearances, and played each of their roles very well.My only negative comment was that it was long and late at night, but that was fine with me.Overall, this movie was a SEVERE surprise. I loved it. Has anyone else seen it yet? It's been out for a while. I can't wait for the sequel.","Sep 30, 2007",10,/10
"This movie was, by a massive amount, the best movie I have seen so far this summer. Non-stop action and a plot that keeps you interested the entire movie.Shia LaBeouf seems to be surfacing in a TON of movies in the past few years. This kid can act! He plays his role in Tranformers especially well. I don't think they could have cast anyone better for the part. On another note about casting, props to whoever cast Megan Fox. I, along with most likely the entire male population on this planet, will be forever grateful. Hiring an actress who hasn't been in many movies was a smart move.I gave this movie a 10/10! A summer must-see! Bring the kids!","Jul 22, 2007",10,/10
"Transformers was a great movie, even though there were some changes made! I think they were necessary changes in order to make it seam real, credible, and believable! If they did not change the way it looked and felt (Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, etc.) and if it weren't for the other changes made, it would not have been as good and cool and it would have been too kiddish for the adults and fans of the Transformers Animated Series (including myself) who were kids then but are adults now!! Yes! They would have complained it was too kiddish and it feel or look realistic, credible, and believable! Oppinons are like @#!holes, everyone has one! People are way too critical! It is a movie and there is no perfect movie because there are no perfect people, and people make movies!! I think the movie had a lot of funny moments, it had action (Almost nonstop), the visual affects were GREAT, the voices were great, and the sound affects were great! I went to Best Buy to purchase the movie on the release day and you would think they were given the Tranformers DVDs away free the way people were buying them! It also did extremely well in the theaters! Only a good movie causes this sort of reaction with people, not a movie that is terrible!! They did the impossible, and they pulled it off!!

"There have been several movies that have changed my idea of thinking of the film business. King Kong and Lord of the Rings being some of them. Transformers is one of those movies, but for a different reason. When I saw the teaser trailer at Pirates of the Caribbean last year I laughed. The idea seemed absurd, but the finished product was spectacular. I not only was blown away by the action, but i was amazed at how awesome Michael Bay made a movie about a toy aimed for 8 year olds (sorry Transformers fans.) The humor was genuinely laughable. The characters (for the most part) were well written and the special effects were ground breaking. Transformers deserves its 8 out of ten. I want to give it higher but if it did i would be putting this movie with the likes of The Godfather or Return of the King and that just doesn't seem to fit.","Aug 21, 2007",8,/10

"""Transformers"" (2007) is the infamous sci-fi movie based on the beloved Hasbro robot characters. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Transformers is about a guy called Sam and his car, which turns out to be a robot involved in an interstellar war with other robots. The visual effects, battles and sound design are pretty and very impressive, however, that is also where the praise stops.Transformers suffer from a lot from objective issues. There is a lot of illogical plot elements, immature teenage humor, sensuality, and flat, stereotypical characters. Mixed with an uneven pacing where certain scenes are stretching way too long, there's a big risk for audiences to feel uninterested and frustrated. The movie is at times also confusing and unclear about exactly what is going on, and certain side characters can feel inhuman and very over-the-top. The more these points are vital to one's watching experience, the more the same watcher will identify to the previously mentioned audience. This movie is clearly aimed to the younger teenagers and can likewise be perceived as cool and thrilling if one is 12, 13, or maybe even 14.

"I have loved transformers since i was a kid and always wanted to see the autobots on the big screen. Thank God that modern technology has finally allowed it.Special effects were amazing, if i didn't know that those types of robots could never exist yet i would have thought i was watching a newsreel.Story line was great, not a ripoff of the cartoon, but an original story, so not even a ""based on"" film and the acting was great. Shia LaBeouf gave a great performance, and had an amazing way of relating with the effects.all in all The Best Film Ever","Jul 22, 2007",10,/10
"Wow, this movie just blew me away. I didn't have very high expectations but this just amazingly projected a stylistic vision of what is Transformers.Not an avid fan but I did see some of the cartoons growing up. It was cool cars and what not transforming, good versus evil, Optimus vs Megatron, it was all gravy. But never have I imagined such stunning visuals and an individualistic adaptation so intense, just purely entertaining as it is impressive.From a viewers opinion, I wouldn't really convey the fact of some slight changes to the originals rather accept the fact that this is one of the few movies that amazes me in terms of visuals, plot and pace. Of course there's Megan Fox, who adds even more spice to the film.The only worry before watching this was the length and I'm relieved that it was just long enough to fit in all the necessary components to make it one hell of a movie. Michael Bay yet again stays true to his usual style of blowing up everything in sight but, no protest there its fun to watch. 10/10 watch it. No disappointments, except for the die hard fans who complain about the drastic changes.","Jul 21, 2007",10,/10
"They threw together every poor cliché in the book. So poorly written and directed. Boring, cringe-inducing scenes repeated over and over again.No sense of awe, wonderment or even teenage lust that needs to come with sci-fi thrillers.Megan Fox is pretty but not believable as Shia's romantic interest. Shia never really comes into his own.The government men are portrayed as completely inept. Lots of racist overtones/stereotypes of black people.A shiny new toy that's easily discarded in favor of the box it came in.","Mar 24, 2015",1,/10
"Being a fan of the series, I was a bit skeptical how they would pull this off, but I have to say I was surprised and very happy. Working at Paramount I was lucky enough to get a viewing before the release and thought the movie was very good. Kept me hooked throughout.The only thing stopping it from being perfect is the cheesy dialog towards the end but other than that incredible. Battle scenes are awesome, transformers look incredible and story is entertaining. The characters fit in perfectly with their blend of humor and quirks. The good thing is they never take away anything from the Transformers. And the special effects are top notch. Go see the movie. Best movie of the summer by far!","Jun 29, 2007",9,/10
"Ten years ago, Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay kick started what would eventually become one of the most financially successful and bombastically dumb summer franchises in film history. So putting aside any thoughts or premonitions about the function of this fiasco, it's worth looking back and asking how the original Transformers bodes as movie.In the first hour, Bay succeeds in summoning some laughs out of Shia LaBoeff and his new car (the autobot Bumble-Bee in disguise). Keeping this a secret from his parents makes the hiding of ET look like a piece of cake. Enter Megan Fox, the potential love interest. When we meet her, she is inspecting a car engine, bent over it as if posing for a playboy cover. She goes through the movie with almost as little to do as she has to say; a reminder that the women in Michael Bay movies are objects. Bay's floating swirling camera work signifies everything that is simultaneously right and wrong about him; he is a exceptional pornographer. The focal point of his direction has always been making the shot look good. In terms of performance there is nothing wrong with the camera work, but ironically its perfection is distracting; as is the application of slow motion. LaBeoff has enough energy and tongue-in-cheek to make the first hour of the movie tolerable. Halfway in we meet Optimus Prime in all his chrome bodied glory, with the sombre godly voice of Peter Cullen. He gives a cue card explanation of his job and his enemy the Cybertrons. These moments may conger feeling of nostalgia for anyone who grew up on the 80's series. For the rest of us, Optimus' lecture makes you realize how cheesy an idea Transformers really is.Bay stages a loud numbing climax that is the film's greatest undoing. It starts with a punch that catapults an eighteen wheeler so beautifully that it would have been more thrilling to have seen the actually rigged effect on set. he may have a good eye for camera, but when it comes to editing he is virtually blind. The action takes place in the kind of dense metropolis where all the buildings are the same colour, and there is no sense of orientation. It feels as if every shot is only two frames in length, and at the speed of the unfolding chaos makes it impossible to distinguish the Autobots from the cybertrons. Perhaps more than anything else, Transformers' biggest problem is that is that the Transfomers themselves are nothing resembling characters. They have no feelings, and their dialog seems manufactured. Certain lines are exactly what you expect to hear when you press the button on the toy.","Jul 10, 2017",5,/10
"When I heard the rumors that Stephen Spielberg will bring this movie to live about 2 years ago, I held my expectation high, with the assumption that Spielberg himself will direct the movie. But my high expectation faded away when I watched the trailers, for seeing such un-neat creatures so called robots... Still, i waited the days to watch the movie with full enthusiasm...The movie was set slowly and carefully, in order for the audience to understand the background of the Transformers. For me, the various setting and places was quite confusing, creates long and complicated background...Overall, the story was amusing, fun and exciting, blended of comedy, action and sci-fi.... If you love Bad Boys and The Rock, now Michael Bay presents another breath taking action movie with a twist of alien robots...-turtle-","Jun 28, 2007",9,/10
"I was a Transformers kid. I loved the toys, the cartoons and even saw the original animated film on the day it was released in my home town in 1987.As I stood in line waiting to go into the theater last night (28-06-07)to see Transformers, I noticed how excited I was feeling. A few feet away, some guys were waxing on about all the things they assumed would be bad about the movie.This kind of saddened me, it was almost like they were waiting to see the movie fall flat on its face, or perhaps this cynicism was a defense mechanism. Were they were preparing themselves for the worst? We finally filed into the theater, and after nearly half an hour of commercials and promos, Tranformers finally began.The first thing that I have to say, is that this ""is"" a Michael Bay film. It has big action, it is populated with broad, shallow characters and has more than a few cringe worthy gags.But where this film rises above the excessive chaos of his previous films, is in the casting of Shia Lebuff who is both funny and believable. A lesser actor, really would have hamstrung this film. Shia grounds it with his wonderful, relatable performance.And then there are the Transformers themselves. A wonder to behold. The Autobots have made the transition from cartoon to big screen, with all of their courage and nobility intact. The thrill of seeing these compassionate, giant robots defending their human wards, stumbling through cultural differances and dealing with issues of scale filled me with a childlike happiness.These characters are more than special effects, and sound design. They really are amazing.I loved this movie, at it's worst moments it's dumb fun, at it's best it's like watching Jurassic Park for the first time all those years ago. I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing! Interestingly enough, the same trench coat wearing geeks, that were bagging the film as we went into the theater, whole heartedly stood and clapped as it finished.","Jun 28, 2007",9,/10

"As a child in the 80's, I know exactly why this movie sucks so much.. the first main reason is quite clear: they focused too much on humans instead to keep focus on the robots.. first biggest reason..I know popcorn movies like that ask for a hot girl and stuff.. but in this particular one, they should skip it.. if the point was to make a movie for younger audience so there is one more reason to keep it out.. otherwise, they only reason to put a hot girl in a movie like is making her show her boobs.. no boobs, no hot chick.. please.. what happened to old goodies 80's American movies style?Second, but not less important: those robots should have followed physics' laws.. they should make them SLOWER! even more because the special effects were awful.. it is all about computer graphics..IT SUCKED!!!","Jul 16, 2014",4,/10
Am working in NY for a while so jumped at the chance to watch transformers on July 4th. I really wasn't sure what to expect as I am getting pretty sick of CGI based stuff.This film on the other hand was awesome. The 2hrs it ran for felt like 10 mins. The special effects are just jaw dropping and myself and the eager watchers all stood up at the end and gave it a massive round of applause. The acting and story are good but really in 35 yrs I have never seen special effects as good as this. The robots seemed so real and the chase scenes are amazing.Hats of to Michael Bay because this is going to be HUGE when it comes over to the UK. Take your kids and enjoy every minute.,"Jul 9, 2007",9,/10
I am watching the tail end of Transformers as I type this. I tried it several months ago before turning it off after about 15-20 minutes.Do people actually pay money to see this crap? Inane and witless nonsense. I like SFX/CGI movies on the whole but Michael Bay should never have been allowed to be anywhere near a project like this.As for Shia La whats-is-name he should be working in MacDonalds as he certainly cannot act as witnessed by his appearances in the Indiana Jones movie and this sorry excuse for entertainment. Megan Fox just about delivers her lines form an orange visage but she is by no means the babe I have been led to believe that she is. Jon Voight must need work badly if he is willing to take part in this travesty. From Midnight Cowboy to this- what a trajectory!!,"Jul 16, 2011",1,/10
"I was a huge fan growing up so yeah there were many things in the movie that were not 100% like the cartoons. But it was great to see the adaptations made to modernize the cartoon into a movie at present day. I wanted to see this movie for nostalgic reasons despite the fact that I own the cartoon movie that came out in '86 and the first 3 seasons on DVD. The movie did a good job of introducing the characters and story plot while keeping it light and humorous. The bountiful actions scenes were incredible and tied in very well with the soundtrack. If you are a die hard transformers fan you will catch small subtleties here and there throughout the movie from items hanging in the rear view mirror to lines such as ""more than meets the eye"" Even though the characters look different their voices were cast almost identical to the cartoon and the personalities were definitely the same. I would definitely pay to watch this movie and look forward to the second one. I do wish that more characters mainly autobots were shown. However the graphics and special effects were pretty amazing to see them transform and also do battle. I guess the sequel will reveal more of the original characters","Jun 28, 2007",8,/10
"The overwhelming response to ""Transformers,"" a live-action film version of the line of Hasbro action figures and animated series from the 1980s, proves that the days of genuine, brain-dead popcorn entertainment at the movies during the summer months are not yet gone. ""Transformers"" is summer-movie popcorn entertainment of the first degree, seamlessly blending human actors and state-of-the-art CGI into a concept that's virtually out-of-this-world, and bringing it to life.Michael Bay (""The Rock,"" ""Armageddon,"" ""Pearl Harbor"") directed this breathtaking action/sci-fi adventure epic, from a dynamite, intelligently written script by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman that places its key source material, the '80s animated series, under a finely tuned microscope, casts off the dead weight (possible Cold War subtext), adds Bay's trademark music video-style over-direction and you get what is very easily one of the most groundbreaking summer movies in a long time.Like most people, I grew up watching ""Transformers"" early in the morning during my youth. I was one of many young boys who went through the bang-bang-BOOM! phase as an adolescent and looked to ""Transformers"" with a kind of gosh-wow, child-like innocence. I didn't collect the action figures, unfortunately, and although I watched the series whenever I could it was a rare occurrence toward the mid '90s when many cable network channels were rearranging their line-ups. Fast-forward to 2007, now I'm an adult, and I did look with skepticism to Transformers in live-action. And while I've liked Bay's movies in the past, I questioned his abilities to handle something so delicate for a brain-dead 2007 audience.Well...It's his best movie yet, despite his tendency for over-direction. For the most part, he flies on the straight & narrow, with few screw-ups. Perhaps it's because one of his main producers was Steven Spielberg and effects studio Industrial Light & Magic was responsible for the special effects. In the past, Bay's usually worked with super-producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who's gone for now and he seems to be showing signs of maturity as a filmmaker (did I just write that?).For those of us accustomed to the lore, ""Transformers"" revolves around the centuries-old battle between the heroic Autobots and the malevolent Decepticons, massive shape-changing robots of extraterrestrial origin who mistakenly bring their war from home planet Cybertron to Earth. The Autobots find unlikely allies in humans, who join the fray in attempting to banish the Decepticons from our planet. In this big-budget blockbuster, high school loser Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his crush Mikaela (relative newcomer Megan Fox) are thrust head-first into the action when Sam discovers that his great-great-grandfather had accidentally discovered the frozen remains of Decepticon leader Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) in the Arctic Circle. As such, he also discovered an alien power source called the ""All Spark"" that Megatron wants so that he can use Earth's technology to conquer the universe.Well, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voiced by the only regular from the original series, Peter Cullen), aren't having it. And along with an elite Special Forces unit led by Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) that also includes Tech Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and Defense Secretary John Heller (Jon Voight), Sector Seven agent Simmons (a scene-stealing John Turturro), and hackers Maggie Madsen (Rachael Taylor) and Glen Whitmann (Anthony Anderson), it leads to a special effects-laden, no-holds-barred showdown in Los Angeles, where these forces collide head-on in an epic, 30-minute battle that's sure to please those hardcore ""Transformers"" fans and those who might not even know why the hell these giant robots are fighting each other.The film opens with an action sequence in the Qatar desert where one of the Decepticons attacks an American military base there. This scene sets the pace for the rest of the film: a roller coaster ride that is pretty much non-stop for the 143-minute running time. There's never a slow moment for you to capture your breath! With explosions, car chases and machines waging epic war on each other, you can bet it's worth your $8. And there you go thinking that the blockbuster was long dead.What didn't escape my attention was that the film is driven not so much by the special effects, really, but by the actions of the human characters (not that the robots themselves are at all a boring sight). The actors, especially unsung Everyman Shia LaBeouf, are not short-changed and resolved to remain background to the action. The screenplay provides these characters with plenty of moments to shine, with some smart and witty dialogue combined with enthusiastic performances. These are people you come to know and like, not cardboard cut-outs, and likewise they grow on you. (OK, OK, so what about the Autobots/Decepticons?) The special effects are what's most accomplished in ""Transformers."" The actual ""transforming"" scenes really bring the 'bots to life breathlessly, so that when they shift, you're in awe by their forms morphing and reconfiguring, and metal clanking together like living machinery. That first moment when Sam buys his new car - oh, a boy and his new car (a Camaro!) - that transforms into sweet-natured Autobot Bumblebee (voiced by Mark Ryan), it leaves you breathless and wanting more, which you get x10 later on. And you thought this was just another summer movie.""Transformers"" - It's a step up from the cartoon, definitely.10/10","Oct 16, 2007",10,/10
"I had high expectations for this flick and for the first time since Batman Begins, a film actually lived up to its hype. I was literally bored with Pirates and Spiderman 3 as they offered nothing new and had extremely messy scripts where writers think a good movie these days is made up of 17 parallel story lines and run 30 minutes longer than they need to.I won't go into the plot so here's my critical yarn Firstly, Transformers has a fantastic script that is actually filled with great comedy. It maintains a reasonably serious tone but knows when to lighten itself up at its silly premise. The acting is quite impressive with Shia LaBeouf sealing himself as the next Leo Dicaprio/Tom Hanks for generation Y.Now to Mr Bay. People bag him but honestly, have you ever come out of one of his films not entertained? Bay has composed some of the most amazing action sequences here since The Matrix. Maybe not as groundbreaking but for jaw on the floor factor, most definitely.I have never enjoyed a film so much this year since Hot Fuzz. My only rant is that Bay needs to calm his editors down. Some of the action sequences are edited so fast and shot so tightly, it can be easy to have no idea what is going on, but hey, it's a Bay trademark. Lastly, like all modern blockbusters, it could have had 15 minutes shaved off but is no where near as bloated as two aforementioned sequels. Finally, great score.I hope this film does well considering all the nerdy backlash. I grew up with Transformers, I don't remember much but as a film, it will be hard to beat for summer blockbusters...Well until we in Australia have to wait another 6 weeks to see Die Hard 4 and Bourne U","Jun 29, 2007",9,/10

"Having been born in '84, I've watched Transformers religiously as a child. The show was an incredibly influential part of my early childhood, and I've always felt deeply for it and the characters involved.When I first heard there would be a Transformers movie, I was apprehensive. But I was intrigued as well. I went to see this movie with my teenag'd niece. She knew nothing of the Transformers characters, saga, or anything. In fact, she wasn't terribly interested in it. I went in to the theatre fully expecting to walk out, my childhood violated by creepy uncle Michael Bay. The film did not deliver this.It delivered instead a most excellent film that reminded me of days of old. Waves of nostalgia overwhelmed me when I first heard the original transformation sound, and it was all I could do to not throw my fists into the air when I first saw Optimus Prime and shout for joy. The drama of the story sucked me in, and I felt, not violated, but excited as characters remained overall the same as they had been in my youth. And, I must admit, there were a few moments in which I was brought to tears by Prime's words and the Autobots' heroism.Even my niece enjoyed the film, so I'd recommend it for fans and non fans alike.","Jul 14, 2007",10,/10
"I used to love Transformers when I was a kid. I owned some Beast Wars toys and some of the Generation 1 era toys(Autobots and Decepticons). I was also a big fan of both TV series. When I heard that they were going to make a Transformers live action movie I got pretty excited. When I was younger I never thought it could ever happen. Aside from the story which stayed pretty true to the old TV series and the CGI Transformers looking amazing, this movie wasn't good at all and failed to live up to my expectations.Director Michael Bay emphasized way too much on the cheesy human story. Sure the humans should be important characters in a Transformers storyline but there was so much stupid dialog like ""I don't like girls who work on my engine"" or scenes like the one involving Glen and the donuts. Now I am not expecting this to be an Academy Award. Another huge problem is all of the long action sequences which are entertaining at first but just drag on and on after awhile. These sequences could have been cut down some without harming the film as a whole.Oh well at least this film made tons of money and were probably going to be getting a Transformers 2 sometime in the next few years...","Feb 25, 2008",4,/10

"what a great movie. it does what so many recent blockbusters have failed to do. It displays it's multi million dollar effects and CGI to illustrate a well fleshed and well written story line. Too often we put up with poor scripts and one dimensional stick on characters because they blew the budget on 80 ft monsters and explosions. Transformers has the eighty foot monsters but also the well rendered teen angst angle, the nightmare trendy liberal parents and some outstanding comedy from support players Bernie Mac and john Turturro. the young leads were outstanding and watchable and Josh Duhamel shows he is thundering towards leading man status. The action set pieces bring to mind the fun that we had back when Armageddon, Independence Day and Con Air showed blowing stuff up was fun when you do it with real grown up actors and give them scripts written by writers with senses of humour. Even manages to stick in some gentle satire about George W.... or is it .Go for the giant war fighting toys! Stay for the movie of the year so far.","Jun 28, 2007",9,/10
"Me and my 10 year old son both loved this movie. I was really dreading going to see this movie because I generally don't like superhero and science fiction type movies, but I was very pleasantly surprised and may even go see it again because I missed so much since the audience and I were laughing. My only complaint is that there were some sexual comments and cursing that could have been left out and would have made the movie more appropriate for my son. More specifically, there was a discussion about masturbation and although I found it very funny, my son did not understand and I had to explain it to him. Overall, I think it's a great movie as long as you're prepared to explain ""adult"" comments to your child.","Jun 29, 2007",9,/10
"This is, by far, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Everything from the acting and plot down to the editing and color correction of the movie is horrid. You'd think that the one redeeming quality of the movie would be the action, but somehow they manage to mess even that up with shoddy camera techniques and editing such that the entire fight is obfuscated by objects breaking and the dull color palette of the film. I knew that I would dislike the movie from the start, but it fails even as a fun action movie due to the aforementioned poorly done fight scenes and boring subplots that only serve to lengthen the movie. This movie is literally a steaming pile of crap.","Jul 1, 2011",1,/10

I have to be honest and say the story isn't the best story ever... i mean it's pretty crap to be honest, it's kinda like comic book style, you know way over the top (eg. we have to rescue the baby from inside the whale that's about to get killed by the giant volcano that is secretly a pimple on someone's face) ***** but because the acting is so suburb, and because the script, despite it's very fictitious tale, is very funny and keeps you heaps interested all throughout - in my opinion it's a winner...

"Incredible! Amazing! Super! These are the superlatives that immediately come to mind to describe this crowd pleaser.Admittedly, I shared many a Transformers fan's apprehension at having Michael Bay (Armaggedon, Pearl Harbor, The Rock, Bad Boys) direct the film. I'm not particularly a fan of his let's-blow-everything-up style, and most other fans thought he's too old (at 42) to relay their sacred bots' story on the big screen. But despite his cockiness, I'm happy to report that he delivered the goods--and how! Mighty wise of him holding back on the previews, which did not share much of the storyline or even a view of a whole robot; this heightened the anticipation and enhanced the effect of seeing the robots transform seamlessly in all its intricately mixed CGI glory, which really blew the audience away.The action was non-stop and all original (check out the rollerblading 'bot in one of the many intense car chases--a Bay specialty). The Decepticons were really sleek and scary and looked so much tougher than the colorful, dated-looking Autobots, but of course we always root for the underdog. The filmmakers' were also able to successfully translate emotions to the gigantic robots without making them look cutesy and without sacrificing their 'roots'.Bay really made the most out of the plot, and considering Transformers' target audience (reminiscing Gen X 30somethings, mostly male), the result is an exciting ride which was also pleasantly funny in parts. Never mind if there were endless plugs on My Little Pony, Furby, Nokia, etc. They only served to honor one of the movie's messages: that old-school is still cool (and that knowing some ancient tactics can definitely help you in a pinch!).It helped that latest Hollywood hot property Shia LaBeouf (Disturbia, Indiana Jones 4) was likable and had good comic timing, and the staple Bay hottie was played to the hilt by the beautiful Megan Fox. Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas) releases his reliance on his looks to play the leader of the Special Ops team who first gets attacked by the Decepticons.Autobot leader Optimus Prime has been called one of our generation's strongest father figures, and his fate in this movie will definitely please his fans. You might be surprised to see him with lips in this version, although it is said that in the later Japanese animations, he already had them.Finally, a summer blockbuster for the year that isn't a sequel and doesn't disappoint! A sequel is sure to be in the works, featuring the other Transformers who weren't featured in this installment. Yet another flick to anticipate!","Jun 28, 2007",9,/10
"This movie is not about being an emotional and thought provoking experience. This movie is about giant robots and explosions. And it excels. The movie starts quickly, there's not much in the way of an explanation as to why the Transformers come to earth. Basically, there's something they want, and they've come to earth to fight over it. The plot is mostly just an excuse to get some robot action going. It's actually nice that the plot is so simple, because it allows the movie to start fast and keep going. The movie has quite a few, somewhat awkward funny moments. They all seem a little bit forced, but that doesn't stop them from being funny. In fact, some times it actually makes them funnier. Some people would argue that it's not realistic, but when I go to see a movie about cars that turn into giant alien robots, realism isn't at the top of my wish list. Whatever the movie lacks in the drama department, it more than makes up for with its original brand of robot action. The Transformers and Decepticons are a sight to behold. Whether they are fighting, flying, or transforming, they all look amazing. When a large fight breaks out, missiles and laser blasts decimate buildings, and send cars flying. Not all Transformer technology is a weapon though. And there is a rather funny incident involving their alien technology and a Mountain Dew machine. I will say no more. To wrap it up, the final showdown Between Prime and Megatron is and genuinely intense, and you really don't know who's going to come out on top until it's all over. And I can honestly say, I wasn't expecting it to end the way it did. It's not a twist that will blow you away, but it keeps the movie from being predictable. If you're into robots, or action movies in general, check this one out.","Jul 4, 2007",10,/10

"This movie is the action packed film that every child hopes for over the summer months. I'm sure I would have loved it at the age of 10 myself. Unfortunately I'm in my 20's and find myself needing more than fight scenes and explosions. If that's all your looking for from this film, that's what you'll get. A derivative story line, with sub-plots that have been told a million times. Atrocious dialogue that will appeal to the lowest common denominator, and children. Cookie cutter quips, and a chick with a great ass...oh, and some CGI. (yawn) Blockbuster action films can be done well. The first two X-Men films are a great example of action films with crisp dialogue and good story lines. Michael Bay doesn't want to make films like that though. It would involve a minutia of risk and he can only safely spew out a film that's certain to do well at the box office, but will be utterly disappointing to even the least discerning fan. He's making films for a profit. That's fine. I applaud his business sense, but watching his films is like staring at a casino floor. His entire filmography is a soulless coin-op machine.","Jul 19, 2007",3,/10
"I just came back from the premier where I live, and this is, quite frankly, the most amazing blockbuster ever in years.To get this out of the way first, the bad points of the film were that the two human protagonists, don't seem to act all that surprised when discovering the first transformer. I feel that the film could have done without the love plot line; its too clichéd in blockbuster films these days.Also, the story is told entirely from Sam Witwicky and the Autobot's point of view, which means the decepticons are almost never seen interacting with one another. The rivalry between Starscream and Megatron exists only in one spoken line.Its a pity, considering how the original cartoons divided equal time between the autobots and decepticons, but I guess that is what the sequels are for.If you are fine with that, then this movie is an absolute blast. The action scenes are lengthy and breathtaking. While the decepticons aren't given much speaking lines, there are a lot of scenes showing them wreaking havoc on anything other than themselves.The action scenes are unbelievable. I'm a pretty harsh critic when it comes to action scenes in movies, and I have to say nothing tops the climax of this film. I won't say anything more, except to suggest that you try not to blink. You don't want to miss one millisecond of the climax, trust me.The plot is simple, and structured well. Don't expect a deep, thoughtful storyline that is bulletproof from scrutiny, but expect something that is entertaining and follows the original cartoons in spirit. There was maybe one scene which dragged on longer than it should have, but thats about it. The whole show is quite long at 2 1/2 hours, though a movie on this scale deserves to be 3 hours long.Overall if you can overlook the above mentioned flaws, this is the summer blockbuster to compensate for the disappointments of Spider Man, Pirates and Shrek 3. If you have to see one summer blockbuster, make it this one.","Jun 28, 2007",9,/10
"I am quite new to the Transformers bandwagon and went to the movie Melbourne on the first day as I was dragged by my friends who are absolutely crazy about the Movie.But I have to say I was quite surprised to my amusement, I found the movie to be absolutely great entertainment... the concept was easy to digest as I am a fan of fantasy adventures based movies so got stuck into the feel of the movie quite early in the movie.The introductions to the characters was quite subtle and the excitement grew as the minutes passed by. The CGI was simply awesome and so were the sound effects. In the first 15 minutes of the movie sets you up with what can you expect in the next hour and half.The story was simple and the pace was gradual and one can easily feel that something big is coming later down the line in the movie. The movie reminded me of T2 though at different points of time ...in fact there was one instance in the movie where the T2 theme was also played ( maybe not purposely) The lighter moments involving the character of Sam Witwiky and his life and other characters around him were not over the top and actually made we laugh but concentrated in the first half of the movie and the comic timing of the actors and the scene placement was perfect so kudos to the editing team.I don't want to divulge a lot of details but overall the entertainment value of the movie was great and I loved the concept and how it was handled by Michael Bay and his crew...which we can expect from a director of his caliber.I would recommend the movie to anyone who is into action/SciFi adventure and good clean fun.","Jun 29, 2007",8,/10

"I went with friends expecting a popcorn flick and got it... I wasn't bored, but I certainly felt that it was a movie lacking any depth (which is fine).Comparing this movie to a movie with an artistic angle is like comparing a gourmet meal to a hot dog. The gourmet meal takes much more finesse and skill in preparation and there is a specific design to what the chef wants the taster to perceive. A hot dog is made from a generic formula of hodgepodge ingredients to form something that most people can settle on. Michael Bay uses explosions, sexual imagery, cliché social jokes, and special effects to create the ""hot dog"" of the movie industry.Just like a hot dog is an appropriate American summer tradition, so are popcorn blockbusters and there is nothing wrong with that.","Jul 9, 2007",5,/10
"I am a fan from the cartoon series, not an OTT obsessive fan, but a big fan all the same. Who doesn't want to see huge transforming robots? And the transforming robots, for the most part, are awesome CGI. I think it has set a new benchmark in terms of what is possible with CGI.Don't worry about Hugo Weaving as the voice of Megatron, its not a biggie like some people thought it would be, although the faces aren't great. Fans already knew before the movie from the hundreds of photos posted on the internet that the faces were significantly different from what was in the cartoons. I personally felt they could of been a bit less complex.Megan Fox is smoking hot in this movie and reminded me of a young Tea Leoni (think Bad Boys). Sam is a character that grows on your and the relationship with Bumblebee is a nice touch reflecting the tight bond they shared in the cartoon.There are a lot of slow motion shots, some people like them, some don't, I thought maybe a fraction too many, but anyone who has seen a Michael Bay movie knows to expect that.In summary, this movie is spectacular and must be seen on the big screen!","Jun 29, 2007",9,/10

"As other people, I will start by saying that I am in my mid 20's, so i grew up with transformers. Never been a fan or anything like that. Before watching it, I was convinced that this is going to be one of those movies with a great trailer but the movie itself is going to be a total letdown.Let me start with GRAPHICS: There are no graphics in this movie...it's reality. It is simply stunning. No shortcomings, graphics are perfect. Every single reflection on any surface is rendered perfectly.I don't think that you could make this movie better in anyway.Music : Was totally great (I bought the album). Humor : There's a lot of it. Action: Total action all the time - just great.In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever in it's category. I just saw it yesterday, and I just can't get it out of my head, some scenes where just amazing and I want to watch it again :D","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10

"I walked into the theater wondering about Transformers, I knew that it would either be one of the worst comic-book movies of all time or one of the greatest. It turned out to be the latter. The sound effects were awesome, and the special effects were top-notch. Combines, they made a very realistic effect, and after the first ten minutes I knew I was in for something really special. The storyline was even better. I wasn't a huge fan of the original series (I am only 13) but I know a lot about it, and although I admit that some of the robot designs were dramatically changed, I think that it was for the best. Overall, I recommend this film to anyone who has any taste for good movies. I can't wait for the sequel!","Jul 3, 2007",10,/10
"Transformers tries to be the big Epic of the year. It has incredible visuals, a multi-character storyline, and a lot of spectacle amongst other things. All of this in a running time of 2hr 45min, a respectable running time for an epic.However, all this adds up to just a big, dumb action movie in the end, miles away from the original animated series, and compared to it, this film is very disappointing. The plots and characters are all over the place, losing track of some characters and plot lines here and there, all to make sure all the spectacle scenes can take place without any real logic or reasoning behind them. You can tell that at the pre-production stage the actions scenes were carefully written and choreographed, and the rest (characters, plot, basic story, logic) were added in as an afterthought. While the CGI is okay, the character designs aren't really good at all, the Transformers looking like a mess of mechanics instead of the amazing alien characters they once were.And this is all spread out to almost 3 hours too! Big, dumb action movies are never supposed to be that long! In the end, Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg just decided to make their own film out of the franchise, they don't really care about the franchise one bit. Even so, it could have been so much better than this. It could have been a decent 90 minute Sci-fi actioner and everyone would have been happy. And if they actually took the story and it's potential seriously, this could have been the Sci-Fi epic that they clearly think it is.","Jul 27, 2007",3,/10

I'm gonna bring them and surely (100%)they'll enjoy.This is one heck of a movie. It's really AWESOME! Better than all Spider-man movies combined. The special effects/CGI is superb...i have to commend all the people behind this movie especially the director Michael Bay and one of the Executive producers, Steven Spielberg for making this spectacular movie. The story is simple and straight forward which the audience can follow through from start to finish. And the acting performance of the cast (especially Shia LaBeouf) is also great. Action packed and funny. Never had a dull moment.It's a cinematic feat par excellence! Transformers RULES!","Jun 30, 2007",10,/10
"To be fair, there was about 30 minutes of good material in this film. The roll-call sequences for the Decepticons and Autobots were just great. And John Turturro was easily the best actor and character in the entire film.Still, when the plot has even less substance than the original 1984 film, you know something is just not right.For the most part this is just Michael Bay poop filled with poor editing, camera work, music and a whole lot of nothing.Let's not even mention the product placement. Or the Bionicle style Transformers. Or the overlong running time. Or...you get the idea.","Jul 9, 2007",3,/10
"Being a big Transformer-head in my younger days I had mixed excitement and dread leading up to the film, Bay directing, various design changes but then Spielbergs guiding hand and Peter Cullen returning to voice Prime.Low and behold I have not been able to think of much else recently but seeing if Transformers would turn out to be an enjOyably big, totally loud action movie with Gigantic robo-stomping action or just another disappointing title coming from an old property.Hey, I love being wrong. I enjoyed the hell out of the movie. Its loud, proud, has smattering of Michael Bay tack (which could have saturated the 2 hours 20 minutes). The only niggly issue I had was with some of the excess side characters, but when the crap hits the fan then its on and they essentially disappear.And when i say the action starts, the last hour is full on, high adrenaline and it is very impressive to watch. And Starscream kicks ass, every sequence he is in, he is ruining people, gotta love it.One of the things I liked is that it was aimed not at kids, but more to the middle audience, teens and above, several cut off obscenities and awkward conversations with Sam's parents (very funny) make the film feel like an actual film rather then just an advert for merchandise.All up, I really enjoyed the film and was pleasantly surprised by how much I did so. Came out of it pumped up and ready to go again...which I am tomorrow.Roll Out!","Jun 29, 2007",9,/10
"Well said!!! Couldn't have said it better myself.I am a big fan of the 80's classic and the vision that Bay and Spielberg gave to this updated 2007 is fantastic. At the end of it all the characters of the Transformers especially the Autobots are still very much there.In fact watching this gave me goosebumps especially seeing Prime and hearing that all so familiar voice of Peter Cullen, memories of being a kid in front of the TV back in the 80's watching the series came flooding back. Almost brought a tear to my eye.I can't wait for the sequel.","Jun 28, 2007",9,/10
"Blown away as i sit in my seat in the theater. I was worried so much that this movie would do a mis-justice to the name ""Transformers"". I am proud to admit, it does not. This movie is fun without being cheesy. Jaw-dropping action/special effects kept me from blinking the entire movie. I cannot stop thinking how great this movie was. SOOOOO disappointed in the majority of BIG budget action movies over the years. I finally found one the lives up to the hype. BRAVO! to everyone involved in the making and creation of this movie.

"This was one of the movies where I had no problems going to the rest room and buying another coke while the movie was still running. Sure, the special effects were top notch but I can really not understand why the overall ranking is so high. The story is OK but not really brilliant. The characters are likable but not really bright. The comedy was pretty average and didn't make me give it more than a gentle smile here and there. And when the big show down came it made me almost wish the bad guys would win because the good guys were so lame and stupid. I'm not angry I paid money for it, there are worse things to waste an evening with but I really have to shake my head at the ranking here...","Nov 20, 2007",4,/10

At first, I wasn't quite interested on watching it but I watched the making of on the TV and I totally changed my mind! I had to watch it! And I did. The visual effects are so great, the colors, the cars are beautiful and all that transformation is so incredibly well done! I was so amazed with that! Shia LaBeouf is great here (and in many many other movies). He is so hilarious and he was a great choice to be in this movie. It's a very interesting movie, great images and there were so funny scenes that I really, really laughed - like those scenes when Shia is on the car and Megan Fox is going away and the car doesn't stop playing all those love songs... his embarrassment because of that is extremely good! Hilarious! Great Summer Movie, definitely!","Aug 4, 2007",8,/10

"I'm not a 'hard core' fan of the old transformers. I was a little young to grasp all of it back in the 80's, though I did have my fare share of the toys. Prime, Megatron, bumblebee are names I have known.So, I was a little excited when I heard they were going to make a movie and even more excited when I heard my favorite director - Micheal Bay - was helming the project.But nothing I say here, or what ANY one writes or tells you, can describe what you will wittiness in that darkened room.It's like nothing you have ever seen before.And not only the giant robots stole the show. It may be a surprise, but all the 'human' actors were very, very good. Which, in my opinion, is a rare thing in a film like this.I could go on and on about this film but I don't want to give anything away.All in all: Funny, exciting, scary, thoughtful, visually stunning, well directed movie.

"Got to see this movie on the 29th of June in Thailand. Already released here but not in the USA. This movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and is a great Action flick with some unreal special effects. It's need the length to fully detail all that is about to happen later in the movie. Really Enjoyed it! The actors involved do a pretty good job and the storyline was to me well thought out and convincing. Have not seen Fantastic 4 - Silver Surfer yet, But from what I have heard this movie definitely has a better plot line and special effects and they look dramatically real. I would suggest to anyone looking for a great Action - Sci-Fi Flick to definitely go see this movie. Too Bad in Thailand movie s are only $3.00 not the outrageous $10.00 to $12.00 as in the USA.","Jun 29, 2007",9,/10

"This summer blockbuster stunk worse than the bathroom of a Mexican restaurant on ""All-You-Can-Eat Fish Taco Day."" The acting ranged from acceptable (Shia Lebouf) to horrific (Jon Voight). As expected with any action film, the character development was lacking. It seemed that to make up for this, Michael Bay had the soundtrack play for what seemed the entire movie. If I have to listen to that Linkin Park song one more time, I am going to lock myself in the closet and listen to My Chemical Romance until my ears bleed. The corporate sponsorship was very apparent in the movie as well since 90% of the script was written about E-Bay or GM Products. The lines were cheesy and awful. The voice overs for the robots, or ""row-bits"" as Jon Voight refers to them, were terrible as well. It felt as if we were actually in the cheesy eighties cartoon at times.Overall, wake up and smell the coffee fan boys. This movie stunk. If your heads weren't so far up your asses regarding your childhood robot fantasies, you would have noticed it too. Quit focusing on the CGI and try to remember how horrible it actually was. Remember this, if you find yourself saying that this is the best movie ever, it speaks volumes about you as a person and your intelligence. It may also cause your friends to remove you from their ""five"". Hmm, there is another shameless company that could have been promoted more in the film. Maybe the sequel..","Jul 15, 2007",3,/10

I think it's a great movie, with a good story, great humor, outstanding action and incredible acting. They did a fantastic job with the casting, not only with the cast but also with legendary voice actor for Optimus Prime, Peter Cullen.

"I really loved the original Transformers series. I owned and still own a couple of transformer toys (such as: Soundwave, Optimus Prime, Cosmos, The Stunticons, etc.). I also used to have the ""original"" Megatron toy, but it got broken and I had to throw it away (pity...now it's priceless at E-Bay). I really hated the way Megatron looked and acted in this movie. The good things about the movie: 1) The special effects; 2) I liked some of the comedy of the human characters; 3) ?????? No, I don't know of any more good things...sorry!The bad things: 1) The story was so lame...they should really have taken more time in fleshing out the story! 2) Some cube that you can use to make robots out of almost anything that's made from metal and such...stupid s@&t! 3) The editing...who did this! It was unbelievably terrible! 4) Megatron and that little decepticon that transformed into a radio, later a cell phone. That little robot was one of the most annoying things I've ever seen on screen. Jar Jar Binks was even more likable and that's saying a lot! 5) I quit...my childhood sentiment is pretty much destroyed by this movie!I had high hopes and doubts about this movie. The summer movie for which I had the least of hope was Die Hard 4.0, but it turned out to be the best one of the summer movies I've seen so far. The others I've seen are: Spiderman 3, POTC; At World's End, Die Hard 4.0 and Transformers. I hope Harry Potter is any good...nah, I already know it's gonna be a lot better than this piece of junk (as said by Luke Skywalker)!I's a pity that they will probably make more Transformer movies!","Jul 25, 2007",5,/10
"I thought Live Free or Die Hard was completely action-packed...It's interesting to see what a complete 180-degree turn the reception to the Transformers movie has made on the movie-going public. Most took it as some bad joke but as the trailers emerged and we got a glimpse of the robots in disguise, we couldn't take our eyes off of them.Transformers works well as an action movie, especially when it's an action movie based on one of the longest-running toy lines ever. It's intriguing that so much occurs in the first half-hour or so between the Decepticons' attack on the world and a fight between Autobot Bumblebee and Decepticon Barricade that you forget that the other Autobots haven't even arrived to Earth yet. I'd never been in a more enthusiastic theater. Cheers were everywhere when Bumblebee becomes the '08 Camaro, and when Optimus Prime transforms and introduces himself. The filmmakers understood that we want to see the action between the good guys and bad guys and thankfully refrain from some 'adjusting to life on Earth' subplot.Shia LaBeouf gives an incredible of a performance as Sam. He gives in way more than was probably asked of him for the role, and he ends up being just as good a part in the movie as the robots themselves. He's got a lot of awkward charm that is a great balance with his love interest Mikaela. The scene where Bumblebee, because of his lack of speech, uses the car radio to help Sam win Mikaela over is a riot. The movie manages to do fish-out-of-water comedy well. Some moments seemed to overdo it a bit, but they're made up for by the fact that it was genuinely funny. I also enjoyed how the Witwicky family is your average American family with its ups and downs that aren't victims of Hollywood screen writing. They're likable enough people without being obnoxious and obnoxiously sappy.The one thing one must prepare for when walking into the movie is that it is a brutal, intense, violent movie. How many times has the shot of Bonecrusher smashing through a bus made people drop their jaws? The robots don't get into comic-book fights where ""Pow!"" and ""Kablam!"" fill the screen. They are out to kill one another, amongst a really powerful score for an action film, no matter what it takes. Some characters get hit worse than others. They're glorious battles, but neither faction holds back. Michael Bay certainly didn't, which is why he was the man for the job. Some shots during the fights were all over the place and were kind of disorienting with the thousand robot parts moving everywhere. For the most part, the action is beyond well-done. The movie also features some of the most inspiring uses of CGI in a film. In a world that's getting tired of the technique, it is amazing to see them transform every single time.Fans, hardcore or casual, can breathe. It was that good. It isn't the '84 cartoon, and thank goodness for that. Also, Hugo Weaving is very scary as Megatron.","Jul 4, 2007",9,/10

The special effects are superb. . The characters are good and the story line is above what I expected. All in all I was expecting a so so Sci Fi type movie with a little terminator included. What I got was 2 hours of great entertainment. All I could say on the way out of the theater was ""Awesome""My wife did not want to go but after the movie she said the movie was great. That speaks volumes as she never likes these type of movies I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a summer block buster.

The character development is displayed perfectly and you can feel the on set chemistry. I've spent days trying to write this review, to even try to fathom the beauty I've seen. I've tried.

You've got a fast-pace, action-packed story with really cool robot transformation for eye candy, including a cute-looking boy and a very sexy girl. That doesn't count the powerful battle scene from the military, fighting to protect the world.A very outstanding thing about this film are how they can make those alien robots look so cool! I really enjoy watching them transform themselves and get into actions and transform back into cars or even radio, although I'm not quite an action movie fan and I'm a woman. They make the good robots become likable characters and even funny. We can even have sympathy for them when they are hurt, giving emotional side to this very-action film. The vibe is quite positive. You know that the ending is going to be happy and can look forward to it. The cast are suitable for their roles and the editing of the film makes everything fast and exciting and entertaining. The soundtrack has the right kind of music and come at the right moments in the story.Overall, I recommend the film if you just feel like having a fun roller-coaster ride.

"I sat and watched it and yawned the whole way through. It seemed like the whole 112 minutes was just a whole lead up the the last 20 minutes were something actually good happened, but even then it was just one of those graphical blurs were you can't even make out what the hell is happening, all you see is some flashes of characters and a few punches getting laid in to them. The plot was horrible, I mean, they were after a God damned cube! Sure kids may like this movie, because it's shiny to look at, and to be fair kids like horrible movies. I used to like The Mario Bros movie, but now when I watch it I realise just how crap it really is. All I can say for this movie is that Michael Bay has done it again. He has taken something I love (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and flat out dumped all over it. What a jackass. What's worse is he's planned a sequel, what will the plot be in that?! Will they chase down another shape, perhaps a sphere? Who knows? All I know is that I'm not gonna pay to go and see it.It would be a pity to see a good movie like Harry Potter get beat by this piece of crap.The one good thing I can say about this is that the CGI was good looking, the robots looked real. However I'm not one of these people that thinks a movie is great because it looks shiny. (The Matrix) Therefore I gave it a 4.","Jul 21, 2007",1,/10
"Only one word to use that will sum up this film....BREATHTAKING!!!!!OK, I am a 39 year old female who remembers her children and nephews' fixation with this animated genre but, really, for something that is based upon what is essentially a very masculine cartoon fantasy, this film has too be seen to be believed.One would expect the special effects to dominate the film but, if anything, they become secondary to the actual core of the storyline.The robots have believable humanistic qualities whilst still retaining their fantastic ability to change into any mechanical object they come into contact with. The audience will find themselves rooting for the good guys, whilst marvelling at the determination of the bad.If you do get to see one remake of an iconic animated series, make it this one...you will be wide eyed and in awe all the way through!","Sep 6, 2007",9,/10
"Its a a Saturday night, myself, 2 mates and one of mates room-mates, are sat around drinking, when the room-mate mentions he has Transformers...within minutes we are all sat down, ready to watch, all of us fans from a young age, just hoping it would at least be good, as we sat with high hopes and low expectations. 2 and a half hours later, we sat there, as the credits rolled, and looked at each other. None of us want to say anything, all to scared. Finally, I speak. ""That...was....f***ing...amazing"". Next thing i remember, its an hour later and we had been discussing the movie nonstop, saying how good we thought it was. There is no perfect movie, before anyone starts saying against this movie, but, I walked in, wanting a action film with good characters. The action - breathtaking, the robots are seamless in their movement and look beautiful as they do battle, as realistic as I could have ever dreamed and fit in the picture like a glove. The main characters, while their may have been too many with the army and the computers geniuses, were complimentary to the story, and the action seemed to do so well cause of the many characters, the army and Transformers, led by Optimus Prime, against the Decepticons, manned by the evil Megatron. The story, original in its depiction, is a great ""MacGuffin"" as Hitchcock coined it to the story, and was perfect for setting up great battles. Sam; Shia LaBeouf was amazing, plain and simple. Many action movies have to have a hero whose muscle mad or a member of MENSA. Sam, is different, he is neither, and yet better, he is a human character full of emotion and fear, and yet feels he has an obligation to help the Transformer,s this is his breakthrough role, look out for him. I don't want to give away any more, because I feel like I would be spoiling it, but, I hope this slight teaser, may be sufficient enough to convince you, this film is worth a try, and is very entertaining, just have fun it.","Jan 23, 2008",9,/10
"It is very good. I love Megatron and Starscream because they transform themselves into a space fighter jet and an F-22 Raptor fighter jet. Because I like fighter jets, so I do not like Optimus Prime and Bumblebee since they transform themselves into cars, which I do not like. Blackout is a villains which transform itself into a MH-53 helicopter.My elder brother says, ""Autobots become good friends with Sam over time. It is very touching because in the real world, there are no Transformers."" This film lets us know it is possible to build friendship between robots and human beings. The love story of Sam and Mikaela is also very touching because he helps her repair her car because she cannot start it.The action scenes of the film are most exciting because the special effects are very realistic. When Megatron and Optimus Prime are fighting at last, Sam uses the energy cube to help his good friend Optimus Prime destroy his enemy, Megatron.","Aug 18, 2007",10,/10
"I really wanted to like this film. The trailers were awesome and even when the words ""A Michael Bay film"" flashed up, I was only slightly worried. I should have known better.So it's five out of ten because it's half good; that half being the half with the Transformers in it. The humans are really of no interest whatsoever, save perhaps the two central characters. The scripting is dire, there are no memorable lines and it would seem at times that if you were to read the script every line would end with an exclamation mark (even the questions).That said, the effects are jaw-dropping! The fights are spectacular and the sound effects whizzed, whirred and pinged appropriately and for once, loudly. Kudos to Bay at least for realising that an on-screen explosion should rock the theatre, not sound like someone passing wind! However, the battles at times are tricky to follow, particularly when the Auto-bots and Deceptocons (TM?)are fighting each other, as they are just a frenzy (sic) of gears, pistons, wires and hardware, intertwined and knocking seven bells out of each other. Bays frantic camera work (Cut/new angle/zoom/pan/tilt/cut/zoom out/pan - all in 2 seconds) does not help at all. It just adds to the confusion.One last minor barb is the fact that, although the Autobots are introduced, they are not fleshed (automated?) out and the Deceptocons are not introduced at all - they are just there to kill everyone. It seems we are expected to remember their personalities from the 80s cartoons and carry on from there. Extremely lazy! So, no real story, no dialogue, no characterisation, amazing effects. Oh, and way to long! Two hours and twenty minutes is too long for an action film, but it seems to be a trend in Hollywood at the moment. When will they learn that you can't carry a film that long on sfx alone? Halfway house - 5/10","Jul 28, 2007",5,/10
"This movie was an excellent one with a varied cast, but the film makers left a lot of details out. It went from showing one thing to another and it seemed as though the director forgot about what happened in the movie in the last scene- It went from showing a robot attacking humans to another scene leaving you asking what happened to the robot? The movie had a pretty diverse cast with actors from all over and it had its shares of laughs. It has nice GM vehicles and very great special effects as well as its shares of explosions too. All in all it is an enjoyable movie with a lot of humor mixed in but they should have done a better job directing it.","Aug 2, 2007",8,/10
"Firstly, I'd like to say that I'm not the type of person to write reviews like this, but I was so disappointed in the film that here I am. This speaks volumes already. The following is a short review I wrote on a forum which I frequent:BAD film!! It totally molested all that was 'Transformers'. Humans outrunning transformers, the transformers looked cack IMO.. Too scrawny and not blocky enough with enough colour. They were weak. The voices weren't great. The music was terrible! Nothing Transformer-y about it. And what was with the crappy humour? The biggest thing was probably the focus on humans throughout, which was one of the biggest mistakes possible, IMO. Who cares about humans when there are Transformers!! The film was bad because of: - bad acting - typical soppy scenes.. very cliché - totally Americanised in the worst way possible - Crappy plot - Sometimes couldn't tell what was going on in the action scenes.. way too FXed up.. more story and character development, please. Everybody came out saying it was great, but then they didn't look like the type of people who would think full-stop. Oh, I missed the first ten minutes, but I'm glad I spent running to the cinema. At least I got some exercise out of it. I am totally disappointed. 3/4 of the way through I started racking up the bad points for this review. I think I've said enough.If you really want to see some Transformers, get the original cartoon series on DVD. Althugh it costs a lot, it's a much better alternative than giving Michael Bay money to watch this utter travesty.","Jul 22, 2007",2,/10
"Was there any need to make all the other summer blockbusters so bad and terrible when Transformers were gonna blast all of them away? Nay, for Michael Bay has won over his critics with a gritty, and heart-pounding movie that all Transformer fans would love.Nostalgic fervour aside, the CGI was outta this world, the great action to boot simply complementing. Sound and visuals work in sync, nothing more to say.Shia LaBeouf was simply fantastic in his role, in the movie that will propel him to stardom after bit part roles in movies like iRobot. Megan Fox was the flower vase, but just about as hot as BumbleBee's engine. Josh Duhamel suited the action hero role in his first major movie role, and the rest of the cast did well, with just about the right dosage of humour injected.My only grouse is that there could have been a stronger plot, and the ending was a bit muted and anti-climatic. Megatron and Starscream should have been the villainous stars, but they got too little airtime.Can't wait for Soundwave to come out in Transformers 2, and maybe being a bit more greedy, how about the DinoBots at that. AND, they have to ensure Peter Cullen reprises his voice as Optimus Prime in the sequel.","Jul 2, 2007",9,/10
"When i heard that they are gonna come up with a Transformers movie i thought it'll be crap, because it's very difficult to make huge robots realistic. First I saw the trailer and thought it was amazing, then i've seen on TV how the robots ducking behind a house, and thought it's crap. Now that i've seen it i can honestly say that is really a good movie worth watching, don't get me wrong it's not Oscar material (maybe the special effects), but still it's a really a great action flick with great special effects. At the end of the movie i saw the name Spielberg and i realized why it's so great. Believe me, you will enjoy this movie, i hope they do a sequel.Oh, and one more thing, compared to other huge summer blockbuster films over the years, in my opinion it's much, much better than others, like spider-man and it's sequels combined.","Sep 23, 2007",9,/10
"Seeing this movie last night down here in Melbourne, I was eagerly anticipating what Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg had done in their recreation of an excellent cartoon series that I passionately followed whilst I was growing up in the '80s. I was certainly hoping that the huge queues were worth the wait!! Be you a fan of the series or not, the introduction to the movie was brilliant and really set the scene so that everyone in the audience knew the basic ""history"" of how the Autobots and Decepticons came into being, and how they've ended up on Earth. This also ties together very well with Optimus Prime's general demeanour and compassion for humans whilst allowing the audience the opportunity to understand his views concerning the difference between good and evil.The first scene of battle (perhaps I should change that word to chaos) was set to perfection, showing exactly what the Decepticons were capable of, and also allowing all of the human actors' roles to come into play. Speaking of which, the casting and acting for this movie was absolutely top-notch, from the main stars all of the way through to supporting actors. Shia LaBeouf is proving himself to be quite a fine actor and carries the wit and humour effortlessly throughout the entire film - he will be a star of the future, without a doubt. You will love the depth of well-known actors in this film and can relate to each and every one of them in some way or another. Surprise performances by Bernie Mac, John ""Sneaky Sneaky"" Turturro, Amaury Nolasco (Sucre from Prison Break) and Anthony Anderson were highly welcomed by the entire audience, which was a sell-out. Every single actor played their roles well and played the role as a hero in their own way.The character development in the first half of the movie tended to drag ""just a little bit"", but fortunately this was compensated by the humour - even the parents get into it quite a bit, and the scenes concerning the backyard proved a hit amongst the audience (you'll know what I mean when you see them).Near the end of the first hour (I think) you really start seeing the movie hitting it's strides - I actually heard a member of the audience say ""Yep, it's just kicked up a notch"", and it certainly did. The action just doesn't stop until the final credits from that point. Whether you're a fan or not of the cartoon series, you will thoroughly enjoy the film, which has a little bit of everything: action, humour, romance and excellent special effects which will literally blow your mind. It was great to see Optimus' flaming sword make an appearance that doesn't disappoint.Even the characteristics (and facial expressions!!) of the robots are brought into the film. Jazz's humour and likability, Ironhide's intolerance of humans, Ratchett's intelligence, and Starscream's wishes to be the leader of the Decepticons (whilst always acting subservient to Megatron). Fans of the series - listen for the catch phrases of ""Roll Out!!"", ""Decepticons Attack!!"" and ""You wanna piece of me?"". :-) I particularly enjoyed the use of music at various parts of the film - who would've thought that ""Baby Come Back"" could have been used so well?Above all, enjoy, but I would recommend a word of caution though - this film IS NOT for young children at all. I could imagine quite a lot of youngsters ending up having nightmares for a few evenings after watching this film, with Decepticon screams going through their heads (especially when Shia LaBeouf comes face-to-face with one of the Deceptacons).","Jun 29, 2007",9,/10
"Fun special effects, but otherwise an ad for GM, Panasonic, HP, and the US Air Force. I can forgive it for being an ad for Hasbro, but the other product placements and cheesy pro-military statements (""you're a soldier now!"", ""these men never give up"") were too much. I enjoyed the special effects, although I don't understand how the transformers gain in mass when the get bigger. The toys I had as a kid transformed, but they did't grow! Also, why was that little one (the radio/cell phone) able to take on just about any shape? If that's the case, why didn't Bumblebee just grow his legs back, or Prime become a plane when they needed to go faster? Too many plot holes for me.","Oct 24, 2007",5,/10

"Insulting the people of a country is one of the activities that Hollywood is proud of. This is also a kind of racism and self-righteousness that Hollywood teaches children. I am sorry. It's better to remind the author of this movie about the Iranian geniuses who made the country's industry progress in America itself. Those who won the highest scientific awards and...
This is an insult to the people of Iran, not a corrupt government inside Iran.Also, the director of the film should understand that in order to continue the film, it is not necessary to destroy the story of a film and change it in general. Sometimes it is enough to spend a little creativity and not lose a lot of budget.","Jul 18, 2023",4,/10
"While concerned if this film would be able to transfer well from a toy and T.V. series to a live-action movie, I was still excited for a film about the toys that a played with in my youth. Although the movie is based on this idea of a toy line, this movie is in no way suited for kids. It is extremely intense but flat-out cool.Director Michael Bay succeeds in finding a good balance between the humans and the Transformers, as the film is not overloaded by supreme special effects as ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" fell victim to. Steven Spielberg, as the ""people's director,"" does a fabulous job in causing the audience to relate to Shia LeBeouf's character, among others, as they struggle to survive among a race that's warring on a planet which isn't even their own. Incredible visuals, interesting story. 3.5/4 stars","Jul 5, 2007",8,/10

"Most people who comment on this title gave average to very good ratings, so there's not much to say about this movie, everything i need to say can be found in these comments, so i wrote this comment for you wise-arses out there who gave this movie only 1 star rating.IF YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHAITE AND THINKS YOU CAN DO BETTER IF GIVEN THE CHANCE TO PRODUCE THIS MOVIE AGAIN, CAN YOU ACTUALLY MAKE A BETTER ONE THAN THIS????????? i didn't go through the comments which has average to good ratings, but i read through all the most hated ones and found out most of them are complaining about bad story and no in-depth character exploration and stuff. I only need to ask you this, how long is the cartoon series and how long is this movie? there's your answer.....by making a cartoon series into a movie IS NOT POSSIBLE! it just takes too long to build up all the character development and shXt, even if you make it into 3 movies like LOTR, you won't have enough space to fit all those things in, and i'm glad they didn't. And about story line, it's the same as character build up, it's just too much to tell. The story of the movie is like a compressed version of the original cartoon series, think about it and you'll find a similarity.If you complaint so much then go make your own Transformers movie and we'll see which is better, and don't be talking/complaining/comparing about budget and money and shXt like that because you guys have all the brains in the world, getting a few million bucks to make a movie won't be that hard is it???","Jun 29, 2007",9,/10
"The way I see it there are two problems with this movie.First, there were a dozen extra characters who served no purpose other than to prolong a barely connected subplot. Threads were begun -- one taken directly from Independence Day -- that had no resolution or real bearing on the story. The result is a good forty minutes you could edit out without impacting the story at all.Second, this is a Transformers movie in which key players didn't start appearing until halfway into the film. It feels less like a dramatic buildup and more like a floundering story. Only a fraction of the movie contains fighting between the bots and there's even less in the way of character background or development. While most of the Autobot personalities you do see will be familiar to us 30-somethings, we never really get to know the Decepticons at all.The only positive thing I can say about the film is that the few battles you do get look great. In the end I think it suffers from lack of focus and not delivering enough of what I really wanted to see. Reinventing the story is absolutely fine. But at its core, it's supposed to be about epic Good vs Evil featuring transforming robots. That's just not what this movie was about.","Jul 10, 2007",2,/10
"Was unsure if I should take my 8 yr old son to see this movie but did it anyway & he couldn't stop saying ""this is cool!"" It was really good mainly due to the AWESOME SPECIAL EFFECTS! The acting I would give a b+ rating. But I highly recommend it if you are a transformers cartoon fan. You won't be disappointed. I wouldn't take children under 7/8 yrs of age due to some adult subject matter - like masturbation. My son asked me during the movie what they meant by that - but forgot to ask again once we left - thank goodness! I am not ready for that talk yet! Otherwise it was one of the few movies I have seen at the theater that was actually worth the money to see on the big screen. ENJOY!","Aug 11, 2007",9,/10

"Apparently, everyone who hated this movie is not a true movie fan at all. You're supposed to go to movies to be ENTERTAINED, people. Thats what they're made for.... ENTERTAINMENT. Lets talk about Transformers: sure there are plenty of faults to be found with it, like there is for every movie ever made. Sure Mike B is not the best. Sure there shoulda been more CGI. Sure the dialog is teeny jargon. BUT SO WHAT? This is the first try at a 'live' action Transformers movie since the cartoon. And they did a damn fine job of it, too. And if any of you yahoos remember from the original story-line, the Autobots were on Earth to do their thing and not harm humans.... hence the centering of the human side of things in this one.So if you don't like the movie, keep it to yourself, sit in your little cardboard home, live out your pathetic non-imaginative lives, and let the rest of us be ENTERTAINED.

"I'd been psyched up a bit after hearing about this film for months, back into 2006 even. Leaked pictures and rumours piqued my interest and I hoped beyond hope it wouldn't be bogged down in some meaningless tale (a la Spider-Man 3) or be utterly preposterous (geared towards fans or kiddies only.) As it turned out the film has a couple human threads entwined in the tale of the Transformers. Some of it's cute, a good bit of humour and doesn't get bogged down in it. Some of it is silly, but it still works well as an action movie. Optimimus Prime (and the other autobots) are bit bit impatient and it's inspired comedy to watch these metal monsters creeping around and trying to hide.The action sequences are fast, very fast. I have been informed I missed a couple details, not necessary to enjoying the film, but perhaps meaningful to the character of a certain Decepticon. The action moves along very well and when the final battle takes place it's fast and furious. Saturday morning cartoons were never like this. The Transformers were never like this and this, this is GREAT! For those looking to nitpick plot-holes or the re-imagining of your childhood, you may as well stay home and play with your Rockem-Sockem Robots, because this is going to be different. I didn't mind one bit as I was watching a spectacle which suited the big screen. I'll see this again and again. Fun and exciting, well executed.To Mr. Bay and his team, well done lads! Well done!","Jul 4, 2007",9,/10
"When I first entered the cinema, I thought this was going to be another childish, immature movie with a an amateur plot. I quickly thought again. Suddenly, we were flashed into a film, in which children, teenagers and adults would thoroughly enjoy. If you like action, adventure and thoughts far beyond the imagination, this film is definitely for you!! With occasional scenes of comedy, which give that extra touch to the film, this film definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. Typical life for teenagers is combined with fantasy and happenings in this remarkable movie. Some negative points include occasional glitches in special effects and some make-up mistakes. Overall, it is a must see film which I thoroughly enjoyed.","Aug 1, 2007",8,/10
"And by that I mean the ""fight"" between Optimus Prime and the evil bot.

That this junk has got 14 sequels or thereabout, says very much about the state of modern movie industry.","Mar 29, 2022",1,/10
"Somewhere, someone in the upper echelons of some toy factory is finally having their day. They had to have thought that toys that could transform from diesel trucks and sports cars to giant robots would make a good impact beyond the TV screen. They had a go at it in 1986 with the animated ""Transformers: The Movie"", but now, CG technology has caught up with the toys and has given to us a live-action ""Transformers"".What we have here is an action-packed, non-stop wall-to-wall thriller. A movie so aptly named has a whole lot of transforming going on, and some of it happens so fast that the viewer is still piecing it all together through the following scenes.With all due respect to other 2007 big summer hits that have been released so far, like ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"", ""Oceans Thirteen"", and ""Spiderman 3"", ""Transformers"" is the one that packs in as much of the action and comedy that's possible in a 130 minute stuff-goes-boom movie. Whenever the action would slow up enough to relax the audience and allow some funny stuff to happen, some scenes induced such hearty laughter that my sides would ache until the action revved back up.This was the first PR screening I had attended in quite some time, and it reminded me of why I believe it's a better experience than the general release. It's free, obviously. More importantly, it's guaranteed that most in attendance are at least casual fans of the subject matter and most importantly...the atmosphere is electric because there is crowd reaction. Accompanied with raucous applause is the beginning, key scenes, and end of the show. Big reveals are met with theatre-wide gasps and groans of anticipation. And every time the signature sound of a transformation occurred, there were nuts in the crowd (such as me) that would gleefully cackle. With that...I have to admit. I was childishly hoping to find some Solstice in the parking lot transform into an Autobot. Laugh it up, Hasbro and Michael Bay...""Transformers"" will bring out the die hard fan or inner child in just about everyone. There is much more here than meets the eye!""Transformers"" gets a perfect 10 of 10 stars.","Jun 28, 2007",10,/10
"While everyone seem to love this film, I can't find anything appealing to me. Some people said that this is one of the greatest movies of all time when clearly it's not. I don't know what most people look for in a movie these days but it's certain that they don't look for a good movie. They prefer robots and explosions above clever plots and great performances.What we have here is a cliché filled film. From the very beginning until the very end. I don't know about you but I can't enjoy those things. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that I have watched really impressive movies and most movies nowadays are not up to them.On the other hand I must say that the animation and special effects were incredible. I still can't believe the quality it reached. The interaction between robots and humans was great also, it was like they were actually talking. But the merits of this movie end there. It has one of the most mediocre plots added with really average performances.When some people and I were talking, I asked them what was about this movie that they loved so much, and their answers always were: ""The robots looked incredible"". But does that make a film good? The answer is certainly no.","Apr 2, 2009",3,/10
"On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this movie a 10, with 1 stipulation which I will expound on in just a moment.The movie was very well written. Orci and Kurtzman have proved themselves time and time again while working with J.J. Abrams. These polished writers were able to mix up enough of the traditional Transformers storyline while putting in a horde of exciting scenes and a driving storyline.The film making was exceptional. The editing made the movie easily viewable and the extravagant special effects added to the ""wow"" effect of the whole movie.Now about that stipulation I was talking about. In one scene, when Witwicky's mother was wondering about his delay in opening up his bedroom door, she asked ""Were you masturbating?"" I submit that this did nothing but drag the movie down. I am from Utah where Mormonism is the most prominent religion, and they, as well as several other religions, believe that any sexual act before marriage (including masturbation) is strictly forbidden by commandment. Therefore the open discussion of masturbation is as much a taboo as talking about any other sexual act.Friends of mine were so offended at this mention of masturbation that they got up and left the theater. I cannot blame them. At this juncture in the movie, I was uncomfortable, while holding my wife's hand (having been married nearly 3 years). I quickly looked around the theater to notice that most of the seats were filled with pre-adolescent youth. I sympathize with the parents of all those who took their children to the movie and were confronted with this dilemma.I'm sure there are millions of people who had no problem with the comment, but I believe IT IS NOT HOLLYWOODS PLACE to teach (or incite a discussion about) the birds and the bees to our youth.At the video rental store, I got into a discussion with one young mother (about this particular movie scene) who informed me that ""I won't be taking my children to see Transformers, now that you've told me that."" The movie was great, but I'm not going to buy a copy of the movie until I can find a way to edit that phrase out of the movie.","Aug 8, 2007",10,/10
"Everyone I went to see Transformers with echoed my sentiment: ""I had high hopes for this movie, I was a little wary, but it blew my expectations away!"" Being Transformers, it could have been really terrible and campy, but it truly rose to the occasion! The timing was excellent and made me sit up on the edge of my seat. The animations were perfect, and the characters fleshed out well. The story (and many of the lines in the movie) were fairly standard, and Shia LaBeouf was the same character that he plays in every movie he's in. But honestly, in stead of working AGAINST it, these ""flaws"" worked FOR the movie. And amazing movie, and you should go see it. Right now.","Jul 3, 2007",9,/10
"Transformers started as a toy line in 1984, soon transforming into comic books, television shows and now movies, with the first being released in 2007, directed by Michael Bay. Transformers stars Megan Fox, Shia LaBeouf, Rachael Taylor, Josh Duhamel, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and Peter Cullen.Robots known as Autobots and Decepticons have come to Earth. The Decepticons want the cube, which can create or destroy worlds. With the help of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), the Autobots must destroy the cube to keep it from falling into the wrong hands.I watched Transformers when I was younger but I'm glad I watched it again. There were many things I had forgotten I liked about the movie, such as the action throughout the film with some funny moments mixed in.To blend in, the Autobots and Decepticons transform themselves into everyday objects such as a car or a radio. I'm reminded of how McGonagall, James and Sirius, could transform themselves into various animals in Harry Potter. In both films, I found this entertaining.Between what's happening with the military in Qatar and the events happening where Sam is, there's lots of action scenes. My favorite was when Sam was chasing his car, I found it extremely funny. The car was driving on its own while Sam was running after it and yelling at it. He thought someone stole it. If you like action movies with light humor, you should watch Transformers.","Jun 6, 2023",8,/10
"As someone old enough to remember the original transformers-mania I was totally disappointed to see another opportunity to re-produce an 80's great wasted. After multi million dollar SFX , none of the transformers look accurate to me, the CGI looks out of place against real time capture and Bay's shaky-style camera work set pieces doesn't work . I couldn't work out what this was supposed to be, the script was something out of a kids movie, but the set pieces pulled from a wannabe combat flick. The movie falls short on both levels Another turkey to add to Michael Bays list of big-budget garbage pile that includes Bad Boys, Bad Boys2, Pear Harbour and producing a string of crap attempts at horror remakes.","Feb 5, 2010",3,/10

I have a Wide Screen 37 inch TV but man I bet my rating would be even higher if I had a 50 plus one. I am looking forward to the sequel as it looks even bigger and better & I'm sure when it hit's Blu-Ray it will be kick-butt! Even if you didn't like the film, this is a perfect film to watch on Blu-Ray that is for sure. Get this Used & watch the great sequences especially the end as it looks and sounds superior especially compared to the now defunct regular DVD. Skip some of the relatively dumb plot & watch the robots kick each others butts because it is very cool.

Without a doubt, the visuals in this film are the main attraction, and ILM clearly made every effort to impress to create one of the best animation to live action films in the recent or distant memory. The human cast is exceptional Shia Lebaouf is humorous and more impressively believable, Megan Fox nor Josh Duhamel are hard on the eyes, but pull more than just eye candy out of this adventure film. With the supporting cast, holding aces like Jon Voight, John Tuturro and Rachel Taylor the engaging part of this film is it never really allows you to lose interest.

Rumours about this film started long before it was made. Claims that it was going to be amazing. I can't review the end of th movie as I had to walk out just after half way with boredom. Worst example of CGI trickery and lack of script I have seen. This has such a bad reputation that it should make producers think before relying on special effects to sell a film.The cast are left to goggle at the green screen or whatever was used to put the robots on and then return to wooden interaction. The robots give better performances than the flesh and blood cast usually. The story is taken from the cartoon series which itself was a merchandising tie in. Roots come to earth to continue their battle. The best part of the film is the theme these robots and their origins suddenly takes.,"Apr 2, 2009",2,/10
"When I first saw this motion picture in the theater,I have to say that out of all the movies that I have seen,this one is the best. This film is just like the original series. The Autobots and Decepticons were a whole lot different than the original series. The movie was so great, I had to get this for my collection,and I did. When my sister got me this movie on my 25th Birthday,it was just like seeing the movie in the theater once again. It was really the best once again. I have to say that Peter Cullen does a great job playing the voice of Optimus Prime, just like in the original series and 1986 motion picture. I do feel bad that Frank Welker never to play the role of Megatron just like in the show.But however,this film is really okay. Favorite character I liked in the movie:Optimus Prime,Bumble Bee,and Ratchet. My favorite funny part was when Sam's little dog Mojo did his business on Ironhide's foot.

"I have just seen the movie and want to tell about my experience. Visuals effects 10/10 Really really good made. The transformers look and move very very nice. Sound 4/10 The sound effects of the transformers and general quality is fine, but destroyed by teenage popular wannabe rock-music. It's a bit too much high school musical. Not brutal enough, it made the robots seem like delicate women at a tea party.Acting 1/10 It is terrible. Megan fox looks great, but then she opens her mouth and every word just makes her look more and more stupid. Shia Lebeuf or how ever it is spelled acts as if his life depends on it. He simply tries too hard, like the young person he is, is he probably trying to show his best only making it awful. The rest of the characters also overact and this is including the transformers. Especially the twin-transformers act like small children, taking the role as the two stupid sidekicks like in a Disney cartoon.Story 5/10 I am giving it five because it has potential. The movie lacks brutal power. Evil transformers kill and wreck havoc on the world and not ONE drop of blood is in the movie. The childish acting and teenage way the story is told ruins what could have been an insanely good story.Conclusion. If you like unintelligent romantic teenage ""wannabe action"" films(twilight, captain America etc.) this is right up your alley.

"First off, Micheal Bay has a way with over dramatic dialog, and many ""Oh no he didn't"" come backs. I absolutely hated Armageddon, and there were some scenes of this film that were just kind of lame. But, that was just the screenplay part. Transformers fans? This will be better than Christmas morning! I'm 23, and obviously had the toys, watched the show, etc. The animation and integration of CGI with live action is ABSOLUTELY STELLAR, MIND NUMBINGLY AMAZING, JAW DROPPING, and the over-all WOW effect was used ENTIRELY too much. I had my jaw drop on several occasions, and just couldn't believe what had been accomplished on film in this piece. The standards have been raised VERY high, and this is the absolute best CGI I've ever seen. (I'm a wanna be animator.) Rewatchability is VERY VERY high on this film. (Although some, not ALL acting was horrible. I hate the whole ""upstage"" the government mentality that Micheal Bay creates in all his films. It's a horrible staple, but he made up for it with the incredible explosions and action. I hate to give this film an 8, but it's a ""get out there immediately and see this film"" 8. If the screenplay had been a little bit less corny, I would have 9'd it.","Jul 2, 2007",8,/10
"I was one of the boys who grew up with Transformers.It was in the beginning of 1990 when Transformers were introduced to China. As a boy from a poor family, my only transformer toy was bumblebee. I used to stand in front of the shop for hours and hours every weekend just looking at the toys until they were all removed from the shops in 1996. It was a dream of a young boy.Now I have huge collection of the G1 toys, however, the feeling was deeply hidden in the heart of the boy until he heard the familiar voice: I'm Optimus Prime.I watched it three times. The return of the transformers means a lot to me.Thank you, Michael Bay.Thank you all who made this movie.","Aug 12, 2007",10,/10
"I'm a fan of the Tranformers cartoon and I have to say that the movie wasn't very good at all. The fight scenes were, honestly, the worst I have ever seen. It was a just a huge mess where no one could really tell what happened. When you have to wait for the movie to come out on DVD and then stop and watch it in slow motion to actually see what happened, that is totally unacceptable. The story was not very well thought out or executed either. This movie was another classic case of the best parts of the movie were in the trailers to lure people in. Megan Fox was probably the biggest reason this movie didn't totally tank at the box office. All the fanboys couldn't get enough of her.","Jun 25, 2009",4,/10
"I have seen all the transformers movies and many iterations of the cartoons too! Artifical intelligence based sentient beings (robots), come to Earth to take refuge as their home cybertron is dying or there is a war going on over there! These fictional movies are not only thought provoking but give us a glimpse intonwhat artificial intelligence based and enhanced robots could become in a couple of years or even in the world of today! The story was the same as good vs evil, no matter what time or place good always triumphs against evil, no matter what the cost. Human beings, the best of all species have a tendency to never give-up, as optimus prime says, till all are one, I liked each and everyone of the movies and cartoon series too.","May 29, 2024",8,/10

This movie was overall totally great i love the way that they bring everything together into one thing (the glasses) my favorite part had to have been the part in the beginning of the movie were the windows break on all of the cars. The way they added all of the problems in this movie to end out in a perfect movie is awesome.I have to you people i have seen some pretty hott girls in my life but this one was dang hott. This movie mostly brought attention by its amazing special affects.I mean how could anyone think of to transform these guys perfectly that had to have taken years to figure out.Especially the way they had transformed the all spark from a giant rock to a little cube.,"Nov 24, 2007",9,/10

"Now I have to admit, I've never watched a Transformers cartoon in my life, I was in my mid to late teens when they were a hit back in the 80's, only three things were on my mind, Metal, Football and getting laid!! So it must be said that when it was announced that there would be a life action movie of the show I really wasn't that excited or interested, that was until I saw the first trailer which blew me away. It has to be said I don't think you'll have seen special effects that could top these, the robots look astonishing and are, as you would hope and expect the stars of the show.Who cares about lousy dialogue and slightly ropey acting, all I wanted to see was robots kicking ass and smashing thing up and boy do you get it!! The film has quite a long running time of nearly 150 minutes but it zips along at a good pace, you never have to wait to long for an action set piece and there's always the eye candy of Megan Fox to fill in the gaps.Easily the Summer movie of the year, daft, action packed with a good dose of humour, looking forward to part 2 already.....","Oct 1, 2007",8,/10
"I thought the new Transformers movie was sub par. I am confused as to how close to 80,000 people could have voted it a 7.9 when it clearly had many serious flaws: 1. Soundwave (aka Frenzy) was as bad as Jar Jar Binks. Instead of making him a cool spy, like he was in the television show, the makers of the film decided to make a crazy ""Soundwave"" spy. Why? For cheap laughs from tots. 2. The plot could have stretched over 2 to 3 movies, easily. Instead of developing a complex plot and strong characters, the directors relied on action-plot and special effects. 3. Excepting Optimus Prime and perhaps Bumblebee, the other Autobots and all the Decepticons were horribly void of their television personalities. Megatron, Starscream, Ironhide, Jazz (Jazz died! LOL), Ratchet, Barricade and Bonecrusher all came off more as personalityless soldiers who happened to be caught on film while fighting a war. YOu know, those faceless soldiers of WWI and II. Moreover, Megatron and Starscream, two of my favorite characters from the television show, came off as a couple monsters. In the television they were much, much more than that.4. The mechanics of the transformers were too visual. Just like in the new Star Wars movies (metachlorian), Transformers The Movie showed me too much. I didn't want to see every mechanical connection, thanks! Granted, the actual transforming scenes were quite amazing, especially when Bumblebee transformed from robot to a car, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the movie lost a significant portion of the mystique that was present in the cartoon. 5. More annoying comedic relief: specifically the secretary of state and government agents. 6. Although I consider the ""autobots hiding on Sam's house from his parents"" a high-point of the film, I also consider it a low point. For five minutes before the autobots hide on Sam's house they are made to look like a bunch of buffoons. This was especially distressing in relation to Optimus Prime, who is suppose to be the wise leader of the autobots. Instead, he looks like a complete idiot. Optimus Prime, the wise leader of the Autobots, is not smart enough to understand Sam when he says ""hide! my parents will see you!"". Overall, I think this movie is similar to AI. It has many good points that make it watchable, but its bad points prevent it from being a classic. 5/10","Aug 16, 2007",5,/10
"well after a very long time here comes a movie , when i was actually disappointed when the screen flashed interval. everything about this movie is awesome. the CG is state of the art better than lord of the rings or star wars. the plot is beautifully written , you don't have to know about transformer series to enjoy the movie. the narration is god like, i don't know whose voice it is but he can be president of USA. also there is good amount of humour sprinkled through out the movie, and its really funny or should i say witty.there are some sequences where u will actually hold your seats and avoid blinking. the soundtrack is inspiring. overall a very good package from Micheal bay , and even Spielberg appreciated it.this is one of those movies which you would like to add to your collection and wait for the sequel which is being made. better than any james bond movie.","Aug 31, 2007",9,/10

His melodrama, with the omnipresent and boring triumphant music, almost made me want to walk away from the movie theater. Bad jokes and some humor parts that can't even be called childish (aka ""plain dumb"") alternate with good action scenes. The (few?) battles are well balanced - you don't get your eyes and ears tired from too much robots and explosions.Fortunately, he didn't screwed everything and the movie is a good eye-candy entertainment.Worth viewing, but still forgettable.","Jan 11, 2010",5,/10

"Transformers. Ah, the good old care free childhood days. If you ever watched the Transformers growing up, you will not be able to stop grinning throughout this movie. The whole theater was literally clapping at the outcomes of some of the action scenes (I myself don't clap at movies). I read a few critiques of this movie, complaining about the plot, or lack there of.. well if you know the story of the Transformers, then you know exactly what kind of plot to expect, and this movie will not disappoint. You will enjoy the action scenes, the special effects, the sweet cars, and you will even laugh at the humor, which came unexpectedly to me. I would highly recommend this movie to any Transformers fan, I'd even go as far as to say it's a must see for you fans out there.","Jul 3, 2007",9,/10
"WOW!!! What a fantastic movie. Sure a few flaws and goofs, but really a neat movie. The special effects and flow are very well done. Looks like a sequel may be coming, as the ending is like the 1st Star Wars (Episode 4) ending, with Darth's ship still intact at the end of the movie. It is worth to stay during the credits for the entertainment by the parents. Forget the laws of physics in this movie as the Transformers appear to be able to not only change their appearance, but their mass as well. OH? What do they feed on?? They appear to have unlimited energy resources and liquids, but we never see them digest anything to replenish their energy levels. Anyway, why would anyone consider laws of physics when attending this movie anyway --- just enjoy it. The movie is a good the 7th time viewing as it was the 1st time. Fortunately a theater here has $3,$4, $5, and $6 tickets available and every show is in DLP --- WOW!!!!!! If you love science fiction which defies laws of physics, then this is a fantastic movie. A lot of violence, so younger children may not be appropriate viewers.","Aug 9, 2007",10,/10
"good special effects but thats about it, flimsy pointless plot appears to be just a vehicle for the special effects. the main bad point is the script which is terrible and cringe worthy at times, typical American Hollywood sentimental rubbish and the robots are more like power rangers with the stuff they say, like it was written by a 10 year old it started OK then went down hill and by the end it had got so cheesy it was unbearable, the typical 'i love you and i will always love you no matter what happens' type lines spring up, the robots are just as bad and seems to be engaged in power ranger style conversation even when they're fighting using thick American accents, one of them even talks with a African American style...yo brother cut me some slack lol. there's also a lot of product placement in it but i guess they've got to get the money from somewhere. it all ends up so predictably in a big fight yada yada yada... and by the end i didn't care if any of them lived or died just as long as it finished, i fast forwarded the last 10 minutes.don't waste two and a half hour of your life with this.","Mar 11, 2009",3,/10
"Transformers (2007, Dir. Michael Bay)When teenager Sam Witwicky buys his first car, what he doesn't know, is that it's actually an alien robot. This isn't the only alien to arrive on Earth. Optimus Prime and a fellow group of transforming robots have arrived in search of the AllSpark. But, Optimus Prime and his Autobots aren't the only aliens to appear. Megatron and the Decepticons are also searching for the AllSpark, and it would do anything to get it, even if it means destroying the city.If there was ever such a definition for the ultimate male film, then one example would surely be 'Transformers'. It's got cool looking vehicles, the army, a hot girl, explosions, rock music and everything else guys seem to like. This doesn't mean that the female population won't enjoy it. It's an amazing film. The special effects are the highlight with amazing looking robots and some beautiful action scenes. The action on the cinema did make it hard to work out, but once you watch it on a normal TV, it's much more clear whats happening. There are some interesting characters featured too. John Voight brings a character which is nothing like himself, and Shia LaBeouf was perfect casting. This was the film which made me such a fan of his. The running time might be a bit long, but it needs a long running time just to fit in such an incredible story. Be prepared to be blown away!""What's going on?"" - Maggie Madsen (Rachael Taylor) ""You're coming with me."" - Keller (Jon Voight) ""You're going to be my adviser."" - Keller (Jon Voight) ""Me, too?"" - Glen Whitmann (Anthony Anderson) ""Who's this?"" - Keller (Jon Voight) ""He's my adviser."" - Maggie Madsen (Rachael Taylor) ""He comes, too."" - Keller (Jon Voight)","Dec 7, 2007",8,/10
"The thing about Michael Bay's Transformers is that it tries to advertise itself as some kind of epic battle with every 80s kid's favorite robots, but instead we get boring things with humans. We paid to see a giant rock 'em sock 'em robot film with huge battles, not some boring human stuff! To make manners worse, it has a staggering runtime of nearly 2 1/2 hours, and although runtime isn't a huge problem with most films, but in this film with 20% robots and 80% humans, it's too long.What's the story? The fate of humanity is at stake when two races of robots, the good Autobots and the villainous Decepticons, bring their war to Earth. The robots have the ability to change into different mechanical objects as they seek the key to ultimate power. Only a human youth, Sam Witwicky, can save the world from total destruction.I know, I know, tons of audiences appreciate this film, but I'm sorry, I thought it was REALLY bad. The storyline is very uninteresting, and like I said earlier, it tries to be interesting, but most of the time we get Michael Bay's awful choices in directing, ending up to be a more human-driven movie than a robot-driven one. We wanna know about how Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and more came to life. And that's the sad part, because they don't do a great job at explaining their backstories and they leave it to the sequels to do all that. Actually, scratch that! The SEQUELS don't do that EITHER! They're just rehashes of THIS film! Now, of course, not everything is bad about the film, there are still some exciting action scenes (when we actually get to them, first of all), cool effects, and great work on the sound department. But other than that, it's just a total mess.In conclusion, Transformers is nothing but a giant clash of bad quality. It's got great action, great effects, and great intentions, but other than that, the movie doesn't live up to any massive expectations. I guess if you like the toy brand or the original cartoon, you MIGHT like this movie, but other than that, this is a film to skip. Michael Bay, you've done it again. And don't think that's a positive statement, either.","Oct 17, 2018",4,/10

"I first heard about Transformers when it was a cartoon so I thought the movie was going like the cartoon or even like the animated movie but I was wrong I went and so this movie in the theatre excited because I like science fiction and action so the two combined makes a hell of a mind blowing movie and what a mind blowing experience Transformers turned out to be. There are great actors such as Shia La Beof and the sexy and beautiful Megan Fox and man is she frigging' hot she made me sweat so much when I look at her. The best things the action sequences when it starts from the beginning to the end! and the bad thing is that some actors such as bernie only had a few minutes in the movie so he could have made it more funnier for longer but hey what could you do. What ever you do don't miss this astonishing movie on any account. Finally if like hot acteresses, cool cars and breath taking action then you won't be disappointed by this magnificent master piece that is from one the masters of action Michael Bay. All you need to do is sit back and enjoy!","Jan 11, 2008",10,/10
"The idea of a Transformer film isn't really such a bad one. There's so much potential for eye-popping action and there's a cool sci-fi element to the franchise. I remember the cartoon and the toys. I kinda liked them. This could be alright! Whoops, Michael Bay directed it? Oh well, forget any hopes.Seriously though, there is absolutely no substance whatsoever. I'm not expecting The Godfather, but I'm expecting a film that's entertaining beyond robots fighting and things blowing up. I mean, it tries to pass cheesy jokes and bad references as some sort of charm. And I don't care about Shia LeBeouf or his love interest... who doesn't do anything. Hooray for strong female characters. I can't even remember their names. Really, absolutely awful.","Feb 27, 2010",1,/10
"I can't remember the last time I felt genuinely entertained watching a movie like this. I had a lot of expectations for this film (especially with all the hype and anticipation surrounding it) and I'm very glad to say that (for me, at least) it really delivers! This is definitely one of those movies that set out to entertain you and does a wonderful job doing so. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth your while and your money.I'm not a big fan of the Transformers universe and mythology, but of course I still did want to see this movie for the same reason that everyone out there wants to see this movie: The Robots, The Action, The Story. The Transformers Universe is filled with all sorts of wildly interesting characters and story lines that would make a great movie, and I must say that the producers (Tom DeSanto, Don Murphy, Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Steven Spielberg), the writers (Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and John Rogers) and director Michael Bay did an incredible job in adapting Transformers for the big screen. That's it!About the cast: Shia LeBeouf shines in his role as Sam Witwicky. I believe that his performance made the movie all the more funny and credible at the same time. NOW I understand why he's in the next Indiana Jones movie... The storyline was also quite interesting; all the action and plot twists were properly integrated in the film though to some small degree, parts of the movie were predictable. Thankfully, there were only a couple of scenes which I thought slowed the movie down. But who cares about these things? (grin) I must particularly mention the humor and atmosphere of the movie. Even without the robots on screen, the movie manages to hold your attention with its humor and dialogue. Also, there's something for everybody! For those delving into the Transformers universe for the first time, they will find the story and characters very much interesting while fans of the cartoons, comics and toy line will definitely be blown away with the most important elements of the film: The Autobots and the Decepticons.So how were the robots and the action? All I can say is that those guys at ILM must have been working day and night just to deliver the stunning visual effects of the movie... All the robots were beautifully rendered and the action scenes were topnotch! I have never seen visual effects so detailed and so seamlessly integrated into live-action environments and elements. The groundbreaking things they have done on this movie will definitely have to be admired and commended. The ending was carefully thought of All I can say is that you'll leave the theater surely wanting for moreSo to sum it all up, Transformers will definitely be the must-see film for the summer movie season of 2007. It's engaging, funny and has loads of the ""Wow"" factor sure to make you ask for more!","Jun 30, 2007",9,/10
"I usually do not comment movies, but Transformers are honorable exception - this is such bad movie, that I have urge to warn potential viewers to keep away from this title.Watched movie today, in Imax theater, London (which is by the way, impressive way to watch movies - real experience).Story is shallow, act is no good, and robots do not look scary. There are too many fast moving scenes of fight, that you usually see just blurry trails of fighters.There are so many naive scenes (won't mention here, potential spoilers) and it is way too pathetic ... close to Independence day.Stay away from this film; comics is much better.Regards, Dejan","Oct 14, 2007",5,/10

But, the special effects are astounding, the action is constant, and the humor cracks me up. I am so glad Peter Cullen stayed as the voice of Optimus Prime. Hugo Weaving also did a great job of Megatron. His character was just too cool and the voice was convincing without thinking ""hey, it's the guy from 'The Matrix'"". The humor was well placed without being hokey or forced. The effects blew me away--I keep asking myself ""how did they do that?""

Other than that the movie was quite boring.It was also quite childish and a good action movie can't be childish. The age group this movie was aimed at was too young for my liking and that is part of the reason why I didn't like it.

"Michael Bay's Transformers (2007) is a visually stunning blockbuster that blends explosive action with unexpected charm. The CGI is groundbreaking, bringing the Autobots and Decepticons to life with breathtaking realism. Bay's signature style-dynamic camera work, slow-motion hero shots, and grand-scale destruction-ensures an adrenaline-fueled ride from start to finish.Shia LaBeouf shines as Sam Witwicky, delivering humour and energy that make him a relatable protagonist. However, what truly enhances the film's emotional core is his chemistry with Mikaela Banes, played by the mesmerising and very beautiful Megan Fox. Their interactions feel natural, filled with playful banter and unspoken attraction, making their romance both engaging and believable.Fox's beauty is undeniable, captured through iconic cinematography that emphasises her striking presence. Yet, beyond aesthetics, she gives Mikaela strength, confidence, and intelligence, making her more than just a love interest. Her ability to hold her own in the chaos of battle adds depth to her character!Transformers is pure cinematic escapism-thrilling, visually spectacular, and filled with heart. It may prioritise spectacle over story, but it remains a wildly entertaining experience.","Feb 15, 2025",9,/10

Now what is wrong with it: Michael Bay, Shia LaBeouf, Anthony Anderson (if hackers were like this in real life we would not need any firewalls ever), screenplay, dialogs, acting, casting all of it, on screen interaction entire time...It is, well, bad beyond description.

But when i first saw the trailer early 2007 it blew my expectations to pieces.Finally it's here.Oh my god this movie kicks ass, serious, serious ass.First of all the acting was good from Shia leboef ( if thats how you spell it) who played the geek desperate for respect and the beautiful girl played by megan fox.He then gets a car who turns out to be a race of alien robot fighting with their rivals the decepticons.The special effects are everything and more and the CGI blends in perfectly with the live action.The action is spectacular and it had the right balance of comedy and action leveled perfectly.definitely the best of the summer blockbusters.","Aug 1, 2007",10,/10
"One thing is for sure: you won't find any stunning good acting, deep, complex characters, remarkable plot lines. But than again, who cares?- no time to think bout that when a bunch of huge robots go berserk on each other. Never before have I seen so perfect VFX. The interaction with actors and the environment was just as true as it gets. It verbaly dished me in the chair and I stayed there the entire movie. Great design, not going too far from the cartoon (apart from Megatron, and Bumblebee not being a VW). I was truly amazed with the way the creators brought to life heros of this all-time classic carton that I remember well from when i was a childI also was prepared for those cheezy, pathethic moral scenes. Here again nice surprize: they didn't over do it at all. We get a well mixed blend of teen humor, mind-blowing action and of course special effects of the highest quality. Just as it was suppose to be. I give 10/10 because it was exactly what I wanted to see that night in the cinema (maybe even a little more)","Aug 17, 2007",10,/10
This was a great movie for kids to see a cartoon turned into a sci-fi action flick where there were lots of explosions and robot destruction scenes. I mean what teenager doesn't want to find a companion on a death defying adventure against the aliens of some of world planet. What would they even want on earth if they came from another planet? The main character of course gets his first car and is already in the throes of American problem of how am I supposed to up keep these old vehicles that were a starter that would last him till he got his first major pay checks to go with the next or trade for something that he chose himself.,"Apr 7, 2025",9,/10
"Transformers - Sam Witwicky (name alone tells you how seriously they took the subject matter) finds an old Camero that uses some Herbie and Nightrider tricks in the hope of getting Sam laid by no-way-in-he11-is-she-in-high-school Mikaela Bane (Megan Fox). It turns out the weird car is *gasp* a ROBOT IN DISGUISE! by the name of Bumblebee. The robot sends out a signal to the coolest Autobot (Good guy for short) ever and step-father to a generation of small boys in the 80s, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen).Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving and he11 if I could've figured out it was him, and I loved V for Vendetta) is on Earth and is after a cube. Why? That's not important right now. He's a Decepticon, and if you can't keep them straight it's in the bloody name. DECEPT-icon. Like deception= bad guy. Oh who gives a crap. Look the point is that there are some wonderfully intense robot on robot action sequences. Crap gets blown up. And I hate Bay, but he sure can blow things up.Transformers is quite possibly the dumbest movie that you may find this summer. Parts of it may also be the most fun you'll have at the cinema this year. Hence I'm torn about this movie.The music keeps telling you otherwise, but huge chunks of dialog in this film are jarringly awful. Nearly everything is played for laughs. And there are plot holes galore with no logic save action movie logic. Every minute the robots are not on screen is a moment wasted. The script felt like a couple of teenage boys just willed for the coolest stuff to happen in their own alternate universe.""I only got a B- on a project where all I did was hock my granddad's crap for 3 minutes? I can convince my teacher to raise it to an A-.""""The coolest girl in the class? Yeah. She's on Maxim's top 100 Hottest Women list, and nevermind her popular asshole boyfriend and my awful attempts at wooing her. She's going to like me eventually, and (I sh!t you not, this actually happens) sit on my lap, just because the movie says so."" Yeah right toy-boy. In your dreams. The film almost has a mad brilliance to it. It's like Bay knows we'll stomach these laughably tired things he does for the sake of those f***ing awesome robots.Boy does he know us well. Hook, line, and sinker. Those robots are enormous, kick @ss, and were money well spent. I could watch them transform into robots and back over and over and never get bored. There's one that's a tank, there are two awesome jets. There's even one that's a Mountain Dew machine in perhaps the most shameless product placement in cinema history. A minor problem I had though was that it was kind of hard to tell who was who sometimes. Megatron and Starscream kinda looked alike at a glance. Fans of the series will be mixed on the whole because the robots WERE awesome and true (for the most part) to the series they love so well. It's the humans that gum up the works.Jon Voight plays perhaps the most inept Secretary of Defense I've ever seen. John Tuturro is kinda ineffective, kinda creepy, kinda lame. Where was the menace I saw in ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" and ""Secret Window""? Anthony Anderson continues down the pathway of ""Chubby Comic Relief"" hell. Shia LaBeouf is alright as the awkward protagonist. It's mostly this god-awful script that the cast has to deal with. Nearly everything is played for laughs. The robots are fine for the most part. Megatron and his Decpeticons ooze menace and Prime is fatherly and the Autobots are likable. It's just shame that the film didn't center around them.The movie was made for the big screen, and will be worthless by the time the DVD scrolls around, so see it now, not then. Bay is still a hack, but he shore done made them robots and explosions purdy and will doubtless make a bundle from this very fun, astronomically flawed movie.I give Transformers a B-. Oh, and did I mention how cool the Transformers are?","Jul 10, 2007",5,/10
"I just got back from a pre-showing of Transformers in my hometown, and even though I was born a little to early to ever watch the Transformers cartoons, I have to say that that movie was one of the coolest movies I have ever seen.At a quick glance at the actors in the movie, I was a little skeptical. Shia and Tyrese? Seriously? But thankfully after halfway through the movie I disreguarded the fact that these two have been in way to many B movies to count, and finally landed a decent roll that they filled well.But let's be honest, who gives a rat's ass about the actors. It's all about the Transformers. And boy did they look frikin sweet. I don't think I've seen better CGI. The action is seriously intense and just plain mindblowing. Applause Applause.The comedy is good but in my opinion there was a little to much of it, but at least it wasn't cheezy comedy. Overall the movie is definitely not just made for the Transformers geeks, its for everyone. There are some easter eggs in the movie that only Transformer fans will get, but it will not ruin the fun. Michael Bay didn't set out to make this movie to win awards, he made it for one reason, and in my opinion, the only reason that movies should be made for; entertainment. And Transformers does exactly that.","Jul 2, 2007",9,/10
"It seems sadly ironic that the film that kicked this blockbuster 'movement' off in the 1970s was based on a book, that film being Jaws. Since then we've had further blockbusters based on books; blockbusters based on comic books; blockbusters based on television programmes right up to the debacle that is the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy which was based on a theme park ride. Now, it seems, and with the imminent release of a 'G.I. Joe' film and a Transformers sequel, we have a new order: films based on action figures – is that the sound of a barrel base being scraped, I hear? It is additionally sad when a viewer must loose count of the product placement a film contains and must feel distinctly bored by impressive enough computer generated graphics, quite literally flying all over the place in slow motion and slamming each other into buildings and highways, but with which very little else is.In short, Transformers is a pretty terrible film; a film that sets up a scenario, provides us a MacGuffin, introduces relatively limp characters and feeds us bits and pieces of where it's going to go in relation to its story before just descending into near self-parody. I was ready for the film to end after about an hour and ten, but then I wouldn't have got to see Jon Voight very briefly break into a little sprint then later fire an assault shotgun at the latest in computer graphic software. I also wouldn't have got to see the final half an hour of out and out action in which there is a cut every other nano-second and characters, whom up to that point were only capable of realistic enough actions, get to slide off motorcycles under giant robots thus destroying them. I wouldn't have got to see another giant robot leaping over a kneeling girl in slow motion as we get acquainted with what her tonsils look like - then, when all the action has come to an end, there is a really, really God-awful payoff.The film takes time to set up young adult Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf), who is living with his parents, goes to high school and desperately wants a car because he thinks it will attract the attention of girls. Speaking of girls, there is a love interest in Mikaela Banes (Fox). Trouble is, we don't like Sam initially. His great-grandfather was an English explorer who, along with his crew in the Antartic, has that oddly familiar cockney English accent most American movies possess English characters with. How does Sam honour him? By selling the equipment and spectacles worn by is great-grandfather when he was struck down amidst the ice over a hundred years ago. Wouldn't you know it, he was finished off by Megatron – the leader of the 'evil' Transformers whom crash landed on Earth centuries ago.LaBeouf plays him with a sense of urgency, a neurotic style which, against all odds, actually works when the attempted acquisition of the spectacles has undergone on the Transformers' behalf. They need it because it tells them where something called the All Spark is located, and that is what the two robotic races want most. But if LaBeouf is passable, then the actress known as Megan Fox is the opposite. She is so magisterially awful that she defies words. The first time she even sees a Tranformer in the form of Bumblebee (aka LaBeouf's car that he purchases), she doesn't even react to it and carries the same, gormless look on her face throughout – she pouts her way through the film, delivering bad dialogue badly and just generally annoys you with her blank expressions.When we first see her, she leans over a car engine, slightly angelic via the music and gleam that radiates off her body she; is the very definition of objectification. The film is really nothing more than a teenage fantasy to do with getting caught in the middle of these two warring superpowers, and in this retrospect, it's nothing much more than Alien vs. Predator but with a love interest – both film's catalysts even took place many decades ago in the snow and ice. How can a film that cost so much and that has so much going on, visually, be so damn uninteresting? It doesn't want to make a commentary on how the new order to do with fear of North Korea and China is in place whenever an 'attack' on U.S. forces occurs; it's not bothered about robots as pieces of modernity and how they can be used well but also misused: it's all about the attractive, faceless female and the big explosions and the awe of it all. This was $150,000,000 spent on absolutely nothing.","Apr 1, 2009",4,/10

"I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations for this movie when I first heard about it ... then the trailer shown before Shrek 3 intrigued me. My boss got to see a sneak preview the night before full release and he talked me into going with him tonight (it was good enough for him to go see again!) Are the special effect believable? ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY!!!!!!!I caught myself driving home, looking at every vehicle, wondering what if ... The effects folks did an incredible job of making this look authentic and completely feasible! They should be nominated for, if not win an Oscar! As for the plot - there were some glaring holes, a few real leaps of faith in terms of suspension of disbelief, a few too obvious product plugs, but all in all, I would definitely say it was a WHOLE LOT FUNNIER than I expected, many moments when the whole crowd laughed out loud!Some couple brought their 6-8 year old son, that boy is going to be SCARRED FOR LIFE! There are some INTENSE moments in this film, folks, in terms of combat ... and some dialog which is going to take those parents months to explain, and it has nothing to do with robots, more along human anatomy and physiology.You'll need to see it more than once, there is so much going on, that I felt like my eyes hurt trying to take everything in ... I plan on seeing it at least once more in the theaters!","Jul 3, 2007",8,/10
"I'm sorry... but you have to be kidding me. The Transformers movie was bad! The transformers themselves were fine. I don't think they needed to be that true to the original. But the story and the story telling was horrible. My friends that watched it with me kept telling me that I expect to much from an action/sci-fi movie. That's not true. I'm not expecting an Academy Awarding winning movie, but there are plenty of action/sci-fi movies that do much, much better in the story telling department. The comedy was fine, the visuals were amazing, but the story was awful. Even the original cartoon movie did a much better job telling a story. Want some examples of action/sci-fi movies with cartoon/comic book origins that had good stories... The Matrix, Xmen 2, Sin City, Spiderman 2, Batman Begins. Other great action/sci-fi movies...: Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, Alien, Terminator 2...etc. It can be done. But we got classic Michael Bay.... Here's another Razzie nomination for you... I think it's your forth.I just think that they didn't give one bit about a story. I'm not asking for much. I know that a decent story can be thought out for a big clumpy movie like this. I think of The Incredibles. A movies made for children.. but it was great! I just hate Hollywood cookie cutters. I don't like it when audiences are not given any credit to appreciate a good story. They think we are stupid and will enjoy crap. The sad part is that they are right about the majority of people. I get mad. I keep hearing people say that it's the greatest movies they've ever scene. I want to walk up to them and slap the crap out of them.","Mar 29, 2011",3,/10
"TRANSFORMERS was worth the hype. It is a Summer popcorn action movie. And, as such, it delivers exactly what you want to see. There is humor, wild action, special effects, a story, a compelling main character and a well driven pace. Plus, it was just cool. In that, it reminds me of another fun film I saw recently called AWAKEN THE DEAD. AWAKEN THE DEAD is a wildly independent lower budget horror film but, like TRANSFORMERS, it delivers within the parameters of expectations. Go watch them both. And, while you are at it, check of the Vengeance trilogy by Park Chan Wook (OLDBOY, SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, and LADY VENGEANCE. Wook is a growing power in cinema. And, if you still need recommendations, check out LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD. Again, just for fun.","Jul 18, 2007",9,/10
"4 of 10 stars. This Movie is considered to be an extremely good Movie by many Film Historians, but it is not, it's a bad Movie. Look, sometimes a Movie is made where everyone involved put on good and/or competent Performances, and the Director does his job well, but we are still somehow left with a bad Movie. That is what I have here; everyone did their job fine, but the Movie is still bad.The special effects are fantastic, they still hold up 15 years later and were certainly tremendous for 2007, but it doesn't save the Film from being bad. Michael Bay does fine, he's a competent Director, and he Direct's this Film with competence. Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel star alongside Shia LaBeouf and Gibson and Duhamel deliver their Performances with competence, no problems there either. This was a huge budget Film, so there are a lot of heavy hitter's in smaller roles in this Film like John Turturro and Jon Voight; they do fine. Look, Turturro knew this wasn't a Coen Brothers Film, Voight knew this wasn't 'The Tragedy Of Macbeth', they knew what they were getting into, they knew what this Film was going to be. Having said that, they deliver the parts well, and they could've over-acted, but neither did, they deliver the part well. Kevin Dunn, Bernie Mac, Anthony Anderson, Megan Fox; they all do good and/or competent in this Film in their roles also.LaBeouf delivers in the starring role for sure, good Performance, bringing enough dynamics to the role without going over the top. Again, everyone does fine, the Directing is Fine, the sound effects are great, the special effects are wonderful...but the Movie is Bad. It happens.LaBeouf has often been a mess off the screen as we all know, but he's a very complex Actor; and many suggest that part of the reason he is able to peel the onion of the craft of Acting so deep on screen is because he's a mess off the screen, and there very well and likely may be some truth to that.What would Film Historians consider to be the 10 best Films that LaBeouf has starred in to this point of his career? I believe if I asked 100 of the most respected Film Historians around the World, there would naturally be different orders, but this would be their consensus; and they would consider the top 4 to be Masterpieces:1. The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019) 2. Honey Boy (2019) 3. Tru Confessions (2002) 4. Fury (2014) 5. Pieces Of A Woman (2020) 6. American Honey (2016) 7. Borg Vs. McEnroe (2017) 8. A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints (2006) 9. Disturbia (2007) 10. Transformers (2007)I disagree with that order, strongly; Tru Confessions and Transformers in Film Historians Top 10?!? Really?!? Not me, I don't think so. Who am I to disagree with Film Historians? But...here is my Top 10 Films starring Shia LaBeouf, and I consider the top 6 to be Masterpieces:1. Honey Boy (2019) 2. The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019) 3. Fury (2014) 4. Borg Vs. McEnroe (2017) 5. American Honey (2016) 6. A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints (2006) 7. The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005) 8. Pieces Of A Woman (2020) 9. Lawless (2012) 10. Constantine (2005)","Jan 22, 2022",4,/10

The acting was just great, real crisp, the story wasn't deep but enjoyable and the action... well...this movie just says MICHAEL BAY all over. PLEASE don't listen to the hard core fanboys and bay haters, they are seriously missing out on the best experience of their lives.This movie will make you laugh and just stare in awe as you witness the best movie in many years.If you enjoy popcorn munchers like badboys 2 and Armageddon (all bay's)and others then this will surely blow you away.

"I waited for months for this movie to come out and I expected A lot from it. And it wasn't my fault doing so, before it came out two of my favorite directors, Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay said: ""This movie is going to blow you away"". I mean, they're Michael Bay and Spielberg. Also the trailer was amazing, giving the feeling the movie is going to be a cool, action packed, serious movie, and not like an episode from the cartoon. And it DID start as an awesome movie; a helicopter that was supposed to be a wreck comes out of nowhere, transforms and attacks with incredible visual effects. The next robot scene with the scorpion robot was also awesome, and until that moment I was so glad that I finally have another movie which I can buy and watch over and over again. But when the robots started to talk, things started going down. They lost all their coolness thanks to stupid conversations, the visual effects got somewhat worse and there came a moment where the camera just started moving around too fast to hide the flaws in the visual effects. And worst of all, Michael Bay HAD TO put his classic cheap humour from ""Bad Boys II"" or ""Pearl Harbour"" to this movie as well. I'm sorry but, most things robots do or the guy says is not funny, they're just boring parts to make the movie look longer. And HOW did Bumblebee start talking again? I thought it was only in ancient Turkish movies where people recover from major handicaps by getting hit by a car, blind people start seeing, deaf people start hearing. There's also a part which I looked up in the Goofs section but couldn't find it. When the robots were asked how they learned English they say ""from the internet"". But they had to come down all the way near a car store and look at the vehicles to analyse in order to disguise like them. Why didn't they just check the internet for incredible amount of information about any type of vehicle? I never like looking for mistakes in a movie and I try to enjoy as much as I can but, this is just humiliating the audience. Definitely less than what I expect from Michael Bay. Nevertheless I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 cause the good scenes are REALLY good, and they manage to make the movie a ""must-see"".","Nov 9, 2007",8,/10
"After finishing watching Transformers, I was at the same point I was about two hours into the movie: I stopped caring. You aren't supposed to expect much considering the whole trailer was basically a bunch of super robots banging the metal out of each other and the fact that Michael Bay directs adds nothing to it either. Still, I felt that it could be a decent film, and it wasn't. Shia Lebeouf is superb and I hope he has a great career, but even he can't hold this together. Meagan Fox is in this only because she is smoking hot, and pretty much every other character is underdeveloped or completely obsolete. Let's face it: this is all about the robots and watching Optimus Prime take on Megatron. I am not an action movie fan, but even I can appreciate the special effects here; they are truly astounding. Still, there is no story and did I mention this is almost two and a half hours? That is way too long for any action movie, much less one with so little a story. Those who are fans of the toys love it, but those who expect more out of their cinematic experiences should move on to bigger and better things.","Apr 9, 2008",5,/10
THis was a great movie for kids 11 and older do not take your kids to it they talk about a lot of sexual humor .When i was at the theater other parents brought totalers to this movie.It also a scary movie for 5 and under.It did not have any blood or gore but some scary moments.Also no strong language except for in the beginning. this is a wonderful movie it is worth the price to see i would give it 3 out of four.If you are going to the theater don't see any other movie see Transformers ! Micheal bay directed this movie phenomenally it is definitely the best movie of his career.The storyline follows the video game and is such a great movie.On your way to the theater make sure to stop at a gas station so you can sneak in some candy.,"Jul 4, 2007",9,/10

"Great, Superb, Mindboggling, Have to see it, HOW COME YOU!! Haven't SEEN IT, these were the kind of responses I got from my friends when I asked them about this movie.I HAD TO scale up my expectations and expected nothing less than what they said about this movie.THANKFULLY a couple of hours before I met one of childhood friends, and he was one of the people with whom i have hours and hours of transformers, we were particularly fans of the movie and watched it numerous times, NOT Surprisingly HE SAID THE SAME THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE..............................BUT THEN ADDED SOME MORE.""Dont expect an epic battle between the robots, prepare to be confused as to who firing on whom and who dies, Megatron death isn't exactly epic either, AND THE CHICK IS SMOKING HOT"", his words were a wakeup call for me, immediately my years of blockbuster experience kicked in and I had a new idea about what to expect from this movie.Expectations are the key in this movie and this was what i expected.1)Loads of cheesy dialogue, not all the pleasurable kind, but the kind that will instantly clog your arteries.2)Loads of plot holes, a few of the kind that will instantly hit you, and most that will realise when someone else tells you about it, or you ponder over the events of the movie.3)Total and complete demographic appeasement, America means the world, the mandatory black and jap soldiers, the courageous soldier who dies, the president,the chocolaty boy, the hot girl etc.4)The 2 hour plus length so as to fully incorporate the funny, romantic, action, drama etc etc scenes.5)The creative liberty with the original storyline, and this case since the transformers themselves were created to promote toys, loads of product placement.5)AND MOST OF ALL THE MIND BOGGLING SPECIAL EFFECTS.I was right on all counts save for some minor inconsistencies, it wasn't the president but the chief of something, the dialogues were not only super cheesy but some scenes like the capture of bumblebee was was brain hemorrhage, AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE NOT ONLY MIND BOGGLING THEY WERE DIZZYING, SINCE HARDLY A PENNY WAS SPENT ON THE ACTORS MOST OF THE 150 MILLION HAS GONE IN CREATING EFFECTS THAT WILL CERTAINLY LIFT THE Oscar, and so overwhelming were they in fact that for the entire duration of the movie you forget all else and are completely mesmerised.You could actually feel the impact(helps when your in a great theatre) and couldn't help but be blown away by loads of the scenes,the scorpion chase scene was actually scary.Megan Fox was not only smoking, she was one fire, i almost had a Heart attack when i saw her sliding onto Shias lap. BESIDES THE Occasional BUT periodic CHEESY SCENE SHE WAS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD DISTRACT YOU FROM THE SPECIAL EFFECTS.Technically this film was superb as indeed it should be, there is no doubt, that this movie has taken CGI to a new level.Humour was a major plus point and the diverse nature of the jokes were the other high point in the film.In all a highly flawed film, BUT ONE THAT EXCELS IN ONE DEPARTMENT SO MUCH that it makes this WHOLE MOVIE completely enjoyable throughout.Please watch this film BY PAYING PREMIUM RATES IN A GOOD THEATRE (said it after a long time), just do it with the right expectations, just don't expect Godfather type cinema.-s loads of SUPER CHEESY SCENES, tons of plot holes and flaws, unepical final battle (budget, demographics, and test audiences maybe?).+/-s typical blockbuster.+s SPECIAL EFFECTS, SPECIAL EFFECTS, MEGAN FOX, SPECIAL EFFECTS, MEGAN FOX, HUMOUR, MEGAN FOX, HUMOUR, HUMOUR, SPECIAL EFFECTS......total 8/10 (i had so much fun anything lower would have been a crime, at the same time there is no doubt this movie could have been much better, some of the cheesy scenes are still vivid in my memory, (must not ramble about the i see good in the humans scene and the human taking down a Decepticon when armies could not,Megatron came thousands of years ago to use earths machines in the fight on Cybertron hmmm i can see how bullock carts would take down Optimus Prime etc etc).","Aug 22, 2007",8,/10
"This film will make guys wonder why dramas are even a movie genre, and females (and most males) will appreciate the witty script and great performances by LaBeouf, Julie Dunn, and Kevin White (the latter two play parents of the young human hero). A few plot holes (if the All Spark is raw power, then why the lame ending to Megatron and Prime's battle?) will anger ardent fans of the TV show, but everyone has known that plot holes are flaws of 98.9% of action movies since they were ten. The last battle is in crowded L.A., so the Transformers kind of blend in with the set design--watch it closely or you'll miss a few bullets. What also bugged me was the rapid camera pacing in battles; ten camera changes in seconds made it hard to determine the fights' progress. What would have made this movie great is if Bay didn't reveal the robots right away, adding to the movie a magic that made the child in most of us love the show in the first place. Great fun that will satisfy both sexes.","Jul 19, 2007",8,/10

The one in the bedroom between the Mom and Dad and the son. I think that those subjects should be left for parents to discuss with their kids. In my mind it didn't add anything to the movie.

"Michael Bay brings Hasbro's popular toy line to the silver screen in 2007's Transformers, a visually astonishing film hindered by unbalanced performances and questionable stylistic choices.For those of you who weren't a child in the mid to late '80s there needs to be an introduction. Transformers are beings which are not robots despite being mechanical. They are best described as humans made of metal. Each has a personality and an ability to ""transform"" into a much less interesting everyday device. This allows them to hide, and in the case of the film, gives some believability to their existence on Earth. Their home planet is at war. On one side are the Autobots, the honorable protectors of the galaxy. In this film's case, they appear to be sponsored by GM as each of them masquerades as a vehicle produced by the company. Fighting against the Autobots are the Decepticons. Their purpose is to destroy everything be it Autobot or human. Both sides are looking for a cube called the Allspark which can bring life to electronic devices. Just so happens that this device has landed on Earth and their eternal struggle for it is resurfacing in present day. When a lone Decepticon causes a stir in the desert by hacking the army's intel, the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight), must coordinate between Sergeant Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and a savvy technician (Rachel Taylor) to find the one human (LaBeouf) who unknowingly processes the key to finding the Allspark.Let's get to the strengths. Transformers is essentially The Terminator with different robots. This isn't a bad thing, as people are going to see this film just for the robots. LaBeouf's character is basically caught in a chase as he is protected by one powerful source while another pursues him. Most of the acting is strong. LeBeouf is especially strong as the lead. The special effects are not just contenders but a hands downs Academy Award winner if ever there was one. Few films in this decade offer visuals that are truly unique. We have all seen spells, ghosts, and dragons. Here we have a unique franchise that showcases vehicles changing into robots. These robots look absolutely incredible. Adding to their believability is the fact they are designed to be composed out of everyday materials. The artists of Transformers have recreated these materials using computer effects in a manner no other film has accomplished. To my eyes, cars coming to life with spot on real glass and polished doors, look far more real than any contrived squid or suited superhero because we are so familiar with these common items.Some of the best moments in Transformers are provided to please fans. Hearing the iconic Optimus Prime speak with his original cartoon voice-over supplied by Peter Cullen is a good move in this area. Having him pull double duty with an opening voice-over, subtracts from the impact that could have been when Prime first rolls onto the scene. There is plenty of Autobot on Decepticon action to keep fans happy as well, and the art design of most of the bots expands on the original toy line and cartoon without alienating them.I felt that some of the actors were playing roles outside of the film. John Turturro's agent Simmons struck me as a pointless agent of comic relief in a mostly serious film. His character's lines are so far from natural that I was confused as to whether or not he himself was a robot in disguise. That's the way comedy is supplied in Transformers. It isn't funny, it is just over the top and out of place. Most characters realize that there are dire stakes on the line while others are focused on being nonsensical. This isn't limited to actors, as one Decepticon (Frenzy), is wretched with sound effects, animations, and a corky voice; making it the most annoying digital character since Jar Jar Binks.This isn't the worst choice by director Bay in the picture, but it is tied with others for that honor. Rock music enters amidst action sequences which seconds earlier had a nice dramatic score. There are also several elegantly high concept shots, and some that leave something to be desired. These examples showed me a lack of consistency. This was very distracting because the tone of the film left me scratching my head. I wasn't sure if this was a comedy, auctioneer, or part drama. Transformers has an abundance of elements which are loosely tied together, and that is what makes it difficult to categorize and fully accept.Ultimately, the robot effects are hard to pass up when they are done this well, and no one is going to head to this flick truly expecting anything else. I have to recommend Transformers for fans of the toy line and animated series as well as anyone seeking stellar visuals.","Jul 2, 2007",8,/10
"The whole movie is nothing but explosions. The first 10 are cool, you can't just keep doing that the whole movie. The movie should have been no more than an hour and 20 minutes","Jun 16, 2020",5,/10
"I thought Transformers was really an enjoyable action packed film. The hot chick in to movie though was not the best actor. But I guess they tried to hide her bad acting skills with her looks. I thought Shia's performance was really good and how he stepped up in this major motion picture.The storyline is not hard to understand. They practically explain it in the beginning.The battle scenes were really good. Although at times it was hard to see what the transformers were actually doing, but it's really hard because of all the details on the robots(especially the fight scene between bumblebee and barricade at night).All in all it was a really good movie that I will be watching again and probably again1","Dec 24, 2007",8,/10
"For a movie about robots from space fighting, it's a drag to sit through. I know it has its fans, but that doesn't automatically remove its flaws. Also, why does the film focus more on crap lousy human characters more than the transformers? You know the characters that the film advertises and promises?","Jan 3, 2022",2,/10
"This movie was perceived and judged as bad when it came out but I secretly loved it. Such good action and special effects! I don't mind Shia as much as others, I think he fits the role well.It's cheesy but also very fun. It has some comedy and of course Megan Fox. The pacing is great, it's non-stop cars and robots transforming! Entertainment at its best. Bumblebee is very lovable.Just watched ""Transformers: Rise of the Beast"" and wow, it makes this one award-winning level.Highly recommend this original classic, it's the best in the entire series! ""Bumblebee"" with Hailee Steinfeld is a close second. That one is a surprisingly heartwarming Transformers movie and I recommend that one as well.","Jan 13, 2024",8,/10

"I was sitting in my home, watching the Simpsons. Nothing to do, my mother suddenly came from office, and said, ""Let's go watch Transformers"". I wasn't interested at all, seeing the original cartoon. After a lot of thinking, I decided to go. I came from the Theater and I was awestruck. It really is the BEST movie of all time, Batman Begins being the second. It was mindblowing how those Special FX people pulled it off. Kudos to Michael Bay, the director, the cast, the crew, and Mr. Steven Spielberg, the executive producer. Those two titans are the reasons that these movies work. Can't wait to see the sequel. Keep up the good work.","Jan 8, 2008",10,/10
"This film was fine for the young male adult audience. Megan Fox is there as the hot sex object, Shia LaBeouf was fine as the protagonist and the special effects for the Transformers looked really good. The movie obviously had a big budget and the CGI looks really good for effects produced nearly 10 years ago. Sound and score were great as was the camera work. The pacing of the story is so fast, every line of dialogue is delivered at break neck speed. The story is pretty banal & some of the visuals with all the army stuff are a bit cheesy although I think that was what they were going for. The army crew in Qatar are perfectly ethnically diverse which i thought was funny. The level of product placement was pretty bad, lots of cars, ebay, etc. Overall a decent movie, better at least than the many sequels which followed.","Dec 27, 2023",5,/10
"This Michael Bay summer flick or rather blockbuster is simply one of a kind that will stand as an example for generations to come. The movie not only depicts a pop corn summer flick with loads of action, thrills and fun but also has layers of Transformers mythology about to be discovered. As Michael Bay's all movies are this one is huge too, by far the biggest at that time.This movie can turn anyone into a fanboy for ages to come.

"It was my first meeting with Transformers being 32 years old. I can't understand why so many ppl rate it 10/10, it is beyond reason. Mind you, I loved ""Batman Begins"", I admire ""SinCity"" and I liked ""300"" or ""Spiderman"" for example, but this film is barely passable in my opinion.Graphic - great, very realistic; Action - a lot of; Music - OK; Acting - very little; Thrill - very little; Story - none; Twists - none; Brain activity - none; Cliché - to much to bear !Call it a film and rate it 10/10? It is a blasphemy, an insult to all good films and film makers ... People wake up !!","Sep 7, 2007",5,/10
"The Transformers characters look so true-to-life, and their interaction with the humans is quite remarkable. I am desperately awaiting the sequel to this (please keep it going Michael Bay!!!!!!). Do yourself a favor, get the video game. It keeps me sustained until the sequel of the movie comes out. In the game, you can choose to be an Autobot, or a Decepticon; and you can save your game and go back and forth between the two sides. I grew up playing with the toys. I had Megatron and Starscream. My parents saw the movie, and they didn't understand it. The movie doesn't appeal to them, cause they were too old to know the Transformers, like my generation and younger understand.My favorite character from the movie, is BumbleBee. I was hurt to see how easily Starscream injured him. I did, however, enjoy the attitude that Starscream displayed toward Megatron, when Megatron asked him a question. My favorite Decepticon, is Blackout. He made one hell of an entrance. I was disappointed to see the Soundwave didn't come to earth; hopefully he'll come in the next movie. Optimus Prime was right on from the cartoon! He's still a great leader, very responsible and thoughtful. He even showed sympathy toward his nemesis, Megatron. A great movie for children of all ages, unless you are too old to know what a Transformer is!!!!!","Oct 14, 2007",10,/10
"Okay here's long and short of it. Transformers is a terrible movie that seemed to get a blood donation from the greatest hits of bad movies over the last twenty years. The aroma of Godzilla, Independence Day, and yes, Batman and Robin makes it presence known by way of helter skelter editing, unearned buffoonery from the characters and a perfunctory plot lost in the computer blur. Even the famous ""One shall stand and one shall fall"" line from Optimus Prime is robbed as Bay chooses to focus on dorktastic Shia Lebouf as he tries to evade artificial laser blasts while good 'ol Optimus fights.This is the type of directorial choice that seem to lather the film in soda pop. I mean, the humans had Megatron locked in ice and all they could do is run around like children while this wire robot, possibly the ugliest robot I've ever seen, turns and looks at the camera and says ""Melting!"" in a baby giggle. Who likes this cybernetic nonsense? I cringed when I heard Optimus Prime say ""My Bad."" The robots didn't even have any identity to them. Their designs looked like someone detonated a car engine and put a boom box on top for a head. I couldn't identify with them at all and the constant whizzing around them done by the camera didn't help. Only Optimus Prime stood out as an anchor in the film as voice actor Peter Cullen provided gravely weight to the robot's presence. You only wish the robots were better formed and had more purpose. In fact you could say that about the whole film. The feature is like one of the robots in reality. It is a loosely connected set of gears that only on occasion transforms into a watchable film. The things that stick are the base level pleasure groans that come from both the robot wrangling and watching Megan Fox whip her hair around and gasp.What I would like to know is how come movies with such obvious defects, the robots when fighting looked like a ball of tin foil, can make such huge numbers and have so many people willing to forgive its immaturity?This movie seems perfected for the under 18 teenage crowd. Every adult is a simpleton and every great-grandfather is a heroic explorer. The adults, even the president, must rely on the super smarts of the sassy teenagers invited to the pentagon asked to decipher an alien language like a father asking his kids how to reboot a computer. One blonde chick in particular typified the computer hacking, code breaking fashion models that gave the adults a run for their money. The fat black kid is there as a throwaway joke, but also is a computer expert mind you. Everyone relies on a wee-wee joke in order to diss someone else, even the robots! Except for perhaps Bernie Mac who actually is kinda fun the B actors seem to all be stereotypes including the two military guys who dive in head first with machine guns against metal aliens that can throw lightning! The president is an old sage of course. The secret ops fellas knew about transformers all along and *of course* based all our technology off of them, which serves to explain how we could find the right caliber bullet to knock them out. The cube that gives transformers life can, implausibly, turn cell phones and other goodies into robots, which was *of course* a buildup into showing all our favorite brands turn on us in fun ways.The film is commercial through and through, loaded with references that seem to have been recommended by a mall shopping thirteen-year-old. For this, the stuck up human characters and the aforementioned hack job done to the robot's designs the movie feels like you're watching a bunch of teenagers give the play by play while King Arthur battles for the holy grail in the background.The sad thing is that I actually read the script to the Transformers and although I was poised to dislike it being that I am an admitted fan of the cartoon I actually saw some promise in the script. I felt that the script relied heavily on the humans, but I was willing to forgive that since I knew that the movie would be star heavy and the producers aren't going to risk the capital. That aspect kind of downed me overall but I set aside my hopes for what was on page. The script read a lot like ET, except instead of the boy encountering a scared alien he is befriended by warrior bots from the stars. The script ends like the movie, with Optimus sending out a beacon to other transformers. But when I saw the film and when that final scene rolled up, Peter Cullen's voice sounded exactly as I imagined it in my mind, except for the rock music placed over it, and the ugly paint job on Optimus, and the kiss between nerdy Lebouf and Fox that made me think she must have had her brain zapped by the energon cube, and all the slo-mo's of hicks on a farm, and did I mention the rock music? It was the sugar crystals of excitement loaded onto the film that did it for me. The artificial, eye grabbing, vomit of color and bombs and electric music laid at the feet of mousy actors is what spoiled what could have been a triumphant confrontation between million year old robotic foes.","Jun 30, 2009",4,/10

"As i kid i never liked transformers or really ever associated about them. So, when i first heard about it, i thought it was going to be some stupid movie. But then as trailers went up i got interested. Eventually, when i saw the movie it was the movie that changed the summer movies. I never really heard any really hype about it till it came out and blew any movie disappointed i had.I don't see anything bad about the acting or the story at all. It was complex or anything. It got the point and had amazing action in it. It also had comedy which was appreciated too. You need to watch this movie.","Aug 10, 2007",9,/10
"For all those who don't believe this film is good, think about the tight line the director and scriptwriter have to tread when creating a film with such a steeped history and so many fans. Ill make my point very clear this is a recreational film, its for pure enjoyment. Don't criticize this film for a poor plot line and tedious characterizations because it was not made as a dramatical feature presentation. It was made purely to wow audiences with special effects and tell a story that is about 25 years old. You couldn't expect much from a plot line that old.I agree the film has many plot holes poorly developed plot twists, but you have to take the good with the bad. This is a recreational film for not only those who grew up with this beloved cartoon/comic but everyone who likes a bit of action a special effects once in a while. For the the die hard fans it certainly pays homage to the original cartoon even using the original names and vehicle types of the transformers(Deceptacons and Autobots). Those of you who are thinking of watching this film, please watch this film without any expectations, a neutral outlook on its various cartoon predecessors, and just a little bit of background knowledge on what the films about(... and I don't mean a full history). The less you expect from this film, the more surprised you will be.","Aug 6, 2007",9,/10
"I could write all day about the things I didn't like about this movie. Not since Van Helsing have I so looked forward to a movie and been so let down. I guess I knew this movie would be kind of aimed at kids, but I didn't expect it to be nearly this juvenile, corny, and downright shallow. From the annoying autobots to the overblown special effects to the cardboard characters, this movie circled the drain for about the last hour and a half. Easily the most disappointing blockbuster of the summer. Even the special effects, while incredible at times, were just too saturated. Many scenes features battles where it was impossible to tell the robots apart, and while explosions are cool we don't need to see one every 3 seconds. And how does a 1,500 pound car ""transform"" into a 30 foot robot? I know it's science fiction but let's try to keep a tiny bit of realism...","Aug 19, 2007",4,/10
"First of all id like to say that growing up i only saw a few episodes of Transformers so when i went into the cinema iwas still a bit hazy about all the characters and story lines.Now id like to tell u that this is one of the best movies of the year. The director Michael Bay keeps the action flowing mixing it with a cheeky script. The CGI is top notch as you would expect and the acting is spot on. The voice acting is also very well done.The autobots led by Optimus Prime come Earth to destroy the All Spark which the Decepticons led by Megatron are after. Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) gets caughts up in the action and is joined by a fantastic supporting cast which includes Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas), Anthony Anderson (Scary Movie 4), Jon Voight and Rachel Taylor.

"http://www.parcentertainment.comhttp://framerate.blog.comJuly 4th weekend just wouldn't be the same without some over-hyped movie blockbuster with a whole lotta action and very little plot. And this year proved no different with the release of Michael Bay's Transformers. I have to admit, when I first saw the teaser trailer for this film over a year ago, I thought to myself, ""You have to be kidding?"" First, I didn't even know the Transformers were still that popular. Sure, I owned the toys when I was a kid. I watched the cartoon. But I wasn't sure if the young whipper-snappers of today's generation had a clue about Transformers. Second, I just didn't think that a film adaptation of the Hasbro action figures would be worth my while. And so I went in a skeptic, only to reemerge some two and a half hours later with a different opinion.Oh, don't kid yourself, the plot is VERY thin. This won't be an Oscar contender, but if you're looking for a lot of action with incredible special effects and a lot of destruction, then this is your film. Let's begin the review with the high notes: 1. SPECIAL EFFECTS - I have one word here: UNBELIEVABLE. With today's digital technology, a film's special effects will always come under close scrutiny, and it's difficult to claim that a film's special effects are revolutionary, like, say, Star Wars. But I have to say, the robots in this film look incredibly real. The detail of each Autobot and Decepticon is remarkable. Very well done indeed.2. SOUND DESIGN - These sound designers deserve a lot of credit. I know it's tough to shell out money at the theatre these days, but if you can dig deep enough into your couch cushions, I would highly recommend that you do so. Scrape up enough cash so you can catch this one in the theatres where you can really appreciate the sound.3. HOT GIRLS - Megan Fox. Wow. She plays opposite Shia LaBeouf as the sexy love interest. Let me just pause right here to stand up and applaud the casting director. Tip of the cap to you, sir.4. ACTION - If you want to see a lot of property destruction, explosions, giant robot fight sequences, and car chases, then pull up a seat and enjoy yourself. This one is action from the get-go. It's as if the studio exec's took a look at the first draft of this screenplay and said to the writers, ""Okay guys, all this exposition here? Pages 1-21? Just cut all of that out."" And now for the criticism: 1. LAME DIALOGUE - The Decepticons (AKA, the Bad Guys) never speak English. They speak to each other in their own alien language, which is translated for us via subtitles. This made them seem more ominous and gave the film a darker tone, which I enjoyed. Then the Autobots (AKA, the Good Guys) started speaking. Big mistake. They speak English throughout the film and their dialogue is extremely lame and stifled.2. COMIC RELIEF - In one particular scene, the Autobots are trying to sneak around the exterior of a house without being detected, but their antics resemble something out of Three Stooges short. They knock things over, they break things, they stumble around. They utter things like, ""My bad."" The whole scene came off childish and annoying. Many of the gags were forced and predictable, and there was no shortage of over-acting.3. CONFUSING FIGHT SCENES - Although the fight scenes between the robots were incredible, characters were often too close to the camera. The bodies got so jumbled together, it was hard to distinguish the good guys from the bad.I left the theatre with a good impression of the film. Yes, it definitely had its weak points, but your reaction to the film will definitely hinge on what type of movie you're expecting before you walk into the theatre. If you're expecting a well thought out story with wonderful dialogue and deep characterization, then you'll be in for a big disappointment. If you're looking for mindless action with great special effects, then you will probably enjoy it. Just remember, there's more to this film than meets the eye.","Jul 30, 2007",5,/10
This movie will be the best that Michael bay has ever done he has good classic but I respect his style and his humor but he deserves it and i think he did a good job on film and the CGI it's perfect But there something's that I didn't like and it's the term EXPLOTIONS I mean it's cool as a little kid but as you grow up it starts getting old but he deserves this one.,"Jun 30, 2022",9,/10
"Let me be forthright: this is an 8/10 on the entertainment scale, coming from someone who as a child, rented the original animated series over and over again every time his parents took him to blockbuster. This is not an 8/10 quality movie, but it gets that rating because it might be the most visually entertaining movie made to date.I remember nearly fainting when I saw the first teaser for ""Transformers."" That shock and awe factor certainly plays a huge role in enjoying this movie. If you thought Michael Bay made explosive movies before, try adding CGI to the mix. On the eye candy scale, we're talking the equivalent of Belgian chocolate here. Seeing the transformations happen and being teased a little more with them each time generates all the audience interest this film needs. Those who dislike Bay's over-explosive style will find more to critique here, but in all honesty, the man does a fine job giving us the entertainment we paid for.More interestingly, the trick that writers Robert Orci (""Mission Impossible III"" and Bay's ""The Island"") and Alex Kurtzman have to pull of in this film is immense: take a film concept greenlit for entirely action and commercial-oriented purposes and legitimize it as much as possible with a plot. Even though it's obvious how hard they try, they deserve props for even making it somewhat feasible. For example, they try and swing it that the discovery of a frozen Megatron in the '30s is responsible for all our modern technology since because they studied how he worked. Hey, it's creative.The background info, which is given to us outright, is that the Transformers home world of Cybertron was destroyed by Megatron, leader of the Decepticons (bad guys) and the only device capable of creating new Transformer life ended up on Earth -- which no Transformers knew about until the movie started. The Decepticons want the device to create a world for them to rule and the Autobots (good guys) and their leader Optimus Prime want to destroy it so no evil can be done with it. Earthlings, who happen to be caught in the middle, have to suck it up and deal. Because no film would be any good with just machine characters, Orci and Kurtzman create Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf), your average teenager who gets sucked into the mess because as it happens, his great-grandfather discovered the frozen Megatron. He in turn sucks Mikaela (Megan Fox) into this mess because what fun is a guy running around getting hot and sweaty if he doesn't have an incredible gorgeous woman to get hot and sweaty with? Then there's a supporting cast that is so overkill it's ridiculous: soldiers, computer hackers/defense intelligence people, agents of a secret government branch, the list goes on. All that matters is they make the film barrel on like a flame-emblazoned blue mack truck.Then there's the attempt at humor, which succeeds when it isn't forced there and comes naturally out of the fact that there are giant robots hanging out in suburbia. Maybe the film's best non-action scene is when the Autobots go to Sam's house to get his grandfather's glasses and they attempt to hide from his parents. Otherwise, the humor is poor because with a film this plot and action driven, it only awkwardly interrupts the flow.The last mighty effort in the writing is to develop the thematic content. There's the idea of sacrifice and courage that come along with the hero's journey and are meant to please parents forced to take their children, but there's also the underdeveloped but interesting notion of weather humans are worth protecting as the Autobots do. That's rich with potential, but they don't sell us with it. But hey, we'll take the effort, because anything more than incredible visuals is icing on a movie like this.","Jun 24, 2009",8,/10
"I had been warned by a close friend that Michael Bay had directed some stinkers in the past namely Pearl Harbour and Armageddon. Not having seen either of these excerpt a small except of the attack scene in the former I was determined to give the film a fair viewing. I was pleasantly rewarded! Yes there are faults, the worst I believe was the extreme close up nature of most of the action sequences which rendered them at times confusing, but on the whole I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The dialogue for the first half of the film is actually quite amusing and at times downright funny. The main character Sam is very likable and his love interest very lickable! LOL (Couldn't resist).When the moment came in the heat of battle for the two to declare their love for each other it didn't quite happen, which was a relief, so my stomach contents were kept down nicely.Of course the story is preposterous, it's a film about robots from outerspace disguising themselves as everyday machines. A realistic plot line is not the order of the day here, and neither should it be. I thought the cast were all excellent in there rolls and whilst the film lasted way over 2 hours it certainly didn't seem like it. It moves at such a pace that in the brief moments of little action there is humour. I had to nip out to the toilet at a part I thought was going to be not so interesting and apparently missed one of the most amusing scenes in the film!So in summary, forget his previous, don't expect The Da Vinci Code, switch off brain and engage your fun chips. Enjoy for what it is, a fun, fast-paced, action adventure, roller-coaster ride of a film and other tired old similes. Great stuff!","Aug 8, 2007",8,/10
"I had high hopes for this one, more so when I read a couple of reviews from normally reliable sources, such as Empire magazine and Dark Horizons. Sure they made excuses for it being a big, bombastic blast of mechanical carnage and you could overlook the childish silly story.....Well I couldn't. And I am equally surprised to find seasoned reviewers who could. They left out the words bland and unengaging! The battles-particularly the slow-mo sequences in the city toward the end-were superb, although at times the hyper-kinetic moments in real time were far too overwhelming for the eye to take in at times. Roll on the DVD, as some of it needs to be watched at 1/8th speed!! But how on earth does a movie with a $147M budget and a certain producer called Spielberg ever get made with such wanton disregard for a story or script. It is inane; the human character's acceptance of these alien robots is so matter-of-fact; the ""reveal"" of the decepticons plot and the ""cube"" plain lazy. Even if the story is just an excuse to create mecha-Armageddon, you could have invested a little more time in making it interesting and reasonably more realistic than the effects themselves.Aside from the mega battle in the last 45 minutes, Michael Bay's credentials as an action director are also questionable. The Barricade/ Bumblebee car chase is a damp squib; poorly edited and just as it looks like it is about to get going- it ends as day turns almost immediately to night! It gives the impression that they have been chasing one another for an hour or so but could not be bothered to show us any of it. The look of the film is a total Bay-ism, that Tony Scott ""80's"" touch. Lots of sunsets and sunrises etc.Shia Lebeouf does a fairly good job of fleshing out his smart-mouthed nerd character who blossoms into the hero (is there any other in American Teenagerville). Megan Fox brings little to the movie other than some smoother curves to the robots sharper edged contours.The humour is very uneven, going from pleasing the average 10 yr old with visual gags- such as autobots playing hide and seek in the garden, through to Porky's style coming of age comments and swearing. Seeing as the Transformers scriptwriting duo are now working on the new JJ Abrams ""STAR TREK"" is causing me to break out in a cold sweat.Michael Bay riposte to Bruce Willis' recent childish verbal outbursts; stating his film knocks Die Hard 4 out of the park for action is like saying ""Pearl Harbour"" is better than ""Lawrence of Arabia""- both dealing with the subject of war, but doing so on different levels. My enjoyment of the final Die Hard was partially down to a lack of expectation- but at least they tried to give the silliness a sense of reality. Just because Transformers is based on toys and a cartoon should not start you thinking that story does not matter- just because you are throwing over $100M in FX at the audience.Its a shame to get caught up with the marketing push of the Hollywood machine. Unfortunately, it seems to be happening more often nowadays- even the actual critics we rely upon seem to letting us down as well. Perhaps I, and other more discerning movie goers, should look before we leap!Otherwise they will keep chumming the waters with this crap and getting us hook, line and sinker every time. Not that any of my comments will matter to Michael Bay as he sits on a mountain of money, smoking a fat cigar!","Jul 27, 2007",5,/10
"I'll admit it- this Transformers review is more than a month overdue. Certain details will not be discussed here due to my memory simply forgetting about them. But then again, is it humanly possible to forget the experience you had after watching Transformers? The movie featured everything- giant robots duking it out, a Secretary of Defense who can wield a gun well, the obnoxious Anthony Anderson, and a funny cheap shot at the President. What's not to love? Well, the lead characters for one. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam, a semi-geeky teenager who is just like everyone else- he wants a car, gets moderately good grades, and wants to get a girlfriend (the way he tries to get a GF, however, is not like everyone else). After getting good enough grades to warrant him a used car of his choosing, Sam and his dad go to a car dealership to pick out a ride. Sam feels a connection between himself and a heavily-used Chevy Comero, which turns out to be a robot in disguise. Soon thereafter, Sam meets a hot girl named Mikaela (Fox), a name that's more sophisticated than her character. She is, however, a brunette, so something's gone array. Sam and Mikaela have the stereotypical relationship where the guy tries all he can for the girl, who eventually falls for him.Now it's not like any of that really matters. The movie is all about the giant robots, even though the Sam:robot on screen ratio is nearly equal. The major draw for the movie is the Transformers, and they sure as hell deliver. Michael Bay, in typical good fashion, wastes little time in introducing the main players. After the Decepticons (the evil robots) attack an American base over in Iraq, Secretary of Defense John Keller (played magnificently by Jon Voight) alerts the nation on the problem and the bizarre situation at hand. Working under Keller are many people, including a blonde woman, to whom I ironically forget the name of. Anyways, she takes the invasion seriously, and investigates is illegally with her adviser Anthony Anderson! Meanwhile, to sum things up, Sam's car morphs into Bumblebee, an Autobot (the good robots). Not soon after, the rest of the Autobots come down to earth, led by Optimus Prime, a kick-ass version of Arnold Schwarzenegger, only in robot form. From here on, the Autobots and Decepticons wage war on each other. Both ""races"" of robots are trying to locate a cube, which holds the power to their world. Be warned: the fights feature some of the most incredible special effects you have likely ever seen. The showdown at the end of the movie is pure mastery.Transformers has been in release now for more than seven weeks, and it's domestic gross is over $300 million to date. That puts it on an elite list with Spider-man 3, Shrek the Third, and Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End as being the movies of 2007 that have reached that mark. Inflation, you may say? Correct, yet $300 mil is still something to brag about. That money can be drawn to the great effects in the movie and the mostly spot-on sense of humor the movie has (Sam ain't funny, everyone else is). I highly recommend seeing this blockbuster.Good) Ridiculous effects, amazing robot on robot fight scenes Bad) Lead humans: not necessary & annoying, sometimes poor script Anthony Anderson) Is he not in every movie out there?","Sep 2, 2007",8,/10
"Undoubtedly, ""Transformers"" presents some high-action sequences with amazing special effects, but there weren't enough of them to make the movie. The story follows a boy, Sam (Shia), as he discovers his car is a robot, and he's been entwined in a robot war that began thousands of years ago. Along his adventures of trying to control the chaotic, but good, robot team that's protecting him and helping him ""save the human race,"" he's run into the sexy Mikaela (Megan). The two, backed by their robot comrades, look for Sam's great- grandfather's glasses (which were encrypted with a secret message) and the ""cube"" (the key to earth's survival), all while trying to annihilate the (so to speak) bad robots. The movie poorly developed Mikaela, only leaving her to be a seemingly shallow girl that eventually follows for the dorky boy (Sam) that everyone hated-- however, her script was so weak that it doesn't matter what she does, she was really put in their for her looks. She comes into the movie as a lacking character and the movie ends that way as well. Oh, and of course, the movie had to make her have some sort of ""troubled past"" for her to add a little depth and ""Wow she is more than meets the eye"". It was so unnecessary though that it was just an eye-roller. Shia's character, Sam, is better developed and easier to connect with. Though the movie does well in many aspects, the fact that the Transformers are a children's toy does show through in the movie with corny parts that would make 8-year-old boys laugh, not to mention the cheesy little ""We protect"" speech at the end. The biggest action parts are at the end and the beginning-- look forward to those. However, the camera is s shaky and jerky that sometimes it's difficult to understand what's going on. 4 stars for the action.","Aug 11, 2007",4,/10

"Transformers, the title alone gives goosebumps of years gone by when I drooled at the toys and worshiped the cartoons. Did the movie stay true to the original storyline? Short answer. NO. Do not watch this film if you're expecting to see the Transformers of our younger years. Was it bad because of lack of ""authenticity""? Again, short answer. NO. But fan-boys would probably flog me for saying that.Michael Bay, and thankfully because of Steven Spielberg's involvement, made a winner here.The story is simple enough, it revolves around the battle of the Autobots vs the Decepticons in finding the ALLSPARK, the source of their life. It's like their creator of sorts. Somehow, by some miracle of cosmic magnitude, the ALLSPARK gets its way to Earth and our favorite robots found out. There are a lot of exiting moments, especially during the first moments of ""transformations"". There are also dull moments, like the part when everybody was looking for a certain object to find the ALLSPARK. Not everybody will get the jokes. And some scenes were really not necessary. The rest, as they say, you need to pay to know. This ain't no spoiler review.The acting was above average, but not Oscar worthy of course. Who in their right mind will expect Oscar quality acting at a Summer extravaganza that is the Transformers. Although, notable acting was done by Shia LaBeouf, who plays Sam 'Spike' Witwicky. Jon Voight and John Turturro were just doing the rounds on this one. Before I forget, Megan Fox is a, well, Fox. As if that isn't cliché enough.  You can tell they didn't even break a sweat. The rest, well, they were just there for the scenes where the robots weren't involved.As far as the Transformers' ""Transformers"" acting goes, kudos goes to Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. Prime as we all know, is voiced by Peter Cullen. The original, the granddaddy, the mastah. The rest of the robots shall I say, just looked really, really cool. I  hope the sequel shows more of the other robots' personalities, because this one certainly didn't.  And believe me, there would be a sequel to this.The effects, without a doubt, is the best special effects I've seen in any film. Better than all six Star Wars Episodes, better than the Spiderman franchise and better than The Lord of the Rings and Matrix trilogies. It's that good. Once you see the Autobots and Decepticons in all shades of light, you'll definitely know what I'm talking about.If there is such a thing as an SUPER POPCORN MOVIE, this is it. WATCH THIS FILM. In fact, I'm going to watch it again later.","Jun 29, 2007",9,/10
"It's pretty simple, really; this movie is about giant robots. Not giant robots as a metaphor for the dangers of unfettered technology or the corrupting influence of great power. Just giant robots. They tranform into moving vehicles and fight other giant robots. Some are good, some are bad; there's an explanation for why but it really doesn't matter. Meanwhile, the human characters run around and say stuff; the performances are all pretty good and provide a pleasant bridge to the next scene involving giant robots doing giant robot things. So if you like giant robots, you'll like this movie. If you don't like giant robots, why are you watching it?","Apr 20, 2009",5,/10
"First I have to say, get there early, or wait till the movie is old. We ended up in the extreme first row, so we ended up with neck pain from trying to see all the action...of course we couldn't...so we are determined to buy this when it comes out...plus, go see it again in theaters.What an incredible and entertaining movie! So action packed, and the original voices was a definite plus! I was surprised that my kids remembered the voice of Optimus Prime! This movie is full of super action, very intense, and the humor is fantastic. I do remember my kids afterwards complaining (a little) about how they changed some characters, but believe me, I know they completely enjoyed the experience. Anyone who watched this as a kid (or like me, mom) will completely enjoy this movie. The human characters were so entertaining and enjoyable, and the Transformers themselves were so great, and enjoyable.The few technical errors were not important, and never detracted from the movie experience! But my suggestion is go early to make sure you get seats where you don't need a chiropractor afterwards!","Jul 4, 2007",9,/10
"actually, it's below average, but i'm a great fan of transformers so i can't give it less than 5. good, solid effects, but that's it. actors are mostly bland. kid (labeouf) is OK, turturro was a pleasant surprise and refreshment and voight gives his standard solid act. everybody else are mediocre at best. script? what script? this movie shouts ""robot porno"", there are some lines thrown in here and there just to connect the ""action"" scenes. my guess is that spending big budget on cgi forced creators to make story as watery and mass-appealing as possible to get the money back. and they've made it. story doesn't make any sense, gets pathetic too often and is full of holes. in fact, EVERY single dialog mentioning autobots and decepticons has some plot hole. in the year 2007, i find that unacceptable. if you are casual watcher and want a fun robot movie, don't let my review affect you, this movie WILL give you expected fireworks. but if you are transformers fan, you would probably cringe with me over the fact that big studios can't invest real emotion and passion into something legendary and beloved as transformers are. shame.","Sep 21, 2007",5,/10

"Even without watching the movie , everyone knows how Iconic Transformers are and how popular they are and yup they are definitely cool, The movie was better than I've expected but not by a mile it was honestly great , the setting is good and the plot is great also but it feels a little bit shallow and sometimes it doesn't 100% make sense a lot of scenes could've been made better like the last 30 minutes it was a bit too chaotic when megatron wanted to get the CUBE and such it was a bit too chaotic to follow so thus it was Quite boring/hard to follow but that's what Michael Bay does , A lot of explosions similar to what he did in the ""Bad boys"" movies.What I really liked is the CGI the Computer Generated Imagrey has PEAKED in that time , the scenes were absolutely seamless when it comes to transforming the autobots from viechles to Gaint roaming robots I couldn't even spot a mistake in the production it definitely shows how Transfoemers has revolutionized the CGI aspect in it's movies.What's also very very good is the Voice acting in the Autobots , Espically Optimus Prime's voice actor , the accent and the lingo that he speaks is in so iconic I even knew it BEFORE watching the film which absolutely goes to show how iconic that voice acting performance is.Overall great movie with awesome CGI and great soundtrack and most of all very good voice acting and great plot and characters can't wait to finish the franchise , 8/10.","Apr 28, 2025",8,/10
"The visual effects, the sound design the humor were all undoubtly amazing. Shia Lebeouf acted great. Not all actors act great. They seem great just because the role given fits their original personality but Shia Lebouf ACTS great and convincing enough (both humor and action).Jush Duhamel fits the concept.Even Tom Cruise may not fit the movie this much. İt can easily be understood that he has given everything he has got to this film.Micheal Bay is always a super talented director but there are some leaks in his flawless carrier in Transfomers as the music in some scenes could have been better, and the actresses he has chosen (if he choosed them) could have been better. I mean Megan Fox is not hot. Thin body and mini-skirt doesn't mean hot. İt's the carefully measured movements that makes the leading actress seem hot. And Rachael Taylor cannot pronounce English in British accent although she over acts it.These are (not criticising a well rounded director as Michael Bay) just some humble and friendly wishes. May Allah give him opportunities to make better and more moral films. This is probably the best fantasy film of the year.","Oct 20, 2007",8,/10
"Seeing transformers at the movies was one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life. It was poorly shot, made little sense and I'm just not a fan of Shitloaf (Shia LaBeouf) at all. The presence of Megan Fox as eye-candy was probably the only upside, but there are better places to look for that than a bad action movie. I guess i was never a transformers fan anyway, but i doubt anything could really have helped this disaster. It even gave Spy Kids a run for its money as my least favourite film ever. If you find yourself in a position where you are being forced to watch Transformers, find a quick and effective method of suicide ASAP.","Aug 16, 2008",1,/10
"Went into this film with negative expectations, and left with the satisfying feeling of having watched something worthwhile and refreshing in the current political and social climate. For me the clinch point of the movie was its reliance on the comic-book genre, with specific set-piece 'storyboard' - style images accompanied with very few words - just like a comic.Because the story and the whole experience is centred on alien creatures, the performances of the human actors had to be subordinate to the supreme beings from outer space, and the director delivered this big-time.A greatly satisfying part of this movie was that it wasn't an all-American 'flag waving' exercise. Sure the robots were engaged in a battle obviously taking place in some US city, and the human heroes were clearly American, but it carefully avoided the normal cop-out involving multiple shots of the Stars and Stripes going into battle to vanquish yet another evil empire. In fact, in this film, it is the invaders themselves who, with the help of the humans, manage to provide the viewer with a very real sense of wonderment and appreciation of the movie for what it is - first-rate, engaging and surreal fantasy.","Dec 9, 2007",9,/10
"Transformers is a loud mess. It sparked a lucrative franchise, but the film is shallow and cluttered. First, the script is nonsense. Clearly, the writers had predetermined goals and forced a narrative around them. The vague MacGuffin, unreliable plot points, and muddled storylines only serve mindless action and cheap emotional manipulations. Besides the battles, there isn't anything here. Shia LaBeouf's charisma elevates his character, but even then, it's difficult for viewers to care. Ultimately, Transformers is a means to an end. Its sole purpose is to provide robots crashing into buildings, and that's about as empty as movies get.Meanwhile, Transformers is technically inconsistent. The significant (and occasionally practical) effects are a positive. The sound gets symbolic and the cinematography gets dramatic, but both are also chaotic and disorienting. Furthermore, during the finale, timing and spacing dissolve because the editing is incoherent. It's hard to know what's going on, where characters are, and how to feel. Plus, the soundtrack is forced, the production design is flooded with product placements, and the tone is erratic. Together, these aspects are distracting rather than immersive. Overall, some may like Transformers for its pointless excitement, but many will find it annoying.Writing: 2/10

"I braved the torrential rain last night to go see the UK midnight screening of Transformers. But the real thunder was inside the theatre.First, off ignore the snotty critics who have an issue with the premise. Anyone who goes to see a Transformers movie should be ready for metallic brawls and cheesy dialogue. The film gets off to a rip-roaring start, settles down into the story and closes with an extended smackdown between Autobots and Decepticons.The special effects are astounding and will surely bag an Oscar next year, whilst the main performances from Shia LeBeouf and Peter Cullen were brilliant. Fans will be pleased to see various elements in tact from the cartoon. Bumblebee and Sam/Spike's special friendship is the main success at the heart of the film. Also, the Autobot dialogue is pretty much lifted from the cartoon with Megatron and Prime taunting and exchanging dialogue during their climactic fight.The humour was spot-on although it felt more forced as the film got down to business. Typical Bay-isms were all present and correct, which leads me to my main criticism. The action was at times disorientating and hard to distinguish. Transformers dive past the camera so quickly that it spoils an otherwise flawless sequence.If anyone was left disappointed by the lack of Decepticon footage, then I'm sure the inevitable sequel will up the stakes. All in all, the film did exactly what it set out to do and I have no issue with that.","Jul 20, 2007",8,/10
"I like it a lot. It is very action packed. Not much more to be said, if you haven't seen it and like very 2000's war-like action movies I highly recommend. I have to say I would have liked to seen the autobots fight more.","Apr 27, 2022",8,/10
"I've always been somewhat of a fan of Transformers, manly Beast Wars and Beast Machines. G1 was a few years too old for my age group. (However, at around age 12 I began watching G1 episodes online) Anyway, I had been pretty excited for this movie from the get-go. It began when I saw the teaser trailer. Months later, I walked into the theater praying that this wouldn't be a 3.5 hour CGI induced headache. It wasn't. It actually had a very good plot line, excellent foreshadowing, AMAZING visuals, and pretty good acting. First: the plot line. When I first heard that there was going to be a Transformers movie, I thought, how would they do that? Well, they did it. The very first shot after the opening titles pulls you in to the main tone of the movie. I've explained that to the best of my abilities. Second: Foreshadowing. They pulled this off with impressive set design and fantastic locations that really gave the fantastic illusion to the audience that we are really facing an alien invasion with BA giant alien robots. Third: the visuals. Every shot had it's own art form. From the MH-53 Helicopter flying away from the Qatari sunset, from Megatron's gigantic Cryo-Prison. Along with that, they made the Transformations look real. You could see where every single part of the car was going whenever it turned into a robot. Fourth and Finally: the acting. When I saw this movie, I took note of the lines. I'm a stage actor, so I like to picture what the lines look like on paper. On paper, they look pretty dry. It takes a really good actor to take dry lines and make them serious, comical, and emotionally engaging. That's exactly what they did, especially on Shia LeBeouf's part. What he did with that script was just fantastic. Overall, you really don't need to be a Transformers fan to thoroughly enjoy this film. Although Transformers fans get more of a kick out of it by seeing they're favorite Autobots and Decepticons on the silver screen, (I got goosebumps every time I saw Starscream and Ratchet) it's still an extremely fun thrill ride for everyone else.","Dec 20, 2007",9,/10
"Michael Bay continues to barrage Hollywood with more 'hummingbird cinema'. Afraid of his audience looking away for even half a second, Bay uses a mix of explosions, CGI and rapid editing to ensure that nobody can take their eyes off the cinema screen.His total lack of faith in his two leading actors is realised in a nightmare of CGI and explosions which minimise the screen time of LaBeouf and Fox so that even they can not damage the film too badly.Unfortunately it's Bay's reputation that continues to take a battering on the back of his Transformers series, in fact he continues to take a battering on the back of every film he's ever touched. Seemingly unphased by the constant criticism he receives from industry experts and cinema-goers alike, you begin to wonder if Bay is in fact a robot himself.Why so many screenwriters are credited with the creation of such drivel I have no idea. The 'dialogue' within Transformers often has the feeling that a chimpanzee might have been involved in the writing process. A thorough insult to the hardworking writers of the film industry.Millions have been made off the back of this film and millions more will undoubtedly be made until we reach Transformers 162. When will this madness end? Nobody knows.If you're looking for a movie with real style, substance and a truly gripping plot then you've come to the wrong place. However, if you want to sit down for a couple of hours, switch off and listen to your brain cells die one by one, then this is probably right up your street.","Nov 8, 2012",2,/10

We were bumped up with action and we could feel our blood rushing around our bodies!! believe me if you see this movie for the first time it will get your adreneline going!!!. This movie not only is packed with action but also with its humour from the brilliant performed Shia LaBoeuf it will carry you easily through the 2 hours 10 minutes of pure movie magic. And when it does get to the end of the movie be sure to watch a bit during the credits. Many people had doubts with Michael Bay directing due to some of his previous movies but believe me, i couldn't see anyone else directing this movie and the franchise!! Well done Michael Bay, So watch transformers because you wont regret it!!","Jan 8, 2008",10,/10
"Transformers was always going to be risky; 'transforming' what started as a series of toys and an apparently beloved animated series into a film screams ""iffy!"" in any film buff's ears. Unfortunately, it is a case of wrong time, wrong place for this CGI soaked blunder of a movie. In a world with Jason Bourne, a new, far more brutal Bond and the Dark Knight, Transformers can't help but take itself seriously. In my opinion, this is the wrong choice. After sitting through over an hour of this drivel, I was pleading for some Robocop-esquire satire, but none came. Surprisingly, it was the performances that I most enjoyed. Le Beouf is suitably awkward and bewildered and John Turturro puts in a show stealing performance. Where Transformers falls down is on its metallic heroes. They are truly the worst cinematic creation since the human/alien/basically a naked sloth in Alien: Resurrection. The fact that they talk is a huge mistake, funnily enough it is the little yellow mute one that has the most character. None of the others summon even the smallest smidgen of compassion, and consequently, you couldn't care less when they get crushed by Megatron, a dormant Transformer who, waking up after a century or so's hibernation declares that he IS Megatron. Well thanks for the heads up. If Transformers just had the integrity to abandon it's integrity, realise that actually, yes it is a ridiculous idea for a film and have some fun with it, it could have been much better. Instead it's just boring.","Dec 4, 2008",2,/10
"In all honesty I never liked Transformers. I never watched the old cartoon. I got a few toys as birthday gifts but I never had the patience to make them fully 'transform'. The only attachment I really have with Tranformers is the old Beast Wars show, but that was only if nothing else was on.But I loved this movie.It's not perfect (it's a summer movie), but it's a rare summer movie that can beat you in the face with it's action sequences and still remain memorable. In all honesty it's a film that only Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg could make properly. Yeah the story isn't great, and the characters are underdeveloped, but it sticks to you anyway. And, really, when was the last time we saw a truly amazing huge-friggin'-robots movie? In my opinion Transformers is the best summer film of 2007, trouncing even my once-personal favourite 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. Michael Bay said he wanted to create a sort of 'family film with an edge' and that's more or less what this is. I can't imagine all the complaints he must have gotten when people were first introduced to the 'serious look' of a children's toy line. But that's really what it is. If your hoping for a scene where a Decepticon transforms, crushing a hapless human inside it's many moving parts, you'll be very disappointed. The violence mostly comes from the robot-on-robot battles, with relatively few on screen human casualties. The film itself is like the toys it is based off. You look at it and wonder how it's supposed to work, but in the end it just does, and it does it well.","Oct 21, 2007",8,/10

"Firstly, it wasn't my choice to see this movie. I would have seen Blades of Glory, Bridge to Terabithia or something like that. But it just happened that this was on at a reasonable time. I knew this was labelled ""good fun for the boys"" and me, being one who would rather watch girly romantic comedies or just a comedy itself, i was doubtful. It exceeded all expectations... it was funny (really funny) and rather action packed (but since i enjoyed casino royale then i don't mind a bit of action). The cast was perfect, Shia LaBeouf (my new crush) just livened up the screen with his geeky retarded-around-girls Sam Witwicky. Megan Fox is not only gorgeous, but great for the role of Mikaela. And as for Sam's parents- who could choose better. The rest of the cast were great as well! Micheal Bay took on Transformers and made it a film to remember forever. Honestly it was funnier than most comedies that are supposed to be comedies I've seen and really, I was impressed.

It was FUN! I went in with no expectations except to see transforming robots brought to life on the big screen and that's exactly what I got.

Be ready for a disappointments.In this scene.The Decepticon completely own the human.Giving really you the chill that they are bad ass.But more we advance in the movie and more you feel they are just cheap Terminator bigger version.For example Magatron.In the comic he can blow out a complete city but he can't reach a 17 y o little human running away with the famous all spark.Megatron have to ask him! Can you believe that?Megatron . The doom of Cybertron ask the 17 yo punk the box.He don't attack him .No ,no,no !He ask him gently - Give me the all spark little punk! He's indeed Powerful.. no?This is how you feel when you watch the Transformers.Not to mention how it's seem quite easy to destroy them.At the beginning they seem invulnerable.But by the end, a little human can dispatch one with one shot sliding over him.OK .. You get it right?The acting and the dialogs was ... poor.The Auto-bot want to protect the human but don't care about the protection of them-self.They are just machine after all.These robot have been friend for millions of years but that OK dying for the sake of human who are still considered chimpanzee by the norm of the universe.You really don't believe in this.Simply because there's almost no character development in the Transformers.It's just a shoot-em-all. Like Rambo with better graphic.Mister teen Sam suddenly become a super brave soldier and give directive to the army.Hell yeah , We all know that a teen would be given the fate of this world on his bare hand . Why do we have army , scientist and powerful organization when a teen can do it all?When Optimus Prime said to Sam *You saved my life* .That when i started crying.My friend close to me started to cry also and we both laughed.Without mister 17 year old this world would be doomed.Not to mention how the robot are supposed just to give away their life for the chimpanzee since the start,But Optimus Prime got saved by the 17 yo little punk.He have to be grateful.That OK if so many civilians die during the city fight.That a lot of military die .That a lot of Auto-bot die.Because Little Sam is the boss here since he carry the all-Spark.We have to give the credit that he escaped a 50 ft tall robot who's considered the most cruel evil and powerful robot of the universe.Who was there for millions of years and rage war everywhere in the universe.SUper Teenager is here! You just can't believe everything.Even the story is unbelievable.It's so badly shaped.The girl that Sam love is indeed a super mid 20's top-model.She's Wise and perfect looking.I'm sorry but when i was 17.Girl of my class were not shaped like some mid 20's top model woman with the brain of Einsteins and the courage of James Bond.SPOILER A 17 yo guy standing by a 50,000$ sport car kissing that supposedly normal girlfriends teenagers was really the end that we wanted.Not only the robot surround him.The government don't care about them.The teen have the control.Sam got the Powah.I hear the beat in my head.OK , it's a sci-fiction movie after all.Don't you agree?The action is intense and the robot are well done.That all i think off when i think about what i enjoyed about this movie. If you want to see a movie with actually a story and a normal human that face the reality of this world.Go watch Spiderman III . You watch the Transformer for the special effect.That it.It's was like watching the same plot of Hercule in New-York using 150 Millions of Budget","Aug 18, 2007",3,/10

"When a movie is not as good as it could have been it's usually not the fault of the FX people. They deliver 99% of the time (when it's not low-budget). And it's usually not the fault of a seasoned actor if a movie is lucky enough to snag one. This movie snagged Jon Voight who played his role as a general or secretary of state (I forget which) straight as an arrow. Good for him. I only wish everyone else had done the same thing.Let me explain: I guess you could call this movie a ""sci-fi semi-comedy"" whose humor was largely supposed to be in the dialogue and the antics of an uncute mini-transformer . Trouble is, though trying hard to be, the dialogue wasn't funny and got on my nerves big time. Honestly, I had a border-line migraine from the unfunny chatter. There were at least 3 occasions (maybe more) where I can remember thinking ""Shut the f**k up, already!"" The principal offender was the ""Disturbia"" guy who seems to be type-cast 'cause he was doing his nervous, babbling, blundering when-I-see-a-girl-I-like and when-there's-a-crisis shtick. Somehow the pretty girl in the movie is always attracted to him and I seriously wonder why. Maybe they feel his constant nervous blathering is disarming and even cute; perhaps even flattering. They probably also figure that any man who is this tongue-tied and bumbling over a woman would make a nice pet.To help young Disturbia out with the unfunny chatter was a brief appearance (mercifully) by Bernie Mac who plays a fast-talking car salesman (Was this one of those times when I said ""Shut the f**k up?""). Now I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like the more success some comedians achieve the less funny they become; just not as sharp as the good old days when they had their ""A-game"" going on. Also on hand to help Disturbia (I don't know the guy's name folks) tank this movie was Anthony Anderson with more unfunny yak yak. (No memory loss here; I did say ""Shut the f**k up, already!"" to this guy on his intro.) Finally, parents take note: kids, because they tend to be less critical, would enjoy this movie more because of the cool machines and special effects. I myself would also have enjoyed this movie more if the rest of the cast played their roles as dignified and straight as Jon Voight. There was just too much unfunny motor mouthing going on for me. And the end of the movie reminded me of why I generally don't like war movies: too noisy and confusing. You know- Who's doing what to who, and why? Etc, etc, etc. KA-BOOM! CRASH! BANG! Aspirins, anyone? Love, Boloxxxi.","Sep 30, 2007",5,/10
"Unlike certain Harry Potter fans who can't seem to find enough imagination to critique this movie as it should, I found this movie to be the BEST big-budget movie of the year! You can complain about the smaller details (government representation, John Voigt) but the story was great (realistic as it can be) the CGI was amazing. I wasn't totally convinced of Shia L's abilities (being so highly touted), but you can definitely see how he can be considered one of Hollywood's up and coming. (Can't wait for Indy 4) Even John T. was enjoyable in the film. You don't even have to know anything about the '80s toys to enjoy this movie. Hot girls, hot guys, great cgi, great movie! A must see for this summer!!!","Jul 3, 2007",8,/10
"If you are a person who likes great paced roaring action adventures with a delightful twitch, watch THE TERMINATOR. A movie like this is like what I just mentioned. These are the elements Micheal Bay's TRANSFORMERS tried to desperately achieve. Let us just assumer Bay was a great director. Wait, lets think twice.The main character of Kyle played by budding actor Shia LaBeouf has he discovers his car which goes haywire and ends up to be a transformer. Halfway across the world in the deserts of Iraq, an American fighter and his crew are being terrorized by these monstrous robots. We then see reasonably well-done graphics pacing with the action as government officials try to track and stop this invasion.Transformers comes under the category of science fiction. It is quite possibly the most demanding genre to work on. Firstly, if it based on previous television series, comic books etc., fans want to feel the excitement and pace of what they've seen and read brought to life on the screen. Apparently, Bay isn't aware of this phenomenon. He throws in extreme graphics and choreographed camera movements to match the extreme graphics. Although the movie is a Spielberg orientation, it drifts away from the TRANSFORMERS everyone read. I was not impressed by what I saw in the theater. A Spielberg direction would have changed everything into a stellar great-one.","Sep 8, 2007",5,/10
"This is just the best movie that has been made for transformers.I was expecting a movie with a lot of talk and no action because of the complex computer animations this movie has but almost all the movie you will see great animations and also very good looking sport cars, a very good choice from the director.This movie has a great casting too, Mikaela Banes is better looking that Jessica de alba. I have seen 6 times this movie and i enjoy it every time i watch it , this movie just have become my favorite. I hope they release a sequel very soon.","Jan 6, 2008",10,/10
"When I came into the theaters to see ""Transformers"" two years ago, I didn't expect much. In fact I was turned off from the trailers at the physical appearance of the robots and I was thinking, oh great another shoddy remake based on my childhood memories, lowered down by Hollywood and its cheesy remakes. However after the movie was over, I had to eat my words. In the end I found the film to swift pass all that I expected. A loyal hats off to director Michael Bay for bringing this action thriller to life. In it's two hour and twenty duration, it was never once dull and the action is nonstop, just like the cartoon series from the 1980's. The backgrounds were beautifully nuanced and the human actors had a chance to shine and were not usurped by the giant robots. What adds to the atmosphere is that this action film has a very unique origin to it, the way a debut should always commence. The introduction wasn't rushed like in many action flicks as it provided enough depth to make is easier to follow and it flows through nicely. Even those who never heard or even watched transformers will be able to understand the story of their origins and how the war between the good Transformers vs. the evil Decepticons came about.The robots come off physically different and their characteristics light up the screen as each of them were highlighted splendidly. The CGI is at its very best here. Before anyone starts to quip about ""Transformers"", try to take time to realize that there are so many versions of Transformers featured on television for many years, with each one holding a different perspective to the franchise. I suggest you watch each of the series' pilot episode and you can clearly understand that they are all different from each other. This movie is another new series only this time it's transferred from the set to the screen.Don't be judgmental and just randomly put it down by saying it's stupid and not real. It's a sci-fi action thriller, it's not meant to be real. I would like to add this to my collection of movies as it's finally graced the screen to hopefully enlighten a new generation of fans today as to what it accomplished in the 1980's.","Mar 16, 2009",9,/10
I just went to go and see this movie today. From the second it started it was action packed! There was over 70 minutes of nonstop action. I never really got into the TV series. Seeing it live action was much better in my opinion. Every corner had something to laugh at too. The black guy that owned the car store was hilarious. As was Anthony Anderson! Every single black person in this movie was hilarious! Except for the Military guy. He was serious. But this film had great action and great laughs. This is one of the most funnest action films i've ever been too! Don't believe the haters. It's a very fun action film! I'm definitely going to get this on DVD when it comes out! I give this movie a 9/10!,"Jun 28, 2007",9,/10
"After finally seeing the live action movie based on a cartoon I watched and toys I owned as a child and reading all the reviews posted here, I must admit I am astounded by the highly negative and highly positive reviews, as the movie itself falls somewhere in between.The Godfather and Citizen Kane it is not. Nor is it as bad as all the fanatical fan-boy postings make it out to be (possibly still upset over how awful the Fantastic 4 sequel was). And frankly, we should move past a 20+ year old cartoon that hasn't exactly stood the test of time, falling somewhere between the Smurf's and He-Man & The Masters of the Universe).The movie is exactly what the vast majority of humans believe it to be before even walking in the theater; a big, loud, fairly entertaining summer blockbuster that will make you forget about the outside world for a little less then 3 hours.Is it cheesy in places? Yes. Does it make sense all of the time? No. Is it a giant commercial with lots of product placement? Yes, for Hasbro. Will it hold your attention long enough to give you your money's worth? Probably for 90% of you.The CGI is simply amazing, probably one of those big step forward moments in movie making that seem to happen every 10 or so years. The actors are serviceable; pretty people doing pretty things made to look ugly, but still with their hair neatly in place. The story is a formula you've digested many times before and will probably continue to digest in years to come. And the director, the oft loathed Mr. Bay, is not at fault here. He did after all put big explosions, a so-so plot line, and pretty actors in a movie about toy robots.I give it a 7 of 10, because it was entertaining from beginning to end and the CGI was impressive. But just remember before you settle into your seat for something deep, meaningful, and otherworldly; this movie is based on a cartoon based on a toy from the early 80's. If you are looking to make an emotional connection, a date with a stranger would provide you with better odds.","Jul 2, 2007",5,/10
"This was the dark horse of 2007. Nobody expected this to breakout like it did, but I think they underestimated the fanboys out there. Michael Bay delivers a good film, not a great film, but by his standards it's not bad. The action scenes are incredible, and that final hour is incredible to watch. Say what you will about Michael Bay but all his films look incredible. The story isn't grand and the character's can be quite annoying. The reason we're here is the action and to that point, it works. The series never reached these heights again, but this first film is well worth checking out.","Dec 7, 2019",8,/10
"This movie of kinda OK, I agree with this but the design. The model in this movie has NO sense of original G1 character design except color or maybe not.Overall the visual effect is great. They were great, no it is incredible. They might have a lot of effort making this film
the actor is not bad it fits
The plot is fast-going superfast it takes me 2-3 times to understand the movie.The only problem is just character ripoff
I agree that some character model is cool but some are bad like Megatron, the twins and the worst is wheel jack.Because:
Megatron- is from a Gun to a plane? Also, transform from a blocky guy into uh demon-looking guy? And give him visual effects.The twins- are trashed if I won't judge from design. The twins didn't have any relation in any previous takes on the series but their personalities are absolute trash. Both are great, one is being a theorist and one is a fighter? And got replaced with bad humor.Wherljack- Albert Einstein parody/ redesign in at worst way possible and also they add hair for some reason? Bro other designs don't have hair or are even human-like.","Feb 1, 2022",3,/10

Just go for it. You won't regret watching Transformers any way. In fact, this movie, the first one, in specific is the one which would appeal the most not only to Transformers fans but also casual movie enjoyers. It is just a overall fun time. The CGI is ahead of it's time, the action is up there and the plot is seemingly interesting. Afterall it is the reason why most 2000's Transformers fans are Transformers fans in the first place.

"At 2 1/2 hours, ""Transformers"" is a impressive movie with a lot of special effects. At stake is protecting whatever parts of Earth aren't destroyed in battles between warring metallic factions from outer space. The film starts off like an alien-invasion picture, telling the Transformers story as though it were ""Independence Day."" The new movie offers a much better time than that one.Transformers, of course, comprise the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons . Both factions are imposing robots who contort themselves to become machines like trucks and supersonic fighter jets. In a dicey bit of cross-promotion, the movie uses the occasion to hawk Hummers, Pontiac roadsters, and GMC trucks, which are some of the vehicles Autobots turn into. The Decepticons become ominous cop cars (""to punish and enslave"" reads the motto) and anonymous military vehicles -- more intimidating but harder to buy.In any case, they've brought the fight on their planet to this one. Both sides are in pursuit of a cubed life-force called the Allspark that in Decepticon hands could turn simple machines into robotic weapons of destruction. But there's a horny teenage boy unwittingly in the way. His name is Sam Witwicky , and to play this smart Aleck on a parental short leash, Shia LaBeouf seems just to have wandered over from the set of ""Disturbia.""Based on a line of Hasbro toys, Transformers puts the fun back into movie-going, blending comedy with the robot action and adding a dash of romance along with eye candy for both sexes into a film that never takes itself seriously yet doesn't poke fun at or offend those who grew up loving the toys. Smartly cast with awe-inspiring special effects, Bay and company have created more than just a movie. Catch it in a theater because on DVD it just won't be the same. Watching Transformers on the big screen is a real cinematic experience. The preview crowd I was with cheered the robot heroes and really interacted with the film (not to the degree it was annoying), totally caught up in what was unfolding on the screen. And strangely enough, the idea of robots battling each other with the future of mankind hanging in the balance almost seems plausible because of how ingeniously the make believe world of Autobots and Decepticons has been brought to life in Transformers.

"When I started rewatching this I fully expected to resent it as an adult so I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying practically every aspect of this movie. The characters are all either written well or performed likably enough, soundtrack is pretty stellar, CG holds up, practical elements are used which is always a welcome addition, story is simple yet effective at getting from point A to B, cinematography although by the numbers for the most part, has its moments. I don't really have anything negative to say. Even the humour is decent. Practically everything you want from a popcorn flick. A decent 8/10 from me","Aug 18, 2020",8,/10

"I am still under the shock of TRANSFORMERS even one night passed. It's soooooooooo cool! All the robots and SAM! But just like Optimus Prime said ""no sacrifice, no victory"", Michael Bay sacrificed the climax for the compact plot and the cool visual effects，which is the biggest flaw of the film script. Also I dislike the way Megatron was portrayed. In my impression, he should be a sly and powerful ""BAD"" fighter, while in this movie, he was frozen for almost all the time except the final all decisive battle with Optimus Prime. Even then, he was defeated in a very very weird way. How will they make the sequel? Anyway, I like TRANSFORMERS as it reminded me of my childhood and all the heroes in my dreams.","Jul 4, 2007",8,/10
The good thing about this movie is that it introduced Megan Fox to a wide audience. Shia is quite likable too. But the story isn't well written. There isn't much charm or humor. Michael Bay made the machines look too much alike. Seeing them tumble round and round is headache inducing. Can't tell which one is which. Shouldn't have been nominated for Oscars for visual effects - it was so awkward and confusing.The fault with many Michael Bay movies is that they have annoying stories (Pearl Harbor) and bad dialog. He needs better screen writing for all the effort and dollars dumped into this mess.,"Apr 10, 2011",2,/10
"To date there has been two movies to bring the awe and mysticism of the original format they appeared in. Spider Man and Transformers.Spider Man showed up and ""Wowed"" audiences. For the first time a comic adaptation finally brought the good points and solid bits to the big screen. Spider Man has won record acclaim and stands as a true testament that if the crew has the right mind set and the passion, it can make it happen in a way that brings not only the loved and cherished pieces but also open the door for people with zero exposure to the content.Transformers has done the same thing. It has given the fans a focal point and new outlook on their old favorites while at the same time presenting those loved characters and concepts to a wider and definitely receptive fan base. Transformers delivers everything a movie block buster should.Not neither of these are art films, but they'll be long remember as other more limited reaching titles fade away.","Jan 2, 2008",10,/10

"I am a big fan of summer blockbuster movies, and I always am eager whenever May comes around. After seeing Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, I knew the next film I really wanted to see was the Transformers, and from the trailers I was locked in like a Millennium Falcon in a Death Star tractor beam.....Boy oh boy did I get satisfied. This film was what summer blockbusters are supposed to be. Full of action, some comedy, a little drama, and eye-popping CGI. From beginning to end was a thrilling roller coaster ride of adventure. Any movie that moves you has done its job. Jaws moved everyone off the beaches, Psycho moved everyone out of the shower, and personally, as far as the Transformers are concerned? I have had to do double takes on every tractor trailer, camaro, and mustang since....","Sep 7, 2007",10,/10
"This movie is obviously geared towards the ""old school"" transformer lovers. It is also a surprisingly mature movie.Like many people I expected it to be a kid's movie, with lots of animated series alike flat humour and little story to it apart from the ""fight against the Decepticons"". Nothing was less true: the movie is surprisingly mature, has lots of humour in it that a kid would never understand. Lots of jabs towards current politics in the USA as well, some surprisingly daring in how blatant they are.The characters: another surprise. Having seen many transformers episodes myself in the past, I didn't expect much depth to the robots' characters, but they are clearly individuals, and a good effort was made to make them more alive than just ""a sentient robot"". They are unique in their own way, and each individual was put down solidly in this movie.The action: as expected, a lot of action. A lot of destruction, too.The plot: More than a few plot holes or bad logic there, some so obvious that I was surprised it passed in the script and got executed in the movie. It's probably the only big downside to this movie.In general: A nice movie if you don't mind the story of the transformers being taken in its own direction, and can forgive the holes in logic and story, and certainly if you like the old school transformers.Recommended to see at least once and decide for yourself.","Dec 30, 2007",8,/10

"Those who feel as if this movie was an 8 or better must not have seen the summer blockbusters of old. First of all, this movie has been made at least 5 or 6 times within the last decade: Jurrasic Park I, II, II, Independence Day, Godzilla, King Kong, War of the Worlds ... all different from Transformers of course, but largely rely on the same emotional impact (many lives/Earth itself in danger) and slick CGI created to lure large audiences in July.To be sure I only saw a few Transformer episodes as a kid, I wasn't really a super freak over them or anything b/c to me it was just another cartoon. So I didn't get giddy when they mentioned the name ""Megatron"" in the movie, which several people in the theater did.The performances in this movie were all horrible, all of them. The amount of overacting, especially from the cameos is extremely laughable. Any scenario involving government intelligence or military action was laden with made up words like Defcon Delta, Sector 7 or the President asking for some Ding Dongs in his red stockings. Meanwhile the same group of soldiers fight on two fronts (who knew the army was so small?). And the smartest people in the entire movie include a ridiculously beautiful blonde haired ""systems analyst"" who belongs on a runway somewhere not on a computer cracking alien codes. And when she gets stumped sneaks on over to a kid's house who lives with his grandma and plays dance dance revolution, because according to our supermodel Einstein, ""he is the only person in the world who can decipher this language"".The CGI is the only reason to watch this movie. You either have to like Transformers to enjoy this movie or enjoy the same tastes as the 16 and under crowd, otherwise your going to find it incredibly cheesy. Especially when a 40 ton robot says ""What's up baby?"" and dances, or when another pees on a human being. How about when asked how they can talk, Optimus Prime replies, ""We learned on the World Wide Web""? Cheese cheese cheese. And it's everywhere! All the time! I've only given a few examples in this review, I couldn't possibly remember them all. However, I do know that I've never cringed so much while watching a movie.I really wish I could flag all the people who gave this movie a good score, so I never have to see their warped delusions on what is and isn't a good movie ever again.","Jul 29, 2007",2,/10

"I enjoyed this movie, but had two issues. The first is more of a warning or concern. The second is more of a personal film preference.First of all, there seems to be a trend in films over the past few years to give the PG-13 rating to any big budget film that has a 99% chance of being on the ""Must Watch"" list of any group of 10-year olds, regardless if it needs it or not. With marketing targeted at pre-pubescent viewers, it can be hard to justify NOT taking your little ones to a highly anticipated film if exposure to it is everywhere. This film, however, can make the exception. For the first time in a long while, the MPAA has gotten it right. This film earns its rating as a lot of the action violence and dialogue are not appropriate for younger audiences. There is a fair amount of swearing, and brief discussion of a sexual nature. I would suggest a young couple review this film prior to taking anyone under the age of 12. Parents are the best judges as to whether or not their children are mature enough for this film.The only other issue I had with this film is the way it was shot. I cannot stand action scenes that are ""intensified"" by a shaking camera. Do directors actually believe an unsteady camera makes the action scenes better? In my opinion, scenes ""enhanced"" this way become too much of a blur to follow what's going on anyway. So why continue doing it? This kind of filming is irritating and headache-inducing. HINT: USE STEADY-SHOT!! Overall, I had a good time with this film. As a fan of the original comics, toys, TV show, and movie from the 1980's, it was fun to get back into that world. This film would have been better if the camera work hadn't given me a migraine.","Jul 2, 2007",8,/10

All the big product ads , massive marketing hype and lots of CGI and other special effects. Add some stupid cr..py dialogue , US Armed Forces propaganda and a few hot chicks for eye candy : Here is Transformers. A huge excuse for massive explosions , typical Michael Bay (creator of Pearl Harbor disaster. Not the historical attack. Disaster of a movie made in 2000 I am talking about ) style. I bet he is laughing while counting big bucks he got by suckering all stupid 15 year old male target audience (MTV generation we might say) to theaters and showed them worst acted , edited and plotted film I have ever seen in my life. I really congratulate myself in fact because I had sense not to see it in movie theater and spend money on it. I just borrowed a DVD and wasted two hours no..no endured two hours of torture. I mean CGI and massive explosions are all nice but what about character development , proper acting , a sensible story ? You know essentials of a scenario or proper editing ? Nada , zero , none. Michael Bay must have assumed that we will be in love with giant robots fighting each other and USAAF aircraft firing missiles. But robots were not even primary characters. Primary characters are a boy who wishes to impress a hot chick , his first date , a bunch of US Army grunts , a hot chick computer hacker and her fat stupid hacker friend , Defence Secretary of US ( who is old veteran actor Jon Voight. He must really have been desperate for money to play this non character ). There are so many coincidences , convenient occurrences , clichéd plot points you really have to turn your brain off to see it to the end. Lame slapstick humor completes this whole mess and destroys whatever self respect these characters or movie itself had...Hot damn I am annoyed. I will do my best to forget this latest Bay calamity.

The lead women are so good looking and done up - it's just funny, the dialog practically makes fun of themselves and the plot, well... See it for the special effects, but don't expect much else.

"Michael Bay once again delivers with the best Hollywood blockbuster of the summer which is saying a lot considering the large amount of great summer blockbusters this year. Spiderman 3 was disappointing but entertaining, Shrek The Third was funny but again disappointing, Pirates 3 was better than the second but not as good as the first and Fantastic Four 2 was entertaining but gave too much away in previews. Michael Bay's Transformers was pretty much my last hope in this years blockbusters and you can damn well bet that Transformers was the most satisfying, entertaining, and enthralling movie of the summer. I was never really one who followed the Transformers cartoons when i was young with the exception of Beast Wars but like most people not living under a rock i knew of their existence. After seeing Michael Bay's action packed and promising trailer i decided to familiarize myself with this franchise and honestly i did not like what i saw. I watched the original animated film and a spin off series called Transformers:Cybertron and while the film i felt was dated and cheesy the spin off which is a show of the 2000's was more cheesy with worse dialogue but they gave me the back story behind the Transformers and i was ready to roll. First of all Transformers is one of those movies you absolutely must see in theatres, IMAX if you can because the carnage, destruction, and mayhem is hardcore and gets you're adrenaline at an all time high. The script is surprisingly solid i figured Transformers would be 2 and a half hours of stuff blowing up but there is definitely intelligent writing behind it as well. The comedy is written perfectly i don't think i rolled my eyes once at any of the jokes because none of them sucked, and while it is sitcom like writing (meaning the actors timing makes or breaks the joke) it's not bad sitcom writing like in Ghost Rider it's hilarious and really does a great job at lightening the mood. The special effects are the best i've seen honestly better than Star Wars or Peter Jackson's King Kong absolutely flawless, nothing looks too CGI, nothing looks puppet like everything looks pretty damn real for a movie about transforming robots. The action is also extremely solid Shia LaBoef is great and definitely an up and comer however Megan Fox gives a passable performance she seemed to have some bad line delivery but still accomplished the job, Shia clearly overshadows her performance by a mile though. If you are a fan despite the little changes (Bumblebee is now a Camaro) it won't matter trust me they do such a great job at bringing a very difficult thing to the big screen with slight changes that don't detract from the overall picture. For non fans everything is explained very well you are not in need of searching for a back story before seeing the film, non fans will definitely enjoy the ride of full out non stop action. The movie overall met and slightly exceeded my expectations unlike every other film this summer so if you are expecting this movie to be amazing do not fear disappointment because it is more than meets the eye.","Jul 4, 2007",9,/10

I wasn't a huge fan of it, but I remember the cartoon being a cool franchise which still is today.I first heard of this movie as far back as 2005. And found it to be cool for a new live action movie being made for the first time ever for the Transformers series. Even though I was entirely familiar with the series background, I read some history and story lines on the internet before seeing the big picture.Eons ago on the planet Cybertron, lived a population of different life forms. Machines that have advanced into intelligent beings and formed a community on the hi-tech planet. Two sides were made: Autobots & Decepticons. The Autobots want peace and prosperity. While the Decepticons want communism and terror. Despite both sides thinking differently, they start their own war. One day a cube which is said to be the source of all their power went crashing on Earth. And it won't be found until a certain ""Day of Awakening"" occurs when either sides try to get their hands on the cube first.And it was cool, every thing to make this movie a reality was more than amazing. With today's special effects, creating the robots in a live action film is accomplish-able and would of been impossible to do a decade ago. Every big franchise gets a movie like this one. And it was about time Transformers gets revised with a blockbuster hit.There wasn't anything disappointing or boring about the movie in my opinion. Just a lot of the screen time is spent by the secondary characters than the robots themselves. A few changes made for the movie for obvious reasons. Including making both the Autobots and Decepticons look more machine like than their cartoon appearances. And there's so much detail when you look at them in the movie. I'm not an expert in cars, but I do find the transforming sequences to be believable.Overrall this movie should please both the old time and new comer fans of the series. And it's going to get it's own sequel which is being predicted to be bigger than this one itself.","Nov 14, 2007",8,/10

"At first, I was sketchy about Trannies. The trailers looked dumb, and the premise was stupid (a movie about Japanese toys/cartoons? No thank you!) Then the second trailer came out, and it seemed to promise one thing - lot's of giant robot fighting action. And it definitely delivered.The movie really surprised me in that it was hilarious. Shia LaBeouf is very funny (much like he was in Disturbia), and many of the other characters were as well. And it wasn't just a little humor to break the tension. It was flat out comedy through the whole first half of the movie. The effects were amazing. I couldn't believe that a computer made all of these giant robots. And then the way they transformed was amazing. It was so realistic (if cars really could transform into giant robots).And then there was the action. My god, was there action. Nearly and hour of robots fighting. It was so exciting and intense. I couldn't believe how much action there was.All in all, Trannies is the perfect movie. It's got action, excitement, comedy, and Megan Fox. What else could one ask for in a film?","Sep 3, 2007",9,/10

"To be frank, I wasn't that keen on seeing this when it first aired on TV. My general expectations were that it was going to be another noisy robot action film. And how wrong was I? It was much more than that. In fact it was one of the best actions films I've ever seen.I was never a Transformers fan because I got the idea from the TV series that it's just lame and cheesy. However from the movie's perspective, it brang the world of Transformers to a whole new level. Particularly why I loved it was because of the action. This obviously came from the destructive robots. They were simply amazing. My favourite was Bumble-Bee. Also, how they moved and transformed from cars to robots was well done. And not to mention the visuals/special effects. They were just out of this world.The casting was superb. Shia and Megan were the perfect choice to play the roles of Sam and Mikaela. My only negative is their acting. They did some good performances but all of that needed a little more energy.Overall, as I've already typed, this was one of the best action films I've ever seen. Great effects, great entertainment and great action.","Oct 24, 2009",8,/10

"Michael Bay has returned with his latest movie, Transformers. It has EVERYTHING you can expect from a Michael Bay film, like guns and explosions, but it's done right. The special effects are fantastic, especially for all of the robots in the film. Overall, Transformers is definitely a must-watch for anyone who loves giant transforming robots duking it out and explosions.","Jun 26, 2022",10,/10

"Great visual effect, Great comedy, and lots of action, what more do you need? Transformers is one of the few movies that managed not to take itself very seriously, even though it could and the storyline seem to ask for it. It is full of comedic moments and I find myself laughing almost throughout the movie.The only bad thing might be it drags a little towards the end. I mean, come on, we already know who's going to win and who's going to lose; there's no point on dragging the battle. The battle look amazing though. The visual effect was simply amazing. I applaud the crew who made it very believable. There are a lot of flaws but if you're not looking for it specifically, you will enjoy this movie. I know I did.I will give it 8.8 out of 10.","Jul 3, 2007",9,/10
"If you're going to see Transformers as some kind of testament to film and cinematography, don't bother. If you are the kind of person that can enjoy a movie for the action sequences alone, then you may be entertained. But if you are a stickler for good direction in those action scenes, well... it's anyone's guess then.Plot holes, TERRIBLE dialog, superfluous characters and Jon Voight were just some of the shallow points of the movie. Now, I'm not a movie goer that needs everything to be cinematically excellent; but, there is a line to my tolerance for this kind of silliness.The whole time I was battling the sleep that threatened to steal my attention away from the screen, I was thinking to myself that ""this is the worst movie I've ever seen!"" While it may not have proved to be actually worse than Robocop 3 (still the reigning champ), it was pretty darn close...I went along because my friend is nuts for the Trannies, but I regret it greatly...","Aug 4, 2007",2,/10
"Transformers had everything you could ask for in a summer blockbuster. It had high octane action scenes, very cool special effects. Great acting from shia. A very hot looking Megan Fox, and a nice bit of humor mixed in. This movie is not anywhere CLOSE to being as bad as a lot of people saying it is. I think the problem was the movie had too much anticipation and hype. People came in with very high expectations and were disappointed that it wasn't how they thought it should be. When it comes to summer movies, you can't leave your self with so much anticipation. You should go in with zero expectations and truly judge the movie on what you thought, not what someone else said. Overall, I give Transformers an 8 out of 10, because its a perfect 4th of July summer blockbuster, and I'll definitely be looking out for the second!","Jun 19, 2009",8,/10
"Now, I know better than to judge a film by the teasing trailers that are set upon us months before, but this time I have. It will never happen again. Its been 24 hours since I saw it, and I am still astonished and slightly annoyed at just how completely different the eventual film turned out to be. I was expecting a dark/serious movie aimed at adults with real substance. I shouldn't have expected so much, as, after all this is a Michael Bay movie. Explosions, action, dumb comedy, silly camera angles, hard to follow action scenes centred around an over charismatic lead 'kid' who saves the day by somehow avoiding gun fire and crumbling buildings. But don't forget, he also picks up a bird along the way, who by the way is incredibly hot. It is so ridiculous and clichéd its almost a parody of an action movie. Its either that or Michael Bay is actually taking the p**s out of himself and his previous movie attempts. I sat there in dis-belief for the most part relentlessly asking myself why? Why on gods earth did the owners of the transformers franchise give the reigns to that unimaginative fool. Now, don't get me entirely wrong, it is entertaining and the kids will love it, but thats the problem, its just completely and utterly devoid of any sort visual emotion or substance that it simply doesn't qualify as a proper film. Its just, well, a waste. But, in its defence, the special effects are truly unbelievable and the whole film is great to look at aesthetically. Oh yeah and the Chevy Camero has to get a mention.","Jul 22, 2007",3,/10
Yes i am considering Michael Bay to be one of the best directors in our time. this film truly is a great and very entertaining film. The special effects are mind Blowing and most of all The soundtrack fits perfectly with this Sci Fi flick. Shia leabouf's acting is very good. But the most outstanding thing which I saw in this movie were the fight scenes between the auto-bots and the Decepticons. But they should have extended the fight scene between bumbelbee and the decepticon.The action just hits in your face. I cant wait till Transformers 2 comes. And According to certain sources Transformers 2 is going to be more explosive than Transformers. The rating which I give for this film a Solid 9.,"Jan 8, 2008",9,/10

"Transformers: A mind blowing massive blockbuster that will always be remembered. The storyline was interesting and kept you wanting to know more and more, the action scenes were cool (except maybe the last action scene were to much things are going on at once it's kind of hard to tell what's going on) besides that they were generally good. the actors did a great job at it (remeber the auto-bots weren't really there) so its not an easy role to play but they kept it good, especially Shia.But above all Michael Bay was the mastermind behind all this, he made the scenes really work, off coarse the special effects were brilliant too, also all that hyped talk about Bay ruining the film, but he proved the world wrong, He is a great director one of the best out there for sure.Michael bay did nothing at all too ruin the film, so don't listen to haters. His camera shot's were perfect, his ability that made some important dialogue stand out was brilliant. The amazing crew did a wonderful job. From directing to the creators. The special effects and visuals were mind blowing. You can't get better effects in a movie. Congratulation to them all.All in all a great entertaining blockbuster, with mind blowing effects, humour and great action packed scenes. go and see it!","Apr 30, 2009",10,/10
"I liked Transformers and that's why this movie disappointed even more.It's just ridiculous. There are only two good things about this movie. Shia LaBeouf's performance because he's an amazing young actor (as you can see in Disturbia much better than in this movie) and the special effects. Oh, don't get me wrong the fighting scenes are well made. The transformers look great. But it's so predictable! Even the fighting scenes are predictable. I knew exactly when Optimus Prime was going to appear, when he or Bumblebee were going to save Sam and when Megatron would attack; because it was too obvious! The romance was ridiculous, after all she was his classmate and never noticed him, but hey, since she needed a ride, why not hook up with the guy with the car? Please... I found it offensive, because it represented male chauvinism.I'm sorry to those who don't agree with me, but I can't say it's worth seeing, except for its especial effects and LaBeouf's performance, the rest of the movie is just bad. If you want to see a good mecha action movie this is not it.","Jul 23, 2008",2,/10
"The '07 movie is the best live action Transformers movie, the effects are mind-numbingly jaw dropping and along with the effects in ROTF and DOTM are the best I've ever seen in film history. The action is like really really really good, the opening scene with Blackout in Qatar is a bone chilling introduction to the live action TF universe, and introduces us to one of the most badass and intimidating robots in the franchise. The characters are somewhat whatever, but I feel Shia did a really good job as Sam in this movie, I somehow miss Sam in many regards and prefer him way more over Cade. I also really liked Turturro as Simmons over the course of the franchise. Sure the characters are kinda mid, but I really enjoy this movie. The score by Steve Jablonsky is also iconic and is very memorable, it's one of my favourite scores of all time and across the first three films it definitely adds a lot (you kind of just forget about it in AOE and TLK as you're subject to a lethal dosage of awful moviemaking). I keep coming back to this movie to relive childhood memories. Compared to the s**tshows that are ROTF, AOE, and TLK, this movie is very very solid, one of my favourites for sure.","Feb 9, 2020",10,/10

"I was a bit disappointed at the way the movie turned out. Being a Transformers kid, and having collected comics and watched the 1st generation Transformers TV cartoons in the early 80s, I expected more sensibilities from the story and lesser plot holes at that. I gave this title a higher rating because of the fact that it's about Transformers and that Transformers, as a personal favorite, played a huge role in my childhood years.The saving grace for this movie was its special effects, and then the fantastic CGI rendering and animation. I would have desired the look of the robots to resemble the 1st generation robots more but the production team, unfortunately, may have opted to focus on realistic physical aesthetics. Also, I found out that they mostly drowned the transformation sound - which they claimed to have reproduced for this movie. This distinct sound is a very important key element for the movie's overall success as it would have provided nostalgic inspiration to the Transformers fans of my generation.Maybe I was expecting too much from the story but that's just me. In fact, I actually have high expectations for movies coming out from Marvel's comics line. Seeing Michael Bay direct this movie got many people excited about the kind, ferocity and quality of the action scenes and special effects they were going to expect. I give this aspect a near-perfect score but the story and the script should have been improved more, I think.I still enjoyed the movie nonetheless for all its action-packed merits. And simply because Transformers is just a hands-down favorite.","Jul 5, 2007",8,/10
"Awesome, awesome, awesome. Must watch for all Michael Bay fans. I saw this on DVD and it is already a part of my collection.The movie starts a glimpse of what a transformer could like be and how dangerous they can be. Then come our friendly transformers, bumblebee, optimus prime and others. And then comes Megatron, the most evil one. And then, the evil vs good fight. the good wins, the bad dies. There are sacrifices, but hey, there are always sacrifices.The movie is full of edge-of-the-seat action. Amazing spl effects, especially the transformation of aliens. You'll find everyone is a hero in this movie. Definitely, there would be Transformers 2 and I am waiting for it.","Oct 21, 2007",9,/10

"I mean like whoa. That's as far as they thought it through. That's it. Big robots, they talk, and transform into human vehicles. This is the movie. It's not a spoiler. Just the truth. If you're into big robots and big booms go see it. If you're a movie maniac you will not buy the DVD. If you saw even one episode of transformers ever in your life, you'll be disappointed. Bigtime.What they didn't think was to give them personality. Instead they shoot one corny line after another and no dialog exists. Bumblebee could have been funny and interesting. In this movie he's just a stupid, big robot who delivers another predictable and sooo corny line at the end. All robots, Autobots and Decepticons could have had tons of personality injected in them. They had none. Their role in the movie is to create big fireworks. That's it. Optimus Prime should have been the most interesting of all, up to a majestic level, not a corny, suicidal, half-witted brute you idiots.Anyway. The actors.... sucked. I'm not sure if it's them or the script. I'm pretty sure i hate the script so it might not be their fault. But! Shia LaBeouf should not have a lead in this movie. Or any movie. Megan Fox is the stereotype pretty but hard life girl that falls for the dorky idiot. All characters are only stereotypes and none of the actors can deliver a good performance.The scenes are overly crowded, awfully put cut and put together. They could have been great, but it's a sudden mix of.. of... everything ! If you look at any 5 minutes of the movie you see 80% of playing characters. And they end in the worst places. I had like 20 scenes that ended before i felt i would have wanted them to end. Something nice, or cool, or adding to the plot should have been right around the corner. But no. We go to the next scene.And the soundtrack... You know the music that comes up when heroes arrive at the scene, and they move slowly, saving the day. That's the only kind of music. And there's nothing appropriate on screen. Almost never. they hit some spots just because that music is like forever on.See this movie with no expectations, a big bag of popcorn and don't get expect to be sucked in. Just enjoy the special effects. Those are the only things in this movie worth seeing.","Jul 14, 2007",3,/10
"I absolutely loved this movie, with one exception.....the chase scene between bumble bee and barricade!!!! this had the potential to be one of the best car chase scenes in film history, but it seems as if the crew didn't pick up on this!!! this scene should have been 4 or 5 minutes of these two bad-asses chasing each other all over the place, but alas, it wasn't. Although i will say the part with Barricade jumping in the air and transforming into the saleen was my favorite part of the movie!!! a little disappointing but hopefully next time around we will get to see bumble bee truly flex his muscles as that unbelievable Caro!!!!! Bravo Michael bay though for delivering yet another phenomenal action movie!!! Bring on the sequel.........and hopefully the chase sequence I, and I'm sure a lot of fans are looking for!!!!!","Oct 18, 2007",10,/10
"This following review has no product placement whatsoeverthe movie being reviewed has done enough of that on its own. Transformers is a great idea turned sour because of pitiful writing, bad directing, sloppy acting, weak editing, and a slew of perky little flaws that some people will catch but others will totally miss. With such a heavy budget, one would think that they could hire better writers, right? And Mr. Bay, why on earth do you still attempt to add emotion to your mind-numbingly loud movies? The special effects were indeed amazing and the CGI work was nearly flawless, but that gets tampered by all the lower-budget work involved. This movie could have been cut by nearly 40 minutes, the pacing was slow, it was just all wrong. To fail this movie would be exaggerating considering the intensive effort into making the robots (and the effects were executed perfectly) but do not expect anything worthy of being among the summer popcorn champs past and present.In a mindless action movie, a plot isn't totally necessary but something has to be established in order to give the viewer a reason to continue watching despite all the explosions and body parts flying. Transformers doesn't have a weak plot (Powerful cube-like object embedded in the Earth and two armies of alien robotic things fighting to obtain it) but the dialogue is easily the weakest portion of the film. It must have been so hard for the actors and actresses to not laugh at some of the insanely cheese things they have to say. Bay hasn't been very lucky with the whole dialogue thing (Pearl Harbor, The Island) but its reached a new low here. What also mars this movie is the endless amount of clichés sprinkled all over the place. The pretty-female-with-jerk cliché has been done way, way, way too many timesplease stop now. Oh, and let's not forget the barrage of plot holes too (How can ANYONE outrun a Transformer?!)Acting was rather wooden as well. Despite decent performances from Jon Voight, Rachael Taylor, and John Turturro (hey, its not his fault he had so many bad lines) the acting was pretty weak. The voice acting amongst the Transformers was a mixed bag, and Shia LaBaouf comes off as pretty annoying sometimes. The lead female, Megan Fox, is amazingly pretty but that was about it. Speaking of wooden, let's discuss the musical score, which seems to borrow from all other popcorn flicks, including previous Bay works.The worst part of Transformers is Michael Bay himself. Despite the screenplay, he could still craft a clever action movie; it has been done before (The Rock, Bad Boys anyone?). Instead, we get the hypersensitive camera work, the spinning-cam that Bay has suddenly fallen in love with, too many long shots of people looking at something, and then too many close-ups during the fights, resulting in a mess of a battle. Sometimes, its extremely difficult to see who is fighting what and who is the hero and who is the villain. Like Fantastic Four: Silver Surfer, there were little action quips, but no major action sequences until the very end; which even then consists of a lot of miniature battles jumbled up into one final showdown.In order to get to the action we've all been craving, we have to put up with pointless and useless character development and unnecessary scenes that made the movie at least 40 minutes longer. Michael Bay is no Spielberg; he cannot portray emotion for the life in him. His pacing is really fast when conflict is spewing, but when this isn't happening the gears shift into negative third gear. Spielberg should have been working on this, since summer popcorn blockbusters is his specialty (Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones trilogy, Minority Report, Jaws, War of the Worlds). Bay should have just made this a frenzied action film, instead of a complete film full of all sorts of genres, from comedy to action to romance.Something not to gripe about however are the incredible special effects. The robots look absolutely fantastic, and their movements flow beautifully. Despite the camera moving too much and not finding the right range, the robots going at it is one of the best-looking CGI shots in the history of cinema, and we've been very blessed with incredible special effects this summer with At World's End. The audience was applauding every single time that a robot was first revealedunfortunately they don't get much screen time. As a matter of fact, some just ultimately disappear from the film altogether, while some have extended periods of absence. Nonetheless, when you do see them, your jaw will drop in amazement.Bottom Line: Wonderful special effects destroyed by practically all other aspects of the film. Whether it's the bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad pacing, or just overall all-around bad clichéd cheese, Transformers is a very good idea turned sour because it fell into the wrong hands. Bay should stay away from all attempts of adding emotion to film and just blow things up and create carnage. However, he even screwed that up by giving the camera a bad case of Parkinson's. Transformers may entertain the hardcore fans but it will take a while to see the action that's been advertised heavily in the media everywhere. Watch it once, see it for the booms and kapows and blams, and then forget about it like most of Bay's other works. Wait, what else has Bay directed?","Jul 7, 2007",4,/10
"Absolutely great movie. Entertaining, great cast great supporting cast great supporting roles. Great story, fantastic plot. It had fantastic action shots as well as fantastic robot transformations.

"I never saw any of the cartoons as a kid or knew anything about transformers until I saw this movie. Ive seen this movie so many times. It took me year to finally appreciate this movie for what it is but I've finally written a review for it, and this is what I think. There are no words that can be written to explain how this movie is one of the best movies of all time. You could possibly say it's one of the best action/adventure movies of all time. It's 100% the best Transformers movies of the series. The CGI, the story, the action and the entire plot still keep up to this day. The fact that this is the first of the Transformers movies does make it the best of the Transformers series. Simply because of the fact that it adds that shock and awe of the entire world in which the movie is set. Every time you see a transformer in the movie it feels like you are seeing a transformer for the first time. Which this being the first movie in the series, you are seeing it for the first time. But the characters, interactions and reactions to the Transformers make it feel so genuine and enthusiastic, and realistic that you feel with them when you see these giant robots. Also shia labeoufa acting as the main character just blows through the roof as a stand out feature in the movie. I will recommend this movie till the day I die as an action adventure movie requirement to see. One of my favorite movies. And top 10 action movies of all time. This movie is ""MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE""","Mar 11, 2025",10,/10
"First and foremost, I should mention that I am not familiar with the cartoon. Therefore, my review will not compare this film to the cartoon in any way, shape or form. In fact, all movie long I was expecting the autobots to form together and become Voltron - different cartoon altogether as it turns out. What I'm trying to say is, if you're some sort of purist, this review is unlikely to help you. Then again, if you're a Transformers cartoon maniac, you're probably going to watch the movie no matter what I write here.With that said, let's get on to the review. I liked it. I thought the movie was pretty entertaining, fun, and worth my time to watch it. Shia La-la-la--la boof! buff? Either way, gesundheit!. Yeah, he was good. He really made the movie for me, his unusual name aside. This guy is funny and offsets the action and suspense quite nicely, providing the audience with some relief from all the edge-of-your-seat hoopla.Like I said, overall the film was pretty good. I can't give it more than a 5/10 though because aside from the action and the drop of humor mixed in, this film really wasn't about anything. Alien robots duke it out on Earth's soil, horny teenager gets involved, girl has history of family issues - hardly vital to the story, and all this drama for what - a cube? This must be one hell of a cube, probably kicks the Rubik's cube to the curb, I imagine. I guess with a movie of this sort though, the story/plot/order of events is simply a vehicle for all that kick-arse action. That's fine of course, if you like that sort of thing.For me to have given this film a better rating, it would have needed a more compelling story with some sort of theme, purpose, reason for existing other than to have its audience drool over its coolness. I like my films to be a little more meaningful, I guess. You know, artsy fartsy. Sometimes just fartsy.This film was neither of course, but I still think it's worth watching. Hey, just look at its rating! Someone's likin' it.","Oct 27, 2007",5,/10
"I'm almost always disappointed by adaptations of things I loved as a child to a big-screen blockbuster (i.e. Spiderman, Batman, Superman, etc.) but Transformers does not disappoint. It's a big, loud, and slightly silly action movie, but it does everything right. Fantastic effects, big explosions, tense action and excellent character development for the Autobots. The budget for this movie must have been absolutely through the roof.LaBouef did a great job as the incredulous teenager.Now I just need to keep my fingers crossed for a decent follow up in the form of Transformers 2.A solid 8 out of 10.","Jul 4, 2007",8,/10
"Seriously, I wasn't expecting much of Transformers. When I saw the teaser trailer for this I thought it was going to be a ""War of the Worlds"" like movie. After seeing the theatrical trailer I thought that it wouldn't be that serious but was still gonna be a cool action movie. First, Michael Bay. I couldn't understand why people hated that guy that much, now I do. His direction was the worst thing of the movie. The action sequence were... well, lets just say everything exploded and bullets and cars were flying everywhere. And I couldn't understand what the hell was going on. When Optimus Prime started talking I lost my hopes for this movie. Yes, the special effects, and the sound were excellent. But Michael Bay screw that up by showing stuff that were practically like ""Very nice, but I think I have already seen this, can we continue?"" The story was stupid, it had no sense at all. Now, enough for the bad stuff. About the rest of the movie. It was very, very funny to watch. Until the autobots and the decepticons were introduced. I like the middle of the movie, but I dislike the beginning a bit and specially the end. The acting was OK, but wasn't superb. Shi LaBeouf and John Voight were pretty good. And I laughed a lot with them. As I said before the special effects are amazing but the action sequences were not captured very well and there were many dull times.Overall I thought it was OK, but it wasn't that good as everyone was saying...6/10","Aug 1, 2007",5,/10
"The CGI/special effects for 2007 especially were really well done and this is one of the better Michael Bay movies. Sure his directing gets to be a little over the top in some ways and the movie distracts itself with dumb humor. However, the awesome action, production, and Transformer fun outweighs any negatives in my opinion. I really should give this one a rewatch and if I like it less after that then so be it. When this came out when I was only in 4th/5th grade it was quite a spectacle and launched quite a big franchise filled with other impressive special effect accomplishments. Michael Bay deserves credit and had guts for taking on this project and for better or worse, I can't complain about what he did too much (until later installments since the negatives started to outweigh the good).","Dec 31, 2023",8,/10

"Michael Bay has directed seven theatrical films now. For a long time he was a trash director. Before ""The Island,"" he had five to his name: ""Bad Boys (1995),"" ""The Rock (1996),"" ""Armageddon (1998),"" ""Pearl Harbor (2001)"" and ""Bad Boys II (2003)."" Only ""The Rock"" is not deplorably bad, and the other four sometimes border on unwatchable. I refused to see ""The Rock"" for a long time, but did on the advice of a friend, and after seeing it, I felt that Bay could be a legend one day if all of his films were that good.Bay has now increased his record to three for seven. ""The Transformers"" is a first rate Science Fiction film that abundantly brings action, drama, computer visuals and inventive sound to the screen. While I contend that ""The Matrix"" did not deserve its visual effects Oscar, I give no argument to its sound effects award. ""The Transformers"" employs equal inventiveness and raises sound effects to a level never achieved before.The most challenging effects are the complex transformations themselves. They take place so quickly that it is impossible to see most detail, but the ear has no such limitation and the terrific sound sells the illusion. I look forward to the DVD release so I can discover how many creative noises were used in the symphonic cacophony of sound (how's that for an oxymoron?).The brilliant audio is not limited to the transformations. A transformer named Frenzy attacks with hurled blades with a distinctive hum that will be tattooed on my mind forever. The transformers' voices are all mechanized and deepened, yet easily distinguished from each other. Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from ""The Matrix"") voices Megatron and his voice is altered so well that I could not tell it was him, yet their speech is easy to understand. There are a host of other examples like the whizzing of Scorponok's blender hands, the hum of Starscream's jet engine, the sound of the robots' computer hacking, missiles zooming through the sky, shockwaves, and the crunch of metal beings striking one another.The opening narration explains the premise. ""The Cube"" can create planets and fill them with life. On the transformers' home world, a group called the Decepticons used the Cube for evil, and the entire planet was rendered lifeless in the following war. The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) scour the stars in hopes of destroying the Cube to prevent the Decepticons from ravaging other worlds.Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBouf) is the grandson of an arctic explorer. The explorer found the frozen Megatron, leader of the Decepticons. Megatron's followers come to Earth and believe that the Cube is here and Sam holds the key to finding it. An Autobot named Bumblebee locates Sam and protects him until his comrades can arrive.Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense John Keller (Jon Voight) gathers the most brilliant computer students in the country to identify who hacked into their defense system. One of them (Rachael Taylor) asserts that an artificial intelligence did, and is bluntly dismissed. Witwicky picks up Michaela, the High School belle (Megan Fox), and they are both thrust into the crisis when Bumblebee fights a Decepticon disguised as a police car. Another Decepticon destroys an airbase in the Middle East.Complicating the matter is Agent Simmons (John Turturro) of Sector 7, a secret group whose existence is unknown to even Secretary Keller. This point is where the film works against itself. Simmons knows enough to realize the scale of the threat, yet he takes the simplest course of action--arrest the Witwickys. No questions, no thinking, no planning, just barging in with handcuffs. Simmons waves his ""do anything I want and get away with it"" badge in their faces like a power hungry child. Optimus Prime frees the family, but when the largest SWAT team comes out of nowhere, the Autobots no longer help, even when the government peons capture Bumblebee.""Why should we protect them?"" protests Autobot Ironhide, ""they are a primitive, violent species."" When I heard that line, I almost agreed with him. The government had made its noose and placed it around its necks, and were about to jump. It all works out, of course, when Keller intervenes, but suppose it had not. The Decepticons might have won. I have no problems with Turturro's work, but I hate seeing him on screen since he seems to always play idiot of the decade.I wrote in my review of ""Spider-Man 3"" that the Academy could hand it the visual effects Oscar. After seeing the awesome climax, I have to reconsider that statement. The sand effects in the Spider-Man film were more impressive, but nearly the entire finale here is computer created, and it is long. It is sometimes hard to follow who is who, since only Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, Megatron and Starscream have their own personalities.Were it not for Agent Simmons, this film may have received a ten star score, although I wanted to see more of the Optimus, Megatron fight. The human characters exceeded my expectations and the setup allows a strong foundation. In any case, Michael Bay is now a respectable director, and I look forward to his next film.","Aug 23, 2007",8,/10
"As a fan of the original cartoon as a kid, I was really looking forward to a grown-up, serious motion picture treatment of the Transformers. Instead, Michael Bay's version (as is the case with so many of his movies) was an embarrassment. Aside from the battle scenes on the highway and in the city at the end - which were, admittedly, pretty amazing - I can't find too many positive points. All of the forced moments of humor (Independence Day all over again) took away from what could've been a cool storyline. The scene where the Autobots were in the back yard seemed to go on forever, and was only missing the Three Stooges. Michael Bay seems so intent on trying to please every audience, that his film-making takes very few risks. Yeah, I understand that it was based on the original line of toys and the cartoon, but the kids who enjoyed those two elements are now in their 20's and 30's. They don't need this story to be kid-sized for them anymore. This is simply a case of studio execs, producers and a director who couldn't decide if they should make a Transformers movie for today's kids (who will buy their new line of toys) or for the original fans (who deserve a story minus the kid gloves). Instead, they made a movie that lands disappointingly somewhere in the middle.","Jul 26, 2007",3,/10
"As Transformers is relatively new in the cinema, I will get straight to the point about Transformers. I will not give any spoilers, as it unfair on those who have not seen it yet.The special effects in the movie are truly amazing and on this front must be praised highly. Bringing the Robots to life from the hits 80's animation is a brilliant site to observe. Their are noticeable faults with designs of the robots and camera work, which is unwatchable at times. The movie is meant to specially appeal to the generation who were raised within the decade. This though is very questionable following a full viewing of the movie.The new ideas and concepts executed in the movie are little baffling and reference to technology related to the animated series appears to be scarce for example energon cubes, telecom1 and so on. Their is only a brief mention of cyperton, the distinct planet the robots hailed from. Instead huge emphasis is directed on the moderns gimmicks such as mobile phones, computers and internet rather than the technology that we have been accustomed in the cartoon if you get what I mean.The Transformers make only brief appearances in the movie, with the human characters surpassing the length of time against the transformers.Instead we pay our money just to see the human world, rather than the robot world which transformers is about. For example high school life, Spike's parent obsession with their lawn and excessive levels of military and FBI operations. All these scenes are totally unnnecessary and would of condensed the movie to 90mins, rather than an epic 2 and half hours of useless material.The characterisation of the movie is totally bland. None of human characters had much emotion and humour at all. The robots hardly exhibited much personality at all, with the Deceptiocons being portrayed as violence and destructive. For example Megratron hardly had any personality and the ruthless streak he exhibits in the cartoons. The relentless rivalry between Megratron and Starscream is non-existence. Optimus Prime to me, is by far the strongest character in the movie, with a component of heroism's. The dialogue is very weak in the movie.Overall, the movie would been destined a great science fiction movie. I felt it has real potential to be a great movie. Michaeal Bay and the script writers mess it up completely with too much gimmicks , unnecessary scenes andpolitics. The overwhelming hype movie received failed to live to its expectations. I ended up a gloomy and disappointed audience following a weak showing of the movie. The summer promised some great movies, but Transformers though by a long margin fails to fit into this category. I feel betrayed of what I have seen as it does not fail I am watching a cartoon of Transformers. If a sequel is on the pipeline, than drastic improvements needs to be made and needs to tie much as possible with the original cartoon without too much emphasis on humans and more on robots and their personality.

"Thanks to the sequels falling short and the franchise going on for far too long, there are people who vocally hate Michael Bay's Transformers movies and everything about them. Some of their criticism is overblown and some of it is 100 % justified. That said, I think that people are overly harsh on the first Transformers movie and unfairly blame it for the mistakes of its sequels.Is ""seemingly ordinary high school student is a dork but then becomes an unlikely hero and saves the world a cliché""? Yes but I don't care. Shia LeBeouf does a good job playing Sam Witwicky and I can't help but laugh at the realization that he gave himself the username Ladiesman217 (and the Transformers calling him by that name because they found him via the Internet makes it even funnier.)I know they got some flack from the critics but I find Sam's exaggeratedly embarrassing parents entertaining.I know some people have complained that Mikaela is little more than eye candy for the male gaze (and I understand that criticism) but Mikaela also has her own backstory where she served time in juvenile hall for refusing to snitch on her automobile thief father, refuses to put up with her stereotypical jock boyfriend and knows everything there is to know about Automobile mechanics in addition to helping the heroes fight the villains. Sam was right in saying that ""there's more than meets the eye"" to her.And I honestly can't but love Optimus Prime as the paragon of heroism and valour that he is throughout the film. And (even if Hugo Weaving disliked the role), I love the villainous Megatron in this movie. I appreciate how he is complete, pure, unadulterated evil. He wants to conquer both worlds for nothing but power and that works quite well for me. Not every villain needs a sympathetic backstory or tragic dimension.And (to keep this review spoiler free), the only thing that I'll say about the climax is that I liked how it was resolved. Also, as is necessary in a movie like this, there are a lot of exciting action scenes.Does this movie have flaws? Yes. Are there better movies out there? Yes. Even so, it's a decent action flick (and cared about its storyline in a way that the sequels generally didn't) and if you watch it, I suspect you'll find there's more to it than meets the eye.","Feb 11, 2024",9,/10
"Really fun! This film has some eye popping visuals. Dear Michael Bay, I humbly...honestly humbly, ask you to stick to this kind of movie. No more Pearl Harbors. THIS is your forte. It's fantastic. I also liked that this film (mostly) steered clear of the action sequence-sarcastic comment/catch phrase attempt convention. Shia did an excellent job. I look forward to his future. If you are on the fence about whether or not to catch this film, I say go see it. It has some extremely creative action sequences and likable characters. There are a couple of lines of bad dialog, but nothing unforgivable. There are also some seemingly tacked-on plot points. Overall though, a good time!","Jul 4, 2007",8,/10

I really can't stand people who go see this movie expecting the perfect movie. Is the story the greatest? No. Does it live up to the original cartoon? Thats hard to do when you have an entire generation of Transformer fans out there with different tastes and views. Is it a cool action flick? Absolutely. I was disappointed with only one thing. I didn't hear the cool Transformer sound. There was sound but not that classic sound we all know. The toy line seems to lack this as well. Overall I loved sharing this movie with my son. I loved the Transformers as a kid and I love it that he is just as excited about it. His favorite is Bumblebee. Mine was too but I like the classic Bumblebee. Don't get me wrong the Camero is cool but I miss the Volkswagen Beetle. If you are looking for a fun movie with lots of explosions and cool graphics this movie is a good one to see. If you are looking for the perfect homage with the best story line and Oscar winning performances then just stay at home.,"Jul 11, 2007",9,/10
"I grew up in the late eighties/early nineties so Transformers(especially the toys) were something I'm familiar with. Fast forward to 2007 and I'll admit, seeing that the little cartoon from my early childhood was going to be made into a Michael Bay blockbuster got me a little giddy and weary at the same time. Giddy because I figured, Okay, robots on the big screen. That should be cool. The weariness came from hearing Michael Bay would take the directing chair. I went in thinking this movie would be all action(which it mostly was) but was pleasantly surprised by Labouf.His comical timing, wit and true-to-life scared shitless-at-these-alien-robots acting was superb. I enjoyed the scenes he was in the most, obviously. John Voight was not at his top game, but still pretty good. And John Tutoro is always a treat to see in a movie. The rest of the cast was good, with all the side stories coinciding. Anthony Anderson was hilarious as a hacker with good intentions. Megan Fox is smokin' hot, and she's a decent actress as well.The script to this movie was pretty well done, I must say. To take a campy cartoon and turn it into a big budget movie must have taken some balls. It was mostly unbelievable, but it's a movie, so all is forgiven. Some of the dialogue could be considered cheesy, but it was pulled off nicely by the cast. The story was a bit confusing and towards the end it got somewhat convoluted, but overall was easy to follow.Transformers is a must see this summer. And look for Labouf to be like the next Dicaprio. He went from a kid in a Project Greenlight movie to a full fledged star of this summer's biggest hit.and it will be this summer's biggest hit. The way threequels are going, it's bound to do better than the other movies that have come out.","Jul 4, 2007",5,/10
"I became a Transformers fan after watching Armada and fell in love with it. I knew it would be loosely based on Generation 1 and it would be a success. It has a cast that I recognized, top-notch action scenes and the best of all, Peter Cullen as Prime!!! I watched the entire Gen 1 (from start to finish) on DVD (and I loved it) by the time I'm typing this comment. Even though Frank Welker doesn't do Megatron in the movie, I didn't care. Hugo Weaving is pretty good as the antagonist. I love the humor in it especially when Ironhide impersonates Dirty Harry. Also love the song selection. ""What I've Done"" by Linkin Park is pretty good for a theme song even though it's released before the movie.If you love Transformers, go see it. Can't wait to see the sequel.","Feb 13, 2009",10,/10

"I literally just got done seeing this. You can call me a fan boy if you want and you're probably right. While well done, this movie was NOT as bad ass as I was told it was. Sure, there were good action scenes and some funny moments as well but it just didn't seem complete to me for some odd reason.First of all, whenever Megan Fox was on screen, I was distracted by her. Can she be any hotter? Second, Hugo Weaving is NOT Megatron. He was adequate for what he needed to do, but it's just not the same.Third, I have a lot of unanswered questions. I understand ""suspension of disbelief"" but how can a human sized robot walk right past a large crowd of people (with people FACING him) and not get caught? I'm really not trying to bash this, I just wasn't very impressed. There was, however, some good to it.The voice acting wasn't too bad, the action scenes were done very well and I'm glad there were little things that honored the cartoon series.Fans may enjoy this, fan boys may not. I'm not making a recommendation or a non-recommendation. I can only tell you to judge for yourself.","Jul 26, 2007",5,/10
"I was going to watch this movie only cause i see it had potential,after see it,it was like eating pizza:leaving satisfied. Transformers is the way how a concept must be adapted,i mean,this isn't based in the cartoons,is based in the toys of the same name,and IT ISN'T FOR KIDS,they create a good story and it looks like Revenge of the Fallen will be DA BOMB! in theaters. The special effects are from 1st class,but in the battles between Autobosts and Decepticons i can't see who is who,but is enjoyable. Shia LeBouf as Sam do a good ""meanwhile"" in the movie and his attraction to the girl makes the funny moments in this serious movie. Megan Fox...wow,she let my eyes totally open. I only wish that there was more action scenes,but thinking that is only the first movie,that point is out.The acting is good,and the black guy is funny,as the rest of the characters. The most impressive is the awesome way they create Optimus Prime and the rest of the transformers in the movie using FX from 1st class,they movie decently and they have the classic voice of a huge robot.Way to go to Michael Bay!","May 9, 2009",9,/10

"Again, Michael Bay gives us a very good entertaining film from beginning to end. Transformers is a real blockbuster. It has everything necessary in it to entertain you from beginning to end: good acting, special effects, excellent cinematography, good story, excellent music,... Michael Bay knows how to make a movie, that's for sure! Shia LeBoeuf is very well cast as the lead actor, and also Megan Fox is well chosen because she acts pretty good and she looks nice too! The transformers are really well done. That surprised me,because I thought the robots would just be stupid fighting machines, but here the Autobots have actual emotions and that I really liked. I loved the interaction between the robots and the humans. The things Optimus Prime said about the human race were nothing less than beautiful and was one of the best parts of the movie. The film was also pretty funny sometimes. Now some critics apparently hated this movie, but I don't care at all. Almost everyone whom I talked with about Transformers liked it. And that is what really counts. Transformers is an excellent combination of action, romance, humor, emotions and CGI-effects. With all these things I still add the excellent cinematography and music and simply excellent direction in general. I've seen all the films by Michael Bay now and I'm really looking forward to Transformers 2 and 2012: The War For Souls!Go and watch Transformers! It's really good!","Jan 4, 2008",8,/10
"I love Transformers! I watched this movie over and over again when I was a child because it was very awesome! The action and suspense was not only extremely epic but it was another film that revolutionized using CGI since the transformers looked very real and very cool! The story was a great story about be brave, be a man, don't be selfish, take care of your family, and really take the fight to evil in-order to save lives! There were some really funny moments. All of the actors did awesome at their roles. The music sounded great! The only correction I'd make to this film is the foul language otherwise it'd be a 10/10!

"I saw Transformers yesterday and I didn't expect much. For starters I'm not fond of Michael Bays movies. Technically this movie is very well made, the special effects, sound and the photo (typical high budget action photo) slow motion faded music closeups. The thing about this movie that bothers me the most are all the silly one-liners and comic reliefs, and apparently most of the audience that saw the movie liked it. They laughed when they were suppose to laugh. And as an old Transformers fan i really missed the old characteristics of the robots. Basically Optimus and Bumblebee were the only bots that you could recognize. This movie is more ""cool"" than good.

"Seven years since this was released and we've had a decent sequel and an even better third movie, yet looking back at the first Transformers not a lot has changed and that's for the better. Bay is sticking to his big scale action and use of jaw dropping visuals, ignoring the critics and pretty much saying kiss my ass and good for him, Bay has fun and so do I with his movies.The special effects created by Industrial Light And Magic are undeniably some of the best I've ever seen, no one can say they suck because they are genuinely groundbreaking, watching these vehicles turn into enormous talking robots sounds cheesy in words but seeing it unfold is breathtaking. When Sam Witwicky unknowingly buys a car that is actually the Transformer Bumblebee, he becomes entangled in a plot that could destroy life on Earth, but when Optimus Prime and fellow Autobots arrive on Earth looking for The Cube, they realise Sam has the key to it's location. Shia Labeouf is very funny as this rather dumb teenage character, he does tend to sulk and moan a lot but he's still likable, however during the city based finale he springs into instant action guy managing to avoid robot destruction that even for me who ignores logic I found this part unrealistic yet entertaining. Michael Bay's camera-work is a dream, technically sound and huge in scale Transformers is larger than life science fiction storytelling. The action scenes are a marvel, the scorpion desert attack is my favourite, the moment the alien leaps out the sand whilst army guys run in terror in slow motion my jaw dropped and from then on it's literally an onslaught of gunfire and the odd bit of humour thrown in. You could argue that the story could've solely been focused on the military characters, as they would be more believable in conflict instead of Sam Witwicky but Bay settled on Sam and that's where the human side of the story comes in. Thrown into this monster of a movie is the stunning Megan Fox who plays Sam's love interest Mikaela, a beauty with brains who can fix up cars, Fox' first big movie role and she's brilliant, she doesn't fall beneath the scale and brings humour and grit to her character. Transformers is a must watch movie, turn up the speakers, grab a drink and prepare to be immersed.","May 13, 2015",8,/10

You have the badly casted Shia LaBeouf and the even worse casted Megan Fox along with many other usually welcoming performers slapped into silly and unnecessarily cringe scenes in order to project the product as favourable to a certain audience that could be described as simple brainless teens who like fake adult implicative comedy.

The acting was A+. there was on scenes though in which the computer animation was vary noticeable but other wise I Think this is defiantly one for the best movies off 2007. I love how they stuck to music without lyrics it made it so much easier to concentrate on the movie instead of going OK so who sings this song. But a few time they do use snips o music but it works in the movie during those items. I love how It suck to the basic concept of th original also but they did however change a few things ons pretty big one but ow well I think it was for the3 best that they did change it.

"Sam Witwicki is the poor boy of his school, he dreams in the prettiest and he knows that he never will be able to be with her. when he buys his first car (an ancient Camaro) his life changes. The Camaro results to be a Transformer. An ancient civilization devastated by war between the Autobots (that defend the liberty) and the Decepticons (that defend that the stronger must command). They search a legendary artifact: the Cube, that will unbalance the war to one side. Well first of all it is compulsory to congratulate the fantastic special effects that are on the movie. They not seem CG at any moment and sometimes it is like the robots are also actors. The landing of Starscream or the skating of Barricade are good examples. All the action scenes and all the moments when the robots fight are just impressive. It is clear that Michael Bay knows how to do this things. The main problem is the fact that the movie has nothing more than that, the story is childish and it has some little holes with the size of an Death Star. Many things happen without any reason, the good ones solve many problems just because they are the good ones, there are lots of stupid jokes in order to make people laugh (only the robots hiding in the garden is good). Thinking about the fan side, the fact that Bumblebee is know a Camaro, well is kind of heretic, but once you accept this, it is good, the movie is like the comic totally, it is as it should be if the comic was a movie. Probably with a more worked plot the movie would have been a good one, but, well it's a blockbuster, then, there's no will of making it good, just spectacular (And it really is).","Jul 18, 2007",5,/10

"Sitting in this movie I kept thinking ""its going to get better, it must get better!"" but I was so wrong. I was surprised to see a lot of over saturated/structured cgi shots but that's not what I'd call BAD. What was bad first of all was not one character was likable in the whole movie. Not Mark Wahlberg, not the Irish dude, not even Optimus prime! Take Mark Wahlberg's character for instance, he was a over-protective crappy inventor who was not able to provide for his family. The whole movie sets you up to think he is going to invent something good(think Hugh Jackman in Real Steel) but nope. Not one good invention. He's just a moody guy who's mad because he finds out his daughter has a boyfriend and you get to hear him whine about it the rest of the movie. Not a good Wahlberg role. The autobots were also annoying they seemed kind of like spoiled kids. Doing whatever they wanted and when faced with danger they ran away with their tails between their legs. Now for the comic relief. It was annoying in most cases. Each character pretty much took part in what I call ""dumb comedy"" where the character says something really dumb that turns out being funny. That works most of the time but when every character is doing it whether it's in their character profile or not, it ruins anything they had going for them. Most of this comedy was so frequent and redundant that it became annoying very quickly. And then we have the script. Good gosh, EVERY line was so bad it was laughable. I was seriously shaking my head for almost the entire film which was close to 3 hours by the way. That's a long time to sit in one place for even a good movie. Needless to say I was glad when it ended. I was so surprised to hear people clapping when the movie came to an end but the smidgen of hope for humanity in me would like to think they were clapping because it finally ended rather than showing their approval for the movie. As soon as it ended I had to look up the director and writer and I was surprised to see that they have done some decent movies previously. I don't know what happened with this one but I haven't heard a script this bad since The Host (2013) and before that probably The Last Airbender (2010). Redeeming qualities? I doubt there are any. Maybe some cool sound effects and 1 or 2 jokes that were actually funny but even then I felt embarrassed to laugh. At the end of the day, all of this has given me more respect for Shia LaBeouf because the last transformers movie with the same crew was 10 times better than this one.","Jun 27, 2014",5,/10
"Word to the wise: If a film makes $300 million without being a sequel, chances are it's probably a good film.I wish I adhered to this lesson sooner because I ended up stumbling upon this movie inadvertently (I was waiting for another movie to start and wandered into the Transformers theater) and I was fortunate to discover THE event picture of the summer even if it was eight weeks past its release and there was no one left who hadn't seen it that I could proclaim it's greatness to.Produced by Stephen Spielberg and directed by Michael Bay, I'm happy to report that between the clash of these two creative visionaries (or should I say one creative visionary and a guy whose primary interest as a movie director is making things explode), that the end result is a movie that's far more Spielberg than it is Bay. Transformers plays out along the lines of Spielberg's ""Things are best seen from a children's point of view"" theme that is most closely associated with E.T. Along the lines of this E.T. analogy, massive credit goes to the casting department for using Shia LeBouf in the ""Drew Barrymore"" role, because he is largely the reason the film works so well. Charismatic, a little vulnerable, and witty, Shia LeBouf balances the heavy mythology with lighthearted fun reminiscent of Han Solo's role in Star Wars. I think it's also a good bet that like Harrison Ford, Shia LeBouf will enjoy a rich and long-lived career.While coming off as the second coming of E.T., the film also has a touch of Roland Emmerich films like The Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day where the impossible task of trying to portray an entire planet as it deals with a global attack is portrayed through a cross-section of people whose story lines weave closer together as the plot progresses and there were plenty of interesting characters from Jon Voight's airhead Secretary of defense (a little reminiscent of Rumsfeld but a slightly better listener) to Jon Turturro as a special agent to Rachel Taylor as a sexy intelligent computer programmer to Megan Fox as a very compelling girl-next-door type who commands the protagonist's interest.Of course, with Michael Bay as the director, the action gets a little excessive (especially in the final battle scene), but ultimately, the film is all about character and that's what makes it memorable","Aug 28, 2007",3,/10
"This film is action packed and a total graphics overhaul for the eyes and ears. The talent it takes to put all those characters together to transform and fight at the same time is just incredible. That being said, the writing for this movie is absolute garbage. It has so many plot holes, it couldn't transform into a shovel to dig itself out. And what's with the face pausing? I get you are trying to do a ""Spielberg impression"" but it's always in the most awkward moments of the movie. 18 years later this movie is still visually amazing, the human actors did their best why what they were give. And they put in 100%. But take out all the graphics and this is one of the worst written movies and I feel sorry for the amazing actors who had to perform those lines.","Dec 14, 2024",5,/10

"For those of us who HAVE watched The ""Transformers"" growing up, this movie was just too ""busy"" and, at some point, confusing. The movie was supposed to be about Transformers not the wacky people around them. Who cares about them?! The movie introduces people who are not part of the genre as if they matter to the plot. They don't! It's supposed to be about the war between the Autobots and Decepticons, but there was too much talking among people about nothing. Granted, the transforming was cool, but it felt like it took forever for 1 Transformer to change.At some point, I was looking at my watch to see how long it took Optimus Prime to go from truck to robot. In the cartoon, you heard the ""transforming noise"" and a few seconds later he was in another form. In this movie, I could leave for popcorn and come back to see him still transforming.The view of the robots was so ""busy"" and cluttered, you couldn't recognize which robot was which. If a robot died, you couldn't tell who it was. In my opinion, I vote ""no"" on this movie because the hype on it is misleading...And the dialogue, who writes this stuff!...","Jul 5, 2007",4,/10

"After a good movie, you recap the plot, characters, and favorite scenes as a form of ""after-entertainment."" After watching ""Transformers,"" however, I could only think whether I liked the movie or not. Although I praise the awesome CGI and the fact I was a die-hard for Transformers as a kid, the movie is painfully nostalgic.""Before time began, there wasthe cube"" booms a resounding voice-over of the omniscient Optimus Prime. Oh sure, that means the cube is antimatter. Yet when I tuned into every half hour Transformers animated TV show as a kid, I could care less about the physics of the picture. Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" has been a success at the popular level because nobody cares to rethink the impossible and ridiculous. I dare not to claim that those who liked his movie are mindless goofs. The movie doesn't deserve to be digested for its plot and meaning; ""Transformers"" is like a cigarette buzz that you want to last a bit but rewatch with guilt.With much merit, I liked Bay's ""Transformers"" because of its sweet CGI work and kinetics of robot battle. The most exciting but brief parts were the swift transformations between vehicle to robot and back, where you can see the dynamics and structures of its individual parts. Yet all the CGI and the pounding sound of twisted metal reminded me of watching football (and probably both more entertaining over several beers) where the entertained gets torn apart while I sit through the ordeal of both teams pushing and pulling over the fifty-yard-line, all in two and a half hours.In the end, as a long-lost Transformers fan, I go home and dig through my old childhood toys to find my Transformers collection. I feel sorry and I have the urge to cry over them because I miss my childhood, when my mind could not fathom the intricacy of plot, character, and believability of movie adaptations of my once-favorite toy.","Jul 5, 2007",5,/10

It doesn't work as a good action film, because it lacks anything of interest to invest in - the biggest offender being the paper thin characters - and it has an abomination of a screenplay with cringe-worthy attempts at humour from every direction.I was actually bored by this film.

But then a plot starts that nobody cares about comes along and blows up the movie. There isn't enough corny dialogue that's needed to get us in. This kind of thing needs quirks. It feels like any other movie you see. That's my slogan. Cool robots, yet any other movie you see. There really isn't much to say about it other than go watch something more creative. Stick with the old Terminator movies.","Apr 20, 2015",4,/10
"Michael Bay is simply an 'overdirector', that works when it comes to over-the-top and wacky action sequences, but when it comes to almost everything else, it is very mediocre.I don't know who wrote this film but they've probably never had an actual conversation in real-life because characters here don't talk like normal people. There are too many characters, and the film wants you to like all of them but you end up not liking any because of the lack of characterisation. It's very outdated, but it can weirdly give off a nice late 2000s MBC2 film vibe. The entirety of the way the action is directed in the last act is great, Bay is very skilled in terms of directing movement and action, but not every scene needs to feel like it's an action scene, you can slow down. The CGI and overall VFX on the AutoBots has aged insanely well and still looks great almost 16 years later, the machines feel so tangible because of their grounded design and textures.For these types of films you come for the action sequences and crazy Transformer battles, even if most of the AutoBots either lack any personality or are too cartoonish, but unfortunately those are sidelined by uninteresting characters and weak actors, along with a mediocre script and a film that takes itself too seriously for an absurd concept.","Sep 3, 2023",5,/10

"First the good news...Transformers was a fantastic and imaginative adventure. Just read the other users' comments.Now the bad news...The obvious, subliminal, General Motors car commercial that Transformers is, insults my intelligence, and illustrates just how polluted the movie industry, corporate America, and the Federal Trade Regulations of the United States have become. It should be illegal. Actually, I think it is illegal. And this auto commercial, I believe, targets young viewers, children, and goes so far as to elevate the automobile to the status of hidden, mystical guardian of our world, which it actually has been destroying with pollution for about a century, now.

"Michael Bay certainly has a style.First and most obviously, the special effects throughout almost this movie are amazing. The texture work and lighting on the models of the Transformers hasn't aged a day, but the animation on the other hand has. A lot of the most off-putting moments in the movie come from the way the robots are animated, and the lack of real world weight they have.Every character is a cartoon character, the humor is so extremely immature and weird (sometimes it does make me chuckle, though,) both protagonists have zero chemistry, and because of the focus on the human characters, the Transformers themselves lack any sort of depth or character.The action was fine, but it wasn't ever really anything that blew me away. Every single time an action scene between the Transformers would begin, it would instantly cut to whatever the humans were doing, leaving me with a perpetual sense of blue balls throughout the entire movie.","Dec 29, 2024",5,/10
"Transformers is a franchise that was born out of the need to make money. And yet, it grew beyond being just another '80s toy marketing scheme into it's own distinct universe and tone. It had a soul. It was one of those things where all you had to do was take one look at it and go, ""That's Transformers."" But this movie has no soul. It does not revolve around Optimus Prime and the Autobots fighting a (somehow) covert war against the Decepticons. No, this movie revolves around the adventures of Shia LaBeouf and his Styrofoam-bland girlfriend Megan Fox getting in over their heads and delivering exposition.Now, I know what you're thinking: ""It's got the giant robots in it, and that's all I need."" Well, you know how in the cartoons there's always an explosion of color whenever sheit goes down, accompanied by kick-ass music? Yeah, this movie, and ALL of Bay's Transformers movies, have none of that. The fights take place in this eerie silence and all of the unique colors of both the Autobots and the Decepticons are lost under a pile of chrome. The Transformers themselves are unrecognizable aside from Optimus and the sound of the Transformers changing from vehicles to bots always made my skin crawl.""Soulless""...

But apart from that... well, there were a few amusingly awkward, teen-angst moments as Shia Leboeuf and his ironic Camaro tried to get Mr Leboeuf to hook up with the bad-girl hottie (played by Megan Fox).The whole affair seems overly long, and at 144 minutes it undoubtedly is. How this film took three whole people to come up with the story is baffling.The acting as a whole is wooden. Except when the robots start talking, then it it gets past wooden. (What is a word for worse than wooden but with a healthy dose of puerile?). But let's face it the action is what this movie is about - and the cars are the stars.A highlight? If I'm forced to pick one, it would be the Bernie Mac cameo.A lowlight? If I'm forced to pick ONLY one, it would have to be John Turturro's out of place turn as the goof-ball secret spy. He was the only one not playing it straight.We really should not expect much from a Michael Bay (Bad Boys, Bad Boys 2) directed film apart from explosions and car chases. On this showing, he really is nothing more than an average music video director with delusions of grandeur.","Jul 18, 2007",5,/10

I believe this movie could have been great if they didn't try to cater to just the new generation of kids. The vehicles obviously couldn't stay the same, but not all of them needed to be GM. Someone who grew up watching the cartoons as a kid would have been a better choice as a director.","Jan 2, 2019",3,/10

I mean the action scenes are pretty cool, but it just felt like the last scene ended so abruptly.The action in the last scene felt like it was going on for a long while, but it ended so suddenly. I mean the last fight did feel like it was dragging on, but they ended it in just such a weird way that it just felt like there could of been a bit more for a more dramatic ending.My favorite scene of the movie was the last scene with Optimus Prime's speech that ends with the iconic LINKIN PARK - What I've Done. I mean to me that is top 5 credit songs to a movie, it might even be my favorite so that definitely upped my rating for this movie.Overall it's a good family movie but not a movie that will have you mesmerized too long after watching.","Dec 24, 2024",5,/10

"Transformers, whatever you may think, became a successful franchise spawning four sequels and has grossed billions of dollars. While the movies went 
down terribly with critics, particularly the sequels, audiences rushed to see the spectacular action despite the films having stereotypical characters and basic blockbuster storylines. I used to think the first movie was fine, nothing groundbreaking but I did admire the action and sound design. I didn't think it was the next Star Wars or Spielberg masterpiece, just acceptable blockbuster entertainment. I decided to watch the film for the first time in ages and while it isn't the worst, it hasn't aged well either. Many issues critics highlighted with the sequels are also present in the first, just to a lesser extent. There's stereotypes, shouty characters, inappropriate sexual innuendos and voyeurism in addition to excessive action. On the positive side, the story is straightforward and the Transformers themselves are entertaining. The effort the CG people went into putting every detail of the transformations is astounding and the sound design is also top notch.While it does have a comprehensible story and isn't as awful as the sequels, I can't say this is a good or underrated movie amidst an infamous franchise, even though I'd like to. I do think there was effort put into this first one and wasn't made solely to get a check, but regardless it's a dumb movie which was fun back in the naughties but not so much nowadays.","Feb 8, 2018",5,/10
"A mildly diverting way to spend an hour and a half and in no way offensive to my sensibilities. However, it was very forgettable - which for a big budget spectacle movie is a problem.I was never a fan of the original cartoons (I was entirely indifferent to them), so I had little expectation of this film, as well as no preconceived notions as to what it should be.But I was totally unprepared for the incredibly camp huge robots! At various points I almost expected them to finish their sentences with ""Ooh get you!"" and ""You b1tch!"" These were not awesome intergalactic killing machines, they were more whiny, sensitive, over-friendly, overly sincere politically correct accounting software managed virtual learning environments. And about as exciting.The scene around the outside of the house was nothing short of high farce, and actually quite fun. But when the credits rolled I was confused.Who was this film aimed at? From the trailer I was expecting a hard edged, dark and violent vision of a future where earth becomes the battleground for a titanic struggle between massively powerful war machines from the far reaches of the cosmos.What I got was a kids film with big robots who were about as frightening as a small toy that turns from a plane into a Nissan hatchback.","Mar 11, 2009",4,/10

"Too much action and not enough character or story development. Michael Bay seems to think that if he shoots impressive action sequences (like he did in Pearl Harbour for example) then he thinks the movie will work. But it doesn't. Typically, his movies begin with people trying to connect sexually-there is always some reference to that (this is almost traditional - see Armageddon and Pearl Harbour). I can tell that almost every Michael Bay movie will have some sort of love/romance in the beginning. OK, it is a big part of life but the way Michael Bay presents it is so typically Hollywoodish and unoriginal. I don't like the way filmmakers throw romance in every movie nowadays. It seems they feel like they have to include romance as if it is an obligation. That's why, it feels completely unnatural and unconvincing. Same comments apply to the humor in the movie (so cliché and predictable). I haven't seen the Transformers cartoon or read the comic book so I cannot comment on that but this movie seemed to me unoriginal and poorly constructed piece of cinema without any real value except for visual effects, which is why I gave 4 out of 10.","Jul 20, 2007",4,/10

I get why nostalgia kicked in for many, and I'll grant this - fx were 'decent' however, the entire movie is a smoking pile of.....Acting is somewhere between mediocre and downright atrocious - Megan Fox heading that list.I won't bore you with my drivel - just save your time and NEVER watch this steaming crap.The End.","Dec 11, 2021",1,/10
"Firstly, let's get the obligatory bit out of the way - yes I am a fan of G1 Transformers, however I was not expecting a direct adaptation, had given Bay the benefit of the doubt and had even come to like the new designs.I expected a film with a lot of action, but little plot - as long as there was plenty of action, robots fighting and transformation. The film fell short in both departments - in action and in plot.Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of action, however not consistently throughout the movie and in particular the very, very brief encounters with some of the Transformers compared to the length of time spent with 2-dimensional, cheesy human actors.Whilst not expecting a good plot there are still expectations that there should be one, and certainly an action film should be remembered for its action sequences and not an analysis of the many gaping and open-ended plot holes. The film is very unbalanced leaving a lot of the expected action crammed into a 'suger rush' at the end, with a very long, drawnout and not very interesting hour or so sandwhiched between great action, good humour and character development. By the time the real action sequences came around I was so bored and disinterested I didn't actually care - a good plot needs to carry viewer empathy otherwise it's no better than a video game.Bay's greatest problem with this was in trying to make the film credible and based on real physics as there are moments in this film that throw that whole concept out of the window, and the minute you stop 'believing' the film is when you see it is no more realistic or 'adult' than the cartoons. For such a simple, childish plot, why have it a 12a certificate? One or the other - is it for adults or for kids? In short, the robots are great but the plot is embarrassing. Hopefully the sequel will be better thought-out.","Jul 22, 2007",4,/10

"Finally broke down and gave this film a chance. Was a big Transformers fan when I was a kid, more of the toys than the cartoon. So I saw the commercial for the sequel and decided I would finally rent this one, I am often amazed at movies with giant budgets like this one. Ultimately they seem to have no sense of themselves. They are so far gone from reality, and not even close to enjoyable. I am not talking about about far-fetched concepts like transforming alien lifeforms that just so happen to look an awful lot like cars and planes of our world. You suspend that disbelief when you buy a ticket, or rent this movie. But so much unnecessary dialog, and situations. I feel like the premise for how this concept (transforming robots locked in mortal combat)was going to be handled was ill-conceived at best. Michael Bay. I won't go into it too much. I'd be here all day. I'll just say, his visuals are absolutely stunning, but there is NOTHING holding them together. Total, total hack. I wanted to watch an action film that I could just shut my brain off and enjoy. Unfortunately I just can't force myself to be stupid enough for this film. Now G.I. Joe may fall next.

"A Michael Bay movie for sure. First the action is definitely the best part of the movie, it has some cool moments and the CGI is cool and overall it's pretty decent; but sometimes it's just so hard to see what is even happening and sometimes it feels like just cgi metal clashing together rather than big robots fighting and the random human people that have POVs watching the robots fight is extremely random and stupid. The story, characters, and dialogue should bring this movie down way further, but it's consistently so silly and dumb throughout all of the artificial characters that it remains entertaining and funnier than any of the terrible jokes that are made in the movie. Like a Michael Bay movie, it is an hour and a half fun action-packed ride stretched out to 2 and a half hours with many side characters and side plots and random dumb dialogue.","May 24, 2022",5,/10
"First of all, the movie has multitudes of continuity errors and sloppy story writing. I expected a lot from this film with the budget they had, but unfortunately, it turned out to be another Godzilla 1998. Much like Godzilla, there's little focus on the main characters, being the robots themselves, and more on the US military and a sexual endeavor that carries throughout the film making you wonder why they didn't just call the movie Sex Pistols.Probably to suit the outcome of being destroyed by lowly humans, the robots were designed to be extremely weak. Most of the Decepticons are dispatched by the military quite easily, bringing into question as to why the Autobots need to ""protect"" anything for that matter. Heck, they should've just went wild and started destroying everything. Though the property damage they've caused saving the world alone might be enough.The absence of character development for the robots is prominent. Most of them come out of nowhere near the end of the movie and some have absolutely no dialog whatsoever. Bay failed to see any reason to develop their personalities. One of the dozens of continuity errors is that some of the Decepticons just vanish into thin air during the freeway chase. The Autobots and the military are supposed to protect sentient life, bringing into question as to why they brought the final battle into a civilian population for no reason at all. Also, the whole point of the Transformers arrival on Earth is to look for a device called the All Spark. In a few scenes, two Decepticons (Starscream and Blackout) are in reach of the human character who has the device, but in each instance, they transform and leave instead of killing and relieving him of it.Of course, the generic story about the guy getting the girl surfaces at the finale. Both Bay and the writers failed miserably to depict the heart of the Transformers, and made it into a film about anything but. Hopefully, Hasbro will take the franchise to a more capable movie studio other than Paramount and their terrible sci-fi writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Is it any wonder why the Star Trek movies have gone to shame?In the end, don't expect to see the Transformers you've grown to love, because they don't live here.","Jul 20, 2007",2,/10

The graphics were AWESOME !! The transformers themselves and the final fight sequences was something extraordinary. But sadly thats all there is to it. The first half of the movie was real fun to watch but then after we are introduced to all the robots , there is nothing much left in the movie. I mean , its great to watch them transform , but how many times do we want to watch that? The final fight scenes were awesome , but it also was a bit confusing as to who is getting hit? Are those the good guys or is it the bad guys who are losing (of course the bad guys are losing .... but its so damn confusing) . Maybe its just cos i am not so well versed with all the Autobots and Decepticons, but what the heck?? On the whole its strictly for Fans and a must watch for CGI fanatics!!","Jul 5, 2007",5,/10
"When a magician repeats his repertoire through out their entire career, no matter how flashy it is, it gets old fast. Michael Bay is he cinema equivalent. Visually impressive? That's just a cover up to disguise his inability to engage a satisfactory story arc/line in any of his films. Ever notice whenever the dialogue (if there are any) runs dry there's always a spectacular explosion or two to distract the audience? The poor acting and the unbelievable sub-par script have been additionally littered with awkward not-at-all-funny comedic moments and the strangely frequent misplaced sexual connotations. The scene jumps from here to there without any coherence and the whole film structurally is one big mess. I kid you not, if you have the intelligence to look past the glitz and candy (applies to another Bay film for that matter), you'll find it's just one big nothing of a waste of a reel.","Aug 29, 2008",2,/10

"...I enjoyed this. The plot takes a few leaps in logic, but this is as to be expected for a movie about giant robots who transform into cars and assorted vehicles. Actually until the transformers speak it's a semi- realistic sci-fi film, after which it's just the Transformers cartoon, ""we are good they are evil, let's fight!"", which they do a lot of, which pleased me. It's basically a boys with toy's story, except the car to win the dream girl is sentient and out to save the earth. The films big draw is that giant robots trash each other in a crowded metropolitan area, and that was present. If this kind of thing doesn't interest you, your probably not gonna like this. Occasionally it was difficult for me to establish who was fighting who, until I realized this didn't matter, and was able to enjoy in my childish(infantile) fantasy comes to life before me. The original Animated film is actually a much more unique and stylized experience, but this was good too, by good I mean ""special effects/action scenarios"", nothing else worth mentioning.

"The only reason this nonsense didn't get a 1 was due to Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas). He was the only highlight for me. The rest of the cast was made of shallow, uninteresting people. Not that I expected more from an action flick but just saying. Jon Voight and John Turturro are two fine actors who are wasted in this film. This movie tried so hard to elicit laughs in between the action and failed miserably each time. Anthony Anderson was just not funny. The interrogation scene with the donuts was like a bad sitcom where you could see the punch line a mile away. The blonde Australian girl who outsmarted national security was just ridiculous. As for the action, it was hard to keep track of which machine was which. Just hunks of metal tearing each other apart. The cartoon had much better fighting scenes more than 20 years ago! Pathetic. Also Optimus Prime was a heck of a lot stronger in the cartoon than in the movie. He was at least Megatron's match. In the movie, he clearly had inferior strength.

"i didn't expect much form this adaptation but nevertheless i was disappointed.to begin with the good part: of course, the sfx were stunning (1 point); but by times the movements of the robots during the fight scenes were so fast that it is hard to tell the good robots from the bad ones.but then: there is practically no plot. there is NO dramatic development of the scenes: every scene starts with an explosion or an attack without any preparation, thrill or suspense (nor even surprise). and the worst of all: the dialog is absolutely ridiculous and stupid throughout the hole movies. not one sentence hasn't been in at least 100 other movies (inclusivly the introduction of a catchphrase, full of pathos of course, in the beginning that will be picked up again at the end - a method that always makes me nauseous). not to speak of the apologetic (and politically dangerous) depiction of military ""heroism"" i.e. violence.the only silver lining was john turturro who manages to bring some humor and satiric twist into the movies - therefore two points.","Aug 21, 2007",2,/10

"Its always hard to convert a previous media into a film and pull of something that can be defined as excellent. There is no doubt that Bay had intentions of doing this but all he has delivered is soulless piece of work with some good special effects. The Transformers story is one of simplicity and for that Bay and his screenwriters cannot be blamed, however they can be blamed for the awful dialogue given to the characters and the cliché images of each and every character in the film. They are all so one dimensional and predictable that there is no interest to be found in any of them. The movie is at its purist sense a dummed down 'hollywood-enised' expression of the Transformers brand. Its saving grace are its action scenes where meticulous effort has been put into the effects, but even these are far too monotonous that after about the fourth one you beginning to get rather tired of the whole concept of giant robot aliens battling one another. To those who like a shallow explosion filled action flick than this is for you, but for those who like depth to a movie then certainly avoid this one.","Dec 10, 2009",3,/10

"Let me paraphrase my summary theme. I remember a lot of pioneers films who leaded a totally new era by the aid of digital camera, CG, etc..There are many movies which deserves to be called a ""landmark""in SiFi movies. For example, E.T. Starwars, T2..As time goes by, it appears that computer graphic technology gets much more core things in making films more and more....Now nothing is impossible in the name of CG. making thousands of mob(Lord of the rings), completely complicated battle scene(Matrix), and much more.. Now what remains in the sketch note of the CG designers?now it is definite that Hollywood keep their eyes on making cartoons REAL. Spiderman, Gozilla, X-man..and finally , Transformer. The first impression of this movie to me is, perfect realization of Japanese animation which I am so familiar since young.Motive is very much like classical Jap. animations(Steelman No.28, Gundam,etc..)Boy, and gigantic android with transformation capability, and romance...so classical.Seeing this movie, from start to end I could not resist myself feeling as if I had been seeing an animation. Again, CG is now cooler than animation movie. And, CG takes already too much room in Movie business and structure, so CONTENTS of the work is behind that. Whether this movie's plot is good or bad, earth-breaking CG makes this film almighty.","Jul 10, 2007",5,/10

May be an excellent film for the fans but for me it was an very long and slow movie with great CGI that had Michael Bay action film written all over it.My God this was long. They could have shortened it from its 2 and a half hours to at least 1 hour and a half. The scenes just went on and on and on.Acting was not so good. Shia LaBeouf was good as the main character. Megan Fox was horrible. Not a good actor at all. Josh Duhamel(from Las Vegas)was good. I bet this will do a lot for his career.Now to the good things. As i said before the CGI was amazing the action scenes were well done but thats all that is worth mentioning.I only recommend this if you are a fan of the cartoon.

"You could cut out an hour of: subplots that don't add to the story, multiple ""new"" characters that appear to be of initial importance but go nowhere, and scenes that could be told in a minute that seem to drag on and on and on...The first ten minutes and the last thirty are diamonds, and hopefully my kids will remember those action packed moments rather than the overused teenage-romance-angst subplot, the Dad/Mom/Son masturbation conversation (I half expected my oldest to come out of the theatre repeating ""masturbation, masturbation, masturbation"" as his new word), and the very stupid Taco Bell dog with the broken leg and addiction to pain medication. Yes, I don't have a clue to why that and a dozen other useless things were in a movie about giant robots.Rent it first, fast forward through the parts that make you yawn (there are plenty), enjoy the really wicked robot vs. robot battle scenes, then return to your video store.DeadboneOn a technical note: when a C-130 gunship pumps several thousand rounds per minute of munitions on a target - in this case a very bad robot - military guys caught within a fifty foot radius don't just stand around and watch.

"I DVR'd this in high def and was really looking forward to a cool movie with good transformers in titanic battles against the bad transformers. It just seemed like I was watching another one of those movies like Independence Day where they just couldn't help but try to inject corny lines and ruin the movie by making it seem unrealistically staged and I just could never immerse myself into the plot. It was another formula ""teenage"" movie (and I hate to use that term because it has nothing to do with teenagers, but rather has to do with writers and producers and directors talking down to teenagers thinking this is what they want). I hate it when Hollywood takes a multi-million dollar budget and a cool subject and then turns it into schmaltzy crap like this. Why not make it more ""realistically staged"" with a more serious tone the way people would really be acting like if Transformers really did start a huge battle on our planet? If I was a director of a movie like this, I would let the plot and story breathe in an atmosphere of serious realism. Be subtle with humor and effects. Don't just start blasting it at the audience with both barrels for the entire duration. Thanks for screwing up another potentially great movie Hollywood.","Aug 24, 2008",3,/10

In stead of intelligent and awesome transforming robots we get goofey action with a weak plot. Some characters are scary close to Jar Jar.

"I could have saved the price of admission by stringing a couple dozen tin cans together, swinging them around in a circle, throwing them up in the air and letting them come down on my head fifty times or so, pausing only to sneak an occasional look at the mean-looking lady down the block.

If you choose to do it my way, be very sure to swing those cans around really fast, so you'll be good and dizzy when they hit you in the head. That way, you'll experience the director's technique of constantly revolving the camera around the actors and the tin cans, whether it needs to be or not.Hmm...

"I grew up watching Transformers: Armada, a popular anime that ran for many years and was as epic as an anime can get. I had all the cool toys and comics. My brother and I were die-hard fans of Transformers. In my adolescent years, when I heard that there would be a live-action Transformers, my heart immediately started pounding with excitement. I was too young at the time to realize that the Hollywood industry ruins movies like these.Let me just say that Michael Bay completely destroyed the universe that was Transformers. The series that made my childhood was bashed and beaten right before my very eyes. Not to mention that most guys in the theater were distracted by Megan Fox's appearance and couldn't really care less about the plot. Maybe I'm just angry because I was such a devoted fan to the anime. I know that it's hard to walk in the steps of an anime with a live-action film, but Michael Bay went too far. I didn't even bother watching the following Transformers that were released.Also, there was no Hot Shot!!! What's the deal with that?!?!","Dec 18, 2015",3,/10

"Transformers is a mixed bag. For every great moment, there's something corny and annoying to counteract it, resulting in a patchy viewing experience that's watchable but filled with flaws that stop the film from being first rate.The transformers themselves look amazing; they are well realised visual effects that are stunning to watch. But whenever they're not on screen (which, sadly, is often) you have to sit through a holey plot that focuses on tons of one dimensional soldier and geeky hacker characters who do not need to be there. The only interesting human characters are the witwicky family who are a likable, quirky bunch .If the transformers and the witwickys were the main focus of the movie then things would be a lot easier on the attention span .What's great about the film is its sense of humour, the jokes are well timed and hit their mark perfectly (although some of the humour is unintentional).Even the autobots are in on the chuckles (look out for what bumble bee does to john tutorro) .Surprisingly, things are a bit disappointing on the action side of things. Sure, there are huge action sequences but they are so poorly shot and edited that you'll have to squint to see them . You'd think that Michael bay would want the audience to have a clear uninterrupted view of the millions of dollars worth of robot action on screen , but puzzlingly he does the exact opposite and decides to shoot almost every action sequence with violently shaky, amateurish camera work. Not recommended for anyone with motion sickness......Transformers is filled with annoying and unnecessary bits but it's a watchable film with great visual effects and a welcome sense of humour.","Aug 2, 2007",5,/10

"As of the time of this review, Transformers has a 7.7 rating on this site. I would give it a definite 8 for the special effects, but it just so happens that I rate pictures for the strength of the storyline as well. For that, I give a 2. This is an excellent film for the prepubescent and adolescent boys; non-stop military and machine action! Did I mention it was non-stop? Any adult with attention deficit disorder should also like it, it may very well be the first film that is a distraction to itself. Mind-boggling computer animation built around a two and a half hour commercial for General Motors products might work better in the typical thirty second format. If Transformers hadn't been based on a toy, I would have guessed by the product placement that GMC had bank-rolled this project. Great film for kids, a total yawner for the adult viewer with discerning taste in cinema.","Dec 8, 2007",4,/10
"How Spielberg ever became one of the most famous directors becomes a very imposing question after spending the evening yawning away at Transformers. A few laughs here and there, but mostly cliché after cliché, and 200 tonnes robots acting like ninja Turtles. No plot worth mentioning, unless one was a fan of Transformers as a kid. Let me outline a few things that turns me off Transformers. The government calls in all the best encryption experts from around the country. A room full of people. The hero in this gathering just happens to be a 23 year old insanely beautiful woman from Australia. She contacts the best hacker in the world, leading to a scene more or less identical to the ""meet the hacker""-scene i Die Hard 4. Cliché 1. Buff sports fanatics vs. weak schoolboy hero. cliché 2. An evil alien miniature robot with comic relief sounds. Did anyone say Jarjar binks (annoyment level similar). A heroic robot clad i red white and blue armor. A heroic soldier who in the opening scene underlines his love for his wife and kid.... Rock and roll family guy, upholding the virtues of Christian America. A heroin sidekick with teeth as white as paper. Just a plain boring film with nothing new to add to film history. As childish as ET but without the charm. A tour de force in CGI, but still not enough to raise my pulse 1 beat.","Jan 16, 2008",4,/10
"Okay, I'm going to flat out say that this is the worst live action adaptation of a popular 80s cartoon and toy franchise. Transformers was my favorite show from my childhood. (Even though they were reruns.) I collected the toys, (G1 and Beast Wars) and watched any adaptation from Beast Wars up to Armada and Energon. When i heard about this movie, my thought was OK better see it. I was dead wrong. After watching what i saw it officially killed my childhood. There were some good things about it, the special effects were cool, the voice cast was awesome especially hearing Peter Cullen's voice again. (I was happy bout that.) The downsides were a combination of the following: poor storyline, very bad cheesy acting and Megan Fox. What was her purpose of the movie? NONE. Sex appeal, OK but in this case, NO! Another downside is the fact that out of all the transformers, they leave out the 2 best ones: Hot Rod and Cliffjumper What would have made this movie better would be better story writing and character development.","Mar 25, 2012",4,/10
"Don't tell those robots that I told you this; they are very sensitive. Transformers is an adequate film adaptation. What it lacks in plot it makes up for in extraordinary animation and effects. It all begins on the premise that there are ancient intelligent robots out there in the universe, fighting a millennium long war. I trust that you already know this. It also begins as so many movies do, with a dude humiliating himself to impress a girl (Mikaela=Megan Fox), a real fox. Who didn't see that coming? The plot of the film is minimal at best, a set of short stories haphazardly assembled into a dizzying adventure. It might have been the filmmaker's intention, to create a pseudo documentary. The script is also believable, with very little thought put into it as if the actors were winging it. Maybe they were? One thing that is unmistakable is that the effects will be unmatched for years to come. A solid 1/2.","Jul 27, 2007",5,/10
Who agrees that this doesn't capture the same feeling that the cartoons have? You know I watched it and didn't hate it or anything but it just doesn't feel the same.The effects are good as you would expect but there is also something about the transformers that looks wrong. I think it is how there metal doesn't look solid or thick. It's all too shiny! The stars are to much like you would come to expect from a standard American film. Block busters can be good but I just don't think this director has heart. He likes to blow stuff up and make everything shiny and have a fake lens flare!,"Oct 7, 2009",3,/10
"It is now the year 2007 and the time-line of the infamous robot wars from deep space that started back in the nineteen eighties and throughout the last thirty years has transmogrified into what we see hear today. Michael Bay's translation of this highly regarded cult is a more than modest attempt to not just widen the appeal of this sci-fi phenomenon but to use the technology of modern film-making to its full potential. While potentially seeming to be a teen movie, with its young cast of heroes set against over bearing, but kind and loving, parents, the generation gap never seems so agonisingly embarrassing, but comical, to our young hero here and the authoritative figures that wouldn't look out of place in the next Men in Black movie, Transformers is a wonderful action and adventure sci-fi that can, and should, appeal across the broad.With the Autobots, the good guys, and the Decepticons both gunning for the same prize; Sam Witwicky, the unwitting teen who holds the one article that can save or destroy the planet, it now depends on which clan of robot will reach him first.With its origins forming in nineteen seventies Japanese culture, these tiny toys were taken overseas by the American toy company Hasbro (My Little Pony, Monopoly, Twister) near the mid nineteen eighties. After this jump from the Rising Sun to the land of prosperity it was now time for these tiny 'bots to make a big impression on the minds of a new and willing culture: The Transformers had arrived.This is pure Hollywood, pure Stars and Stripes, and being slightly a little formalistic in its delivery, with seemingly one dimensional and stereotypical caricatures, it isn't that bad a job in its more physical attributes. Whilst not altogether weak characters, some deeper development might have given this movie more scope, but, this isn't what Transformers is about, with its ethos of all action, all razzmatazz in its main concept of world domination by metallic ET's, this was never going to be a deep social comment on the subject of war and peace.Divided into two acts, the first being the introduction of our characters and 'bots, with, at times, an amusing and witty dialogue, exciting action that captivates this theme well, not too slow and not too rushed; intriguing and more than capable both in the visual and physical aspects of this genre, there really is a fine blend to keep the ball rolling in the right direction, to prep us readily for the second act.With Michael Bay utilising his skill of vision, direction and imagination it isn't long before the second act kicks in, when all are sitting comfortably in their respective roles it is now time for the action to kick in proper. It is the second act that we see these motorised warriors in their prime, it is the visual believability that holds its own, and the action and pace never lets up for a moment, this fighting of the metal giants is stupendous, fighting among the city streets and skies, if this had been ""scratch and sniff"" then we would more than quiver in our seats; This is where modern movie making takes a bow and it is the work of Academy Award winner (Cocoon (1985)) Scott Farrar, Visual Effects Supervisor, and his achievement at winning the 2007 Hollywood Film Festival ""Visual Effects Supervisor of the Year"" Award. His work on Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) and Jurassic Park (1993) et al show wonderment at his ability to make us believe that these robots are not mere fantasy but are actually among us, working larger than life size models of their tiny counterparts that seems now so far away from the early days of nineteen seventies Japan.","Dec 4, 2007",4,/10
"I am a big fan of cheesy and exaggerated action, but this one disappointed me. It is a shame - I was looking forward to it, even though it was based on a toy-franchise. I find the idea of giant robots fighting each other oddly exciting - if it well made. But there is too little memorable action. There was too little, too late. The movie seem to run in slo-mo, then there is absolute chaos, then it is slow again, some chaos, boring, and finally, self-righteous end. I give it 3. Will not watch again. Some bad things: It has been directed by a donkey. It is too long. It gets very dull. It is too self-important. It is too sentimental. It focuses too much on teen-romance and ""Dawson"". It has very weak character definition. The robots aren't introduced properly, one doesn't get to know them. The robots are stiff and have no significant or memorable traits. There is also a contradiction in length and the shallow toys-concept: This movie is, on the one hand, very long and self-important. The music is sentimental and the plot and mood feels like it's trying to be moving. On the other hand, the movie tries to be young and fun. Both cannot be achieved in one work. Cannot recommend.","Oct 1, 2013",3,/10
"In his 1982 book ""Danse Macabre"", Stephen King predicted that the future of bad films was not cheap and cheesy films like the works of Ed Wood and Phil Tucker, but glossy, expensive films of the same quality; films which amounted to the celluloid equivalent of ""a dead rat in a Lucite block"". While he has had as extensive and successful a career as a writer as anyone could imagine, surely he has never written anything else as insightful or accurate. Exhibit A: Transformers, one of the biggest hits of 2007. Here we have a movie with a plot that would have barely sufficed for an episode of the cartoon on which it was based. You remember, that cartoon that existed exclusively to sell toys. This film also ""treats"" us to humour that would disgrace a ""Police Academy"" sequel (trust me, I would know), incomprehensible action scenes, the ugliest character designs this side of The Garbage Pail Kids and the most sanitised combat scenes in a film since ""G.I. Joe: The Movie"" (though less enjoyably). Military enrolment isn't the only thing this movie wants to advertise either, and boy, it isn't subtle about it. The one redeeming feature of this fiasco is that it features perhaps the most impressive CGI work seen in a film to date. It is also well handled and cleverly incorporated into the film, instead of sticking out like a sore thumb as CGI often does. That is enough to earn the film a pass mark. Though not a recommendation. Much as you wouldn't want the dead rat in the pretty cage, there is no need to see this film just because it looks nice on the outside.","Aug 19, 2008",5,/10
"Transformers is a film that attempts being a cinematic epic through only the depth-less method of huge explosions on a large-scale for it's special effects to play out. And when a big blockbuster action film that is bound to spawn sequels like this one is introduced for the first time in it's inevitable series, it does always result in a brainless experience only intended to entertain the simplest visual pleasures for the simplest of minds. Particularly teenage boys who are all about crude humor and hot women contrasting with dazzling CGI. But the first installment commonly comes off as decent, passable, and tolerably okay because it hasn't gotten the chance to become old, predictable, and overused in its sequels yet. Transformers is a movie you need to take at face value, because there is nothing beyond the surface. It's decent because while it is obviously nothing good, it's still the simplest of entertainment with no thought required, where it's acceptable to turn off your brain just for some explosions and special effects. However, by being this kind of movie, Transformers does inevitably set itself up for terrible sequels in which this method is not a dumb pleasure anymore, but a boring, formulaic, and weaker than the first because of the same worn down movie.","May 1, 2012",5,/10

"Saw this last night and my childhood dreams of 20 years were partially fulfilled, but overall I was quite disappointed.Now, on the plus side, the Transformers were perhaps the best CGI I've ever seen in a movie. Period. I don't see how the filmmakers could possibly have done a better job in bringing the Transformers to life on the big screen. Add in some terrific sound effects, and you can actually feel the mass of the robots as they move across the screen. The battle sequences are some of the best sci-fi action scenes that you'll ever see. Acting was good, for the most part, and the comedy had its moments.However, I felt that this movie spent too much time on the human characters and not enough time on the Transformers themselves. They simply tried packing in too many human characters with separate story lines that introducing us to all of them pushed back the arrival of the Autobots to nearly halfway through the movie. And, as a direct consequence, the robots get very little time for character development. Prime and Bumblebee are the only two who actually get personal attention. We learn enough about Megatron from what others say about him, but none of the other Decepticons (not even Starscream) gets more than a couple of lines of dialog.I could write pages and pages about how bad a director I think Michael Bay is, but I'll try to be brief. Basically, Bay would make a great Assistant Director in charge of just the action scenes of any of his movies, because he certainly has a flair for cinematic fireworks. But when it comes to telling a coherent story with three-dimensional characters, Bay is one of the worst directors in the history of film. Enough of that though; everyone knows why so many people hate Michael Bay. I'll just say that this film suffers from all of those same reasons.I gave this movie four stars, because while the Transformers themselves were spectacular, they happened to be featured in a very poorly written movie. I'm really not looking forward to the sequel unless they can find a director who takes his movies seriously.","Jul 20, 2007",4,/10
"There really is too much to say about this. I'll fit in what I can. Okay, lets go back 1 year. Superman Returns and Brian Singer lovingly recreates the spirit of the first two films in nearly every way possible. The result is a wonderful film that does more than pay homage to Richard Donner's originals.Now in 2007 and Michael Bay has basically defecated on Tranformers legacy with this 're-interpretation'. Aside from an nice opening scene, the film is almost bereft of Autobots or Decepticons for the first 45 minutes. Instead we get some some teen-angst bullshit that we've already seen too many times before in countless teen rom-coms, there's no place for it here. There's no theme tune - you know the one! Instead we get some run-of-the-mill alt-rock from Linkin Park. I could go on, but wont.On the upside there is some good action and when we aren't being subjected to the silly teen-comedy i.e. when the Transformers are actually part of the plot, it is an enjoyable film. Unfortunately its all a case of too little too late.","Jul 18, 2011",4,/10

ROBOTS IN DISGUISE!! shia lebeouf is great in this career making role, hes certainly come a long way from even stevens. megan fox, wow...she certainly is a fox. she'll definitely get a ton of more roles thrown her way. the chemistry between the two is forced in the movie, but really, what did we come to see? a love story or robots bombing LA?? yeah, the latter!","Dec 5, 2007",,

"I thought to myself before I saw this, ""If it's done right, it will get a 9/10."" I had that in mind. The movie actually started slow and attempted to build, but even the battles are boring. When it's robot vs. human, I know the outcome of the battle already, and I hated that.. But it seems that the second part of the movie is actually somewhat skillfully made. Shia LeBeouf was great as Sam Witwhicky it also had some great jokes. I swear, it works better as a comedy than an action flick, even though there's more action than humor. Still, everyone else seemed to like it, but my experience wasn't transformed enough. I'll watch a sequel with my family if it comes out. Who knows? It might be worth it.Humor: 6/10 Action:1/10 Plot: 2/10 Overall Rating: 3/10","Aug 14, 2007",,

"This movie was a blast. Such memorable jokes, and plot that was relatively unique. At almost 30 years old, I was surprised that this movie would be as ENTERTAINING as it was, and considering that it's a Michael Bay film. No other director could've pulled this off. I recommend that parents watch it first and if you're satisfied with the movie THEN watch it with you children. The jokes a pretty mild, but over all it's still a fun movie. ENTERTAINING ALL AROUND. Amybody who disagrees is probably a fan of indie films and NOT really a fan of just plain, old fun flicks. The only part that kind of made the movie drag was that the Autobots save the day so late toward the end. There's only so many ways to say it, so I'll say it again; SUCH A FUN MOVIE!","Sep 14, 2011",,
"I enjoyed this film a great deal despite the plot loopholes and over length. Michael Bay has delivered his most popcorn-friendly movie to date! There's a lot of action and the Special Effects, specially in the last thirty minutes, have to be seen to be believed. There are some comic moments, notably when the Autobots are hiding from Shia's family. The acting is alright though Jon Voight appears slightly embarrassed as the Defence Secretary. Megan Fox looks too old to still be in school but provides the requisite amount of glamor. A tighter plot would have made this more impressive but the film remains a lot of fun.Overall 7/10","Feb 5, 2009",,
"WHY would they insert sexual humor into a movie that should be marketed to kids (mostly boys, let's face it) around age 9 and up? WHY? Read the parental info elsewhere on this film if you haven't yet.We skipped this when it was in the theaters, our son was 10, but this past summer - at age 11 - we rented it, thinking it might be OK. The sex humor was unnecessary, although it probably went over our son's head. The scene where the mom brings up masturbation was just... unbelievable. I was furious (and I'm no prude; it was just completely inappropriate). My son immediately asked what that meant. Suffice to say, it made for some uncomfortable moments.But mostly I sat steaming wondering why filmmakers can't be creative without stooping to gutter humor ... the film ""The Italian Job"" was a great example of how to make an action-packed film for slightly older kids with out foul language or humor. ""Iron Man"" with Robert Downey Jr. also came *close* to being free of the stuff you really don't need to expose 11 or 12 year old kids to.If they wanted a PG-13 film (and WHY should a movie about Transformers BE a PG-13 film in the first place?!), they could have cut some of the sexual stuff and it would have been fine.But, to go further, they could have cleaned it up a bit more (and toned down some of the violence) and still had an action packed, PG film for those younger kids. Why didn't they do that? We see a summer packed with PG-13 films, which is a real shame. There are plenty of PG films out there that prove they can make money. I wish Hollywood would show some respect for kids and parents alike, and work to create more smart and entertaining films - both in the PG13 and PG categories - that don't rely on crass humor for laughs. There ARE smart people in Hollywood, right?","Aug 11, 2008",,
"I loved this film when I was younger. It was one of the few DVDs I had in the age before streaming and recording things on TV, so naturally I watched it around 20-30 times. I still remember going to the cinema to see it when I was 11, the fire alarm went off right after the prologue finished and while waiting outside the theatre for things to settle down I was talking to my brother about how awesome that first scene was.And it still looks awesome, but now it's served with a side of jingoism and seasoned with weirdly horny jokes.The CGI still holds up incredibly well in my mind, and the dynamic between Sam and his parents is a relatable joy. I wish we got less of a military showcase and more of a power fantasy with a young teenager and his kick-ass robot car. Nearly all of the subplots pertaining to the military aspects bloated the ever living hell out of the film, and this is a problem that somehow gets much worse in the sequels.Regardless, the score and soundtrack are nostalgic, and it was fun to go back to a film that's ingrained in my brain. It worked for me as a kid before I grew twice as many brain cells as the writers (around six). Maybe that's all that the film really needed to do.","Apr 9, 2025",,

"You cannot be disappointed by this movie if you are not a transformers fan because it has all the elements of a summer popcorn flick much like fantastic four. The audience in the theater did not know Optimus Prime by the signature blue truck just by him saying he was. Obviously not Transformers fans. If you are a true Transformers fan, a fan of the original 1986 movie and even more so of the 1984 animated series, then you will be highly disappointed by the movie. The humans of the movie are very ""strong"" and are able to fight against 70 foot robots. In the original series, the humans say a couple of phrases like thank you Optimus Prime and are not included in the fighting. The only good part of the movie was the action scenes in the end when the transformers actually fight against each other but these actions are very few and far between. Shia LeBeouf cracks many jokes which I don't find funny but the many 11 year olds that were able to sneak into this movie laughed hysterically. All of my friends ripped their ticket stubs in half.","Jul 7, 2007",,

"Transformers is a great movie with a pretty good storyline and a decent cast.It is a bit long but the two and a half hours fly by.I enjoyed the action in the movie,although it did go on a bit too long many times,sometimes so much that you would forget whats happening,but it is very well directed by Michael Bay.I enjoyed Shia LaBeouf a lot in this,but,although she is very attractive,Megan Fox is not a very good actress,I feel like she just says her lines and she probably wouldn't have got in to acting if it wasn't for how good looking she is,I definitely think a better actress like Emma Stone or Amanda Seyfried could have put in a better performance as this character.The best part for me is without a doubt the robots themselves,Optimus Prime,Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots and Decepticons are beautifully animated and the voice work is outstanding.While Transformers has many flaws,its still very enjoyable and I would recommend it to all fans of Michael Bay and the Transformers in general.A long fighting race of robots,the Autobots and the Decepticons,head to Earth and one young teenager might be able to fix things.","Oct 1, 2013",8,/10
"No, it is not a smart movie, or a well written one, but this movie certainly has it's goods, and one can hardly deny it is fairly entertaining.The goods were pretty obvious. Stunning visuals, brilliant editing, mind-blowing set pieces, say about mister Bay what you will, he has always had an eye for the visual. And this is an absolute plus to all his work, basically. But we can also state that Bay's previous work, with a few exception, was nonetheless fairly disappointing. Transformers went further than just the visual shebang.The movie had a good sense of humor too. It was clear that everyone knew that one can hardly take a few car robots seriously, and so no one didn't. Which is a good thing. It made the movie one hell of a lot funnier. The actor's were cool too. Shia LaBouf is a great lead role, John Turturro, John Voight, Anthony Anders and others had really cool side roles, and they made the movie worthwhile.The only downs were the ridiculousness that often crawled onto the screen, of course fault to the slightly preposterous script. Usually I cringe with issues like these, but aforementioned points somehow made the movie awfully amusing. A great watch, especially in the cinemas, but maybe somewhat less entertaining to watch on a TV. be warned","Aug 21, 2007",8,/10
"Sometimes (probably more often than not in this day and age), movies are not meant to be intensely analyzed and picked apart. If one were to do that to ""Transformers"", the review would likely come back a negative one. However, this flick requires its viewers to be one simple thing: sit back and enjoy the ride! If that can be done, ""Transformers"" will thoroughly entertain you.For a basic plot summary, ""Transformers"" focuses on high school student Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). While leading a relatively normal teenage life and trying to get the ""hot girl"" of his dreams Mikaela Barnes (Megan Fox), Sam is swept into an invasion of Earth by the evil Decepticons transformer robots. Allying with the U.S. government and the benevolent Autobots, Sam becomes central to the action due to his family lineage.If one could ever classify a film as ""whiz-bang"", this one be the textbook definition of that statement. It has everything most cinema fans want: pulse-pounding action, cool gadgets, romance, and a script that never takes a down moment...the action is always moving forward.What makes ""Transformers"" a truly quality experience, however, is the fact that the plot and characters contain a great deal of heart. The plot isn't Shakespeare, of course, but who can't relate to ""good vs. evil""? LaBeouf is absolutely perfect as Witwicky, while Fox turned herself into a national sex symbol simply by playing ""that hot girl from high school that all the boys lusted over"" & leaning over the engine of a car (!). Again, a set of characters that most individuals can relate to.Overall, ""Transformers"" will sweep you away if you can let it. Instead of nit-picking or analyzing ""the small stuff"", this is one to ""get your popcorn ready"" for!","Mar 7, 2017",9,/10
"I expected this to be an action movie only, but it also has a lot of hilarious jokes similar to American Pie, such as when the robots were making lots of noise, Sam's parents asked him something embarrassing. There is some action, but there is also drama. At least the action and drama aren't so bad. However, the characters weren't so likable. Megan Fox was just eye candy (yes, she was hot, at least) and Shia LaBeouf was not a likable character.Pros:Really funnyGood actionCons:Characters aren't so likableReview: 8","Jun 28, 2015",,
"When I saw Transformers, I will admit I wasn't expecting much. And you know what I thought it was a good movie. It is far from the best movie ever made, but it is well worth watching for a number of reasons.The best thing about the movie was the visual/special effects. They were absolutely mind-blowing, and the whole movie is worth the look just for them alone. And the robots especially Megatron were convincing enough, and the movements weren't jerky in any way. The sound is absolutely terrific, and the music is great. The storyline is original, fast-paced and gripping on the most part. There is some nice humour thrown into the mix, however the dialogue for me was a little too cheesy in places.The performances are spirited and bring a sense of fun to the proceedings. Shia LeBoeuf brings some charisma and appeal to the title role of Sam, and Megan Fox is hot. John Tuturro has fun in his role, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White are both hilarious as Sam's parents. Hugo Weaving is superb as Megatron, and Peter Cullen makes the most of his character Optimus Prime. In fact, the only weak performance came from the talented Jon Voight, he just seemed out of place. And while there are plenty of visual thrills, I wasn't a massive fan of Michael Bay's direction, it just seemed as though the visuals, story and performances were doing the work and Bay was just there making sure it was all going to plan.Overall, it is flawed but Transformers while not the best or worst of its genre is worth the look, especially if you are looking for terrific visuals, great sound and a good story. That way, if you overlook the flaws it does indeed have, you are in for a treat. 7/10 Bethany Cox","Nov 11, 2009",7,/10
It's August 9th 2020. I am watching this again for the 100th time. Never thought about reviewing it until now. As a massive fan in the 80s I was obsessed with the Comics (have them all) the toys and the tv cartoon. When I learned this was being made I had zero expectations except the trailers making it look something special. It really did not disappoint. The CGIof the robots is brilliant. The story is something that falls in line with the source material which okay isn't the most amazing of stories however it's a modern twist with elements of subtle comedy a real babe in Megan and a badass Megatron. I know people were upset with the decision to scrap Megatron turning into a gun but how would it have worked? This is by far the best of all the movies made so far.

But annoying thing about the movie is that academy ignored that amazing visual effects and gave Oscar to garbage movie named golden comps. shame on you academy. brainless and stupid people of academy are blind to awesome stuff like TRANSFORMERS.

"This movie is ACTION. I say this first because if you think this movie will be anything more than this, you will be disappointed on some level (as I was). Frame for frame this movie screams Michael Bay.Now that's out of the way, there's a lot of stuff here that works and a lot that doesn't. It's a good thing that the robots do work. Seeing autobots and decepticons in glorious photo-realistic CGI is enough to wring out any childhood fantasy from anybody (not just boys from the 80s). Watching these robots move is to realize a revelation to what is possible with modern movie effects. Whether it's transforming on the move, bashing the living daylights out of each other, or just standing and talking, these guys alone make the movie work. And unlike the other blockbusters that have came out this year, these effects have a sense of weight that adds so much to the visual satisfaction.As for everything else, well... that's when things start to go downhill. In typical epic fashion, this movie contains a sprawling cast. Along with this however, are a large number of writing and acting issues. With such a large number of underdeveloped characters, names are pretty much luxury. Also, most of the human related humor gags miss badly, which makes it hurt more considering a lot of the characters were unnecessary. Jon Voight's Secretary of Defense character completely baffles me, which makes me think that audiences responded positively to the President in Independence Day doing aerial dogfights. Any positives from the supporting cast (including the strange yet entertaining overacting of John Turturro) are outweighed by the large set of negatives.However, the cast has got it where it counts. Shia Lebeouf plays an important part in selling the reality of the robots as the lead character Sam, and also carries an easy likability factor. Megan Fox's acting does a reasonable job bringing some interest to her character to beyond her looks. The voice cast also does an overall superb job. Peter Cullen IS Prime, and although his dialogue does border on the ridiculous, he always has a sense of gravity to his lines. Hugo Weaving also does an equally commendable job as Megatron (His booming entrance will forever be embedded into the minds of little kids everywhere). The rest of the transformers don't say much, which is a shame because I wanted to see so much more interplay between them (The taunts that Optimus and Megatron yell as their fighting is great stuff).Another major gripe I have is Bay's ADD editing. Although it does keep the movie constantly moving, it creates some issues with continuity and distracts from some of the action (probably the biggest crime committed in the movie).I could go on and on about the good things (Bumblebee, Frenzy) and the bad things (Anthony Anderson and his family, forgotten Barricade) and the downright weird things (Dubya's cameo, Sam's friend climbing in a tree). Overall, the film delivers where it really matters. Although I was disappointed, the amount of potential for the sequel (which just got greenlighted) just gets me giddy (is it too much to ask for a tighter script and better acting?) (Also, the Autobot Assemble scene is one of the coolest things I've seen in theaters in years.)","Jul 2, 2007",7,/10

"Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay team up for the exciting and action packed blockbuster Transformers. Earth becomes caught up in a war between two groups of alien robots that have come in search of a device that gave life to their planet. That cast includes Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, John Turturro, and Jon Voight, who all bring a certain charisma to the film. But the real stars of the film are the special effects, which are amazing. And Michael Bay does an excellent job at delivering high energy action sequences that are visually stunning. The writing is exceptionally poor and the film goes on for far too long, but the action and the visual effects keep the audience engaged. Transformers is messy and cheesy, and sophomoric...but it's also a lot of fun and immensely entertaining.","Mar 5, 2020",,

"I watched this film at an advanced screening in New Zealand. I loved Transformers as a child, but was not a die hard fan, so I did not complain over the changes. However, I had decent expectations for this movie as people were saying it's better than expected.I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. However, it did fall a little flat on what I expected it to be. It's Michael Bay, ladies and gents, don't expect anything more.Transformers begins with the reason for the alien robots' existence. How the all important AllSpark (essentially the life giver) was lost into the vacuum of space after the robots divided between good and evil. Falling onto Earth, a handful of these entities travelled the galaxy to find this all important device. Great premise, but how about the execution? Visually, the film is astounding. ILM have outdone themselves once again and have created top notch visuals for others to measure up to. The robots look real, feel weighty yet elegant, and with every Bay movie, there are explosions. And what beautiful explosions they are. This is complemented with a hit-and-miss musical score. At times, the score is cinematic brilliance. At other times, you wonder why Linkin Park was included, when sequences with emotional pieces are suddenly juxtaposed with the current Billboard Hot 100.The acting is competent. I thought that with a cast mostly compromised of underwear models and hip hop artists, I would be disappointed. Shia LaBeouf (Sam Witwicky), Josh Duhamel (Cpt. Lennox), Tyrese Gibson (Sgt. Epps), and even Megan Fox (Mikaela) delivered surprisingly well. Even with Jon Voigt in the cast, you cannot see a distinct line in ability between the seasoned vet and relative new comers. But although the acting was top notch, it was severely hampered by the script.The script, to put it frankly, does not take itself seriously. At all. Firstly, there was a lack of story. Autobots and Decepticons want the AllSpark. One wants to defend it. The other wants to use it. Battle. Fin. Secondly, I could not remember one scene that did not have some humorous one liner put in to make the audience laugh. Even in the most grave of sequences, did some joker blurt out something (admittedly) funny, making you wonder ""Wait.... Earth's in danger, and you're cuing for a crash on the drums?!"" Some of the script was clever, and in the parts which were appropriately funny, hit the nail on the head (Shia LaBeouf is a child prodigy in comedy).Transformers. Everyone wants to know ""What about the Transformers?"". Well, personally, they were simply awesome. They could have been more 2D than they were and I still would have liked them. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Jazz, Frenzy, Ratchet... Megatron, Starscream, Bonecrusher, Barricade and Ironhide -- they were masterfully put on film.However, only two of those actually got a decent amount of character development -- Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. Bumblebee, being the first Transformer Sam sees, and Optimus, of course gets plenty of screen time being the Autobot leader. It's a shame that the Decepticons were only there to be the ""bad guys"", even Megatron. It would have definitely benefited the movie if all the robots were fleshed out and given some emotional attachment to the crowd. It doesn't, and this does have a few repercussions towards the end of the movie. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable to see them wreak havoc in different countries, and with the inevitable sequel, one can only hope that we get to know more about these ""loveable"" mechanical beings.It is definitely the must see summer flick of the year, and whilst not Oscar material, it is one of the best 'popcorn' movies of recent times.7.5/10**Upon a second screening, I found the impact of the movie to remain just the same as the first. In certain aspects, that impact heightened. New score 8/10","Jun 27, 2007",7,/10
"I was not a Transformers kid when I grew up in the 80's and I think that's why I wasn't so hard on Michael Bay's film when I caught it in the summer of 2007. Going into the film for the first time, the only characters I knew by name were Optimus Prime, Megatron, and Bumblebee (and I only knew of him through the mention of friends). So, without having the fanboy mentality, I was able to enjoy the movie as it was...and I did. I thought it was a fun action flick and one of the best popcorn movies from the year. Based on the Hasbro toyline and it's resulting animated series/comics, the film follows high-schooler Sam Witwicky who discovers his Camaro is a shape-shifting alien robot; he is soon brought into the middle of a war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, warring factions of a race of sentient robots.Let's be honest. The only things that matter about this movie are the special effects and the action sequences. ILM did a fantastic job with the Transformers in this film. The robots look amazing and their transformations are seamless. I've heard that some classic fans aren't satisfied with their designs but I felt they did a good job adding what realism they could to giant fighting robots. The action sequences aren't as abundant as one would expect, but I'm not complaining. I felt there were enough action scenes without going overboard and drowning out story. The battles feel epic and they aren't heavily edited into quick jump cuts so you can still understand what is going on.The cast does an adequate job and keep the movie from feeling B-grade. Shia LaBeouf was charismatic and had a good sense of comedic timing; John Turturro was a fun addition as the mental Sector 7 agent Simmons. Jon Voight seemed almost out of place in the film, though added a bit of class. I know there have been a lot of complaints about human characters in the movie, but it's a necessary element and I'm not complaining. The supporting cast did a great job; my favorites had to be Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's eccentric parents. I felt the movie shouldn't have gone over 2 hours as it does begin to strain on the patience after a while but it still made for a fun ride.","Aug 17, 2009",8,/10

A lot of the humans are annoying and others are boring but it's their over the top acting and dumb decision making that keep me entertained. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky he is a good enough teen though his motivation for most of the film is Megan Fox.

"For me just hearing the words ""Autobot"" and ""Decepticon"" brings back so many childhood memories. I was a massive fan of the G1 cartoons (never watched any of the spin-offs) and the Marvel comic books from the UK and US. The cartoon appealed to me as a child, while the comics took the mythos deeper in my teenage years with cosmic battles between Gods, a yin/ yang conversation regarding why certain Transformers are inherently good or evil. It was cracking stuff and it was with a lot of excitement that I greeted news of a new big budget movie.Transformers (2007) delivered! OK, so they fiddled with the origin story a little bit, but so do most of the different versions of the show. I thought they got the major characters spot on. Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron and Starscream were all the same characters as in the TV show and comics. I really liked the fact that Bumblebee could only communicate through radio signals, and, after the execrable scene introducing the minor autobot characters and Optimus Prime's various sermons, really wish that had been the case for all of the autobots. The decepticons are far more interesting, though we see nowhere near enough of Starscream. Megatron and Soundwave are both effective and the best realised characterisations in the film.The humans in the story all do a good job. Shia Lebeouf had not yet been over exposed, and is actually quite entertaining as Spike. Megan Fox was a smoking hot brunette bombshell, still playing a stereotype (hot girl with a blokey hobby who deep down just wants to fit in), but at least not a damsel in distress as we typically see in these films. Spike's parents are awkward, but funny. John Turtorro's character seems to have accidentally stumbled into this film during a coffee break from a Coen brothers film. He seems like he has something much more interesting to do in an edgier film than this one. But his presence, while out of place, is welcome.My big complaint with this is that the the film, after doing a nice job of setting up for a finale, seems to go in light speed in its last twenty minutes. It's often difficult to tell who's fighting who. There's also a death scene that we are supposed to feel sad about, involving a character who's been in a handful of scenes, and had a maximum of two lines of clichéd stereotyped dialogue. The resolution is neat and sets up well for a sequel. Overall, this was a reasonably faithful big screen portrayal of the characters I loved growing up, if not the story. The arrival sequence, and Armageddon-ish soundtrack are both breathtaking and really hammer home a sense of awe and wonder as the Autobots arrive. The awkward attempts by Prime to communicate with humanity are funny. The human characters, apart from Turtorro (who acts like no human I've ever met) all seem to react to the Transformers and their war in the way a normal human being would react. It is a very different back story and beloved elements like the Autobot and decepticons Volcano and underwater bases are lost. But what's left is a the characters we love fighting out the same war, in a way a new generation will find accessible, and didn't alienate me, well not in this original version anyway. I am more than happy to share Optimus, Megatron and Bumblebee with a new generation of fans.","Sep 18, 2012",9,/10
"This movie is simply shocking! The story is taken from a children's cartoon and is now turned into an action packed alien take over the world movie. When I was about to see this movie I suddenly got a thought. What if this movie is just another Independence Day and War of the World. It is unmistakable that aliens taking over the world is an idea that has been worn out but what makes this movie shine is the personality. What its predecessors failed to do was give the alien/robot personality which is very different in Transformers. When one of the Autobots get hurt we can actually feel there pain as if they were human because of there developed characters in this movie.
